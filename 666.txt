Jamie_ - I was taking a look in the Team Dashactyl drama channel to find someone talking about this host. They first pointed out that their website guarantees 100% uptime.

Well that's not true: 

The bottom 3 buttons just refresh the home page

I then made a ticket asking for the TOS. He happily gave it to me and I mentioned it was now linked on the website to which he said nothing too. Then I asked for their Privacy Policy. 

They are selling servers without a Privacy Policy and their trust pilot shows they have had customers before so I am assuming they have not had one for quite a while.

They are selling minecraft servers for $0.60 a month with 100% uptime guaranteed. According to someone in the dashactyl discord, they have a $200/m dedi and are overselling. 

I can't comment on that as I don't know myself.

Someone wanted me to post this for them so they can stay undercover and they can keep learning stuff from the owner. This is what he has found out and wrote so far. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-03/1622742415-356154-image.png

xKcz - Hey I am the Owner of AstralNodes
Our Website Theme is not finished yet
As I just started working on it not long ago


Our Terms of Services and Privacy Policy is ready now
It wasn't when we talked in the tickets
Here are the Links to it 



https://www.astralnodes.net/tos.pdf
https://www.astralnodes.net/privacy.pdf

Our buttons will be fixed in a moment and we aren't overselling servers
All our servers that our clients have are working fine so we have no problem


Our uptimes is 99.92230% because sometimes we reboot the nodes to give users a better performance or to add new features

I dont know who you are but I want no problem
AstralNodes is a small host trying to make everyone happy with cheap servers and good performance 

Our $0.60 Price is going to raise in the future and we pay $200 Monthly because most of us have working jobs and can pay for the dedicated server at the end of the month.

I dont see anything wrong with AstralNodes 
If you do
Feel free to dm me on discord - ùêäùêú„ÉÑ#4496
I will try to correct and fix them
Thanks for your time
Jamie_ - xKcz Our uptimes is 99.92230% because sometimes we reboot the nodes to give users a better performance or to add new features

I was going to happily request for this to be resolved as everything has been fixed it looks like but you don‚Äôt almost get 99.8% uptime from node reboots.
Jamie_ - @Jedrik Can this just me marked as resolved and closed please as it seems most of the issues like TOS and Privacy Policy are fixed.
Ash777 - so you want to say you hate that guy ?
PrestonJude - Ash777 I just dont want to work for him anymore. and exposing how bad he really is
Ash777 - what is it to even expose ? that he didnt liked your work and cursed on you
PrestonJude - Ash777 No, its not just that
BaconHead - If you look at this image, he says that most of the people in the astralnodes team have jobs.
But in the screenshot he said he was 14? Maybe he has teamed up with some older people with jobs but I find it a bit unlikely that an older person would team up with a 14 year old. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-08/1623160383-224445-screen-shot-2021-06-08-at-45007-pm.png
PrestonJude - BaconHead No, its only 2 people in the astral team that have jobs
Jamie_ - BaconHead unlikely that an older person would team up with a 14 year old.

agreed.
Jamie_ - Welp, their node just got cancelled - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-30/1625074145-682980-image.png
Yie - Jamie_ they prolly didn't even pay for it ü§∑
SilentBot - Just to round this up, there was two people who were in charge with funding the operation. One called Keeper7 and the other called Cambrey1. They were both working and footing the $240/mo server from ReliableSite as well as all the other fees for WHMCS, WISP (which they never got implemented), and everything else essentially.

Myself and Snow provided provided all people with links to their backup via email and provided support to any of the people who needed a hand getting back up and running on other hosts.

At the end of things before all data was lost, they were earing $242/mo by overselling their memory by 28% and their CPU by 108% with frequent node downtimes and restarts caused by an unknown reason, assumed to be memory related based on the monitoring we (myself and Snow) setup for free due to the issues they were experiencing.



All the staff were nice people in all honesty, but had no clue what they were doing.

If there's any questions outside of locking / closing this thread, fire away and I'll see what I can answer. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-05/1638740797-663883-image.png
