Sloth - What is Private Messaging on Winterhoax?
When Winterhoax started we wanted to allow a means of private conversations on the forum, so we created a end-to-end encrypted chat system which can be found in the header next to the "Search Forum“ form.


Why is it being removed?
We are trying to keep bulk down, and having a feature as difficult to upkeep as a end-to-end encrypted chat system we would like to know if it is even worth it.

If you are using this feature please let me know by commenting so I won’t remove it - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-08-14/1597436552-899598-bildschirmfoto-2020-08-14-um-221732.jpeg
