Ryder - I don't usually to this but it has come to such a point that I have to do this.
As you know MVP who was famous for DDoSing previously is back scamming.
He has been here since alot of time but he never scammed someone like this.
As you all know I recently bought my-licences.uk for around 500$ BTC (Around 2.7k$ USD after P2P transaction)
The deal was everything to be transferred to me specially the licenses system which required 150$ / month to be renewed and the whole thing made over 200$ a month easily somtimes it was even more than 400$ a month.
After purchasing all I have got so long is the discord server and a Shared API access to create liceneses. The deal was too that he would never start the licensing business again but there we go its broken!
I have asked him repeatedly to transfer the domain to me and give the complete account access however upto the date it had not happened. When started being strict about it he went mad and said he would give everything and let me fuck off lul
I was gone to work during that time (night shift for me). I came back home almost around 3 am and gone to sleep. When I woke up all I see is my DM's being spammed that their reseller hosting is down licenses are not working and what not. When I investigated it further I came to know that the scammer (MVP) has suspended the hosting for the domain eu0.co.uk where all files were hosted. 
The cPanel server where everything was hosted had the password changed.
The admin login for my-licences.uk has been changed too 
All reseller hosting hosted on his cPanel server is down too. He had scammed alot for VPS's 


And funny thing is just after yesterday someone had port mapped my servers doing web hosting and VPS Hosting 

Coincidence?

And right now he started selling licenses at my-licences.uk which he promised not to. RN He had scammed me for 450$ lets say since I only got ownership of discord server which would be worth around 50$ and alot of other clients for over 400-500$ surely.
This is an old thread of him on revenact https://revenact.io/threads/lets-discuss-mvp-mcfreehosting.434/ - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-10-06/1601964265-763570-image.png

Ryder - Moreover he asked the group owner of a group to remove me for no reason. 

However I know the reason of it because he was getting exposed too bad - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-10-06/1601965132-891793-image.png
TheMGDEV - Bought allot of things. I said that it was an amazing place to buy things from but not anymore! I bought around $40 worth of things from him and he just says "I resign" in announcements! He then shut down EVERYTHING that he "owned". I'm pissed. He is a full fucking scammer. No wonder he couldn't get a job smh.
Ryder - On asking the reason for suspending the hosting for the domain where all important files were hosted was that ryder is a cunt and he can host it on his server which is funny enough that I did not even have access to that domain neither those files
Ryder - Another funny thing is the excuse of him saying he is at work but he have had enough time to change all passwords? Suspend domains? Port scan ? wait wtf?
TheMGDEV - Ryder Yea, sounds sus.. Oh wait... He just scammed us... Nevermind
Deleted User - Bet MVP is happy when he got everything lol.
STMR - I was at work ^^ then came home n feel asleep yet i'm the scammer here I could find more if needed - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-10-06/1601979252-7439-image.png

MCKingSam - What ryder has done is absolutely unacceptable.
Ryder - Have I ever scammed anyone? Show me a transaction proof?
Ryder - Unacceptable what? Some one has got enough time to change passwords?
Ryder - Explain me all those images you have sent palpatine bc none of them makes sense?
Ryder - Your dumb excuses wont work anymore bc I already gave explanation of upcoming excuses you make.
"Another funny thing is the excuse of him saying he is at work but he have had enough time to change all passwords? Suspend domains? Port scan ? wait wtf?"
Ryder - Can you explain how twitch botting is a law breaking? Are cigars illegal in India? And  hat about I03Y guy? He purchased license from you not me. You do know that I dont even know my-licences. I dont own domain neither the company. Whats wrong in asking someone to test the protection? Unless you are blind to forget the test word? All shit you sell is cracked?
Ryder - And for your nice cut picture here is a full one - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-10-06/1601980618-843448-image.png
Ryder - Transaction proof of what he has scammed.

Ryder - I have got more want them?
Ryder - And for your twitch botting? Whats this arc botting? - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-10-06/1601981123-39730-image.png
STMR - Twitch botting is illegal ofc it is why would it not be.

you have scammed people when the RDP's went down and you never replaced nor refunded multiple times

 i changed 2 passwords while at work, I never port scanned on your shit nor do i have access to anything on your dedi so this is a lie
Ryder - Little more - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-10-06/1601981272-904325-image.png
Ryder - STMR Twitch botting is not against law. If it is aint arc botting too?
And what RDP's provide proof?
STMR - and did i continue it ....

also the date dif.
Ryder - do you have proof of me continuing it?
STMR - that's another 1
Ryder - A picture proof? And yeah please show me the laws where it says if i bot twitch I'll be put in jail or something
Ryder - And I never sold that
Ryder - I was a middleman in that deal. Show the fill pic.
STMR - Currently, viewbotting is not illegal and is considered a civil matter for now. Nevertheless, there is always the chance that a streamer viewbotting could be tried in court for wire fraud, but so far, that has yet to happen. Twitch has been vigorously dealing with the viewbotting epidemic.
Ryder - Currently, viewbotting is not illegal
Ryder - Your first words
STMR - yet it's still not allowed via TOS but you still do it
STMR - you "could" be taken to court
Ryder - I have asked proof of me doing it
Ryder - And sure that should not be your concern on how I deal it
STMR - 500$ BTC (Around 2.7k$ USD after P2P transaction) also that's fake 

$500 BTC could get you around 600-700 if your lucky I just knew what I was doing to rack it up like I did.
Ryder - That dosent matter after all you have scammed
STMR - I was at work and you said you was opening a dispute + taking action + posting here and you still wanted me to fix.

hahaha no
Ryder - I did not even bother you to fix it after you changed all pass because its sure you have scammed ?
Changing pass suspending domains from the work yeah sure sure
STMR - until I got home yes because I was tired of your shit I even spoke to zappy about it and he was fine until you opened your mouth
Ryder - Till the time zappy spoke to you I had access to the WHMCS admin area of my-licenses. Why did you change it?
Ryder - You were a proved hoax in the summer hoax. Good old days now we have baised admins. This thread will be deleted for sure
STMR - by that time you have said you were opening a dispute do you think i'm going to let you keep it all and open a dispute also removing my reseller why would I not you tried to scam me
Ryder - I said I'll be opening a dispute if you go further and have not zappy spoke to you during then?
And you come on twitch botting while you are a reseller of it
Ryder - You were not able to provide a account access and the reason clearly was you were hiding behind and selling the API access to others. And I have a proof for that too
STMR - I don't twitch bot tho I had reseller but seems you removed it just another thing against you 

good luck paying $300 for something you would be paying 150
Ryder -  - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-10-06/1601982183-112214-image.png
Ryder - The reason I bought it was for 150$ / month to renew it? Wasn't that the deal if you have forgotten
STMR - before it was sold and that's the 40% off code not the unlimited
Ryder - The deal was for unlimited not 40% off lul gl lying
Ryder -  - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-10-06/1601982290-230593-image.png
STMR - it was for unlimited on the $40 off he pays $190 and licenses cost me $1-$2 max
Ryder - Wasn't that the backup one?
STMR - it's a lifetime license never expires
Ryder - And yeah did the deal include something about "not selling the licenses anymore"&gt;&gt;?
Ryder - And moreover did I pay 500$ for a discord server?
STMR - why would I give you two licenses when the one you used was unlimited so you want me to give you L2H which made 1000's + the unlimited license + the lifetime license for $500 I could get more with my eyes closed.
STMR - Ryder I'm not selling licenses I'm selling reseller completely different
Ryder - And yeah did the deal include something about "not selling the licenses anymore"&gt;&gt;?
Ryder - Whatever it is it contains a word called licenses
STMR - Ryder it's not a license tho it's a reseller account
Ryder - Reseller account that creates licenses am I right?
STMR - correct but I don't directly sell licenses tell me where it says I can't sell reseller.
STMR - it's my other code not your one so you can't stop that.
Ryder - Back to topic. 
1) I dont own domain
2) I dont have access to the licensing system
3) I dont have the access to the files (Lul i cant even backup due to this kid)
4) Password of my-licences.uk and the l4h acc changed 
5) You have said that you are suspending all licenses here


I have made 15$ from this. Sure you can terminate all licenses lets see how you are going to pay the rest since I dont even own anything ( The 1000's and more) - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-10-06/1601982635-683486-image.png
Ryder - Paid 500$ for a inactive discord server.
Ryder - All the evidences are above. I dont really hope much from the baised admins working here but sure
Ryder - And people who have lost their services do chargeback.
STMR - you still owe me $110 remember that but wait you want me to jump and lick your ass, not happening I aint like the other people and you are not telling me what to do when your the one who owes money still.
STMR - so now your calling out @Sloth and @AYS for being biased
Ryder - I dont owe you anything bc i dont even have access to it. You can enjoy what you have scammed so far.
STMR - no problem I will and I'l continue selling the licenses to make up for that 110
Ryder - I am calling @AYS biased bc he is. All threads were taken down since you asked it to be. 
here is a proof for that too - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-10-06/1601983033-203633-image.png
Ryder - Paying me to delete the whole server where winterhoax was hosted on when it used ghosty.host
Ryder - Thats how you usually get rid of posts @ winterhoax.com and pretty sure this will be deleted too
Ryder - And good luck scamming dear
STMR - Yep I did that and would do it again tbh would have been your downfall for going through with it and I made you lose a customer :)
Ryder - Oh you did? How dumb people can be sure.
STMR - What if this thread stays just embarrassing your self right now
Ryder - No its actually exposing you too bad
Ryder - On how you scam to earn money
Ryder - You sadly keep flexing the 2.7k Eur but I make that in less than 10 days
AYS - My-licenses thread was deleted because it wasnt a hosting but just a license reseller or how you call it
STMR - ^^^ thank you AYS and to think i would even need to scam you ryder since i've know you for a long time you should know better but what ever
Ryder - No it clearly is being biased. You know it and actually most of the WH community knows it. And yeah one more thing wasn't my-licences operating as MCFH LTD which was a host?
STMR - nope MCFH LTD Is not even registered please check again
Ryder - Go and check your own company logs. Find a place where it calls the renaming of it.
Jedrik - yikes
STMR - Do you mean this

https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/11616161

how retarded do you have to be to not be able to google it./
Ryder - I mean this - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-10-06/1601983812-350113-image.png
STMR - which is no longer a host see how the name has changed because we do not deal with that anymore
Ryder - Sadly the previous thread was made before the company name changed
STMR - and that means anything why
Ryder - The logic of thread being removed for not being a host is broken
Jedrik - Thread will be confirmed as soon as either AYS or Dziaod gets on their main device since I don't have perms and it isn't working for AYS
STMR - So he scams and gets away with it is what your saying
Ryder - Who scams is clearly seen. All evidences on top. You have not provided a single evidence of me scamming.
Ryder - Wont be replying anymore on this thread going to work in a few
STMR - you scammed $110 i paid for l2h to be renewed as you was gona let it suspend and wont pay back
STMR - and expect me to give you
Ryder - I never had account access. I aint paying for shared shit? - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-10-06/1601984955-137378-image.png
Ryder - Heading off to work again.
STMR - AGAIN I PAID YOU DID NOT
Ryder - Never had account access even when the plan was covered in the 500$ I paid. I have not paid 500$ for a discord server okay?
STMR - and you would have access when you paid the last 110 to late now you have paid 500 for a discord server
Jen - Lets be honest and stop protecting Palp @AYS Cause your ass is bias af
Palp is a scammer and he will never change okay, Just verify this post and get it over with
Ryder hasn't scammed he is an honest buyer. Its not his fault he was scammed
@AYS if your Bias ass didnt work here this post would be verified already
Jedrik - Jen It will be verified but neither I or AYS are able to add the confirmed tag atm so we're waiting on dziaod :)
Ryder - I don't even trust you anymore the way you have scammed me. Making me pay 500$ for a dead discord server. Don't know why I even trusted you when you were a verified scammer at revenant and summerhoax.
eraters - revenact**
Ryder - On phone. Mistyped sorry.
STMR - Jen incorrect he has scammed as he owed $110 and never paid still expected the account...
Ryder - Wrong. I don't owe you and nor will. As I have said before I ain't paying for something I'll never get access to. Even when it was paid when I did the 500$ I never got access to the account completely. I asked repeatedly to give access to the account. Check our own chats if you don't believe it but you never did for particularly no reason. And I know the reason and that is you wanted to scam me after all giving access to others to the API which is already proven.
Ryder - And ain't you happy for selling a dead discord server for 500$ LMFAO??? Lamar sells ads for 15 euro which gets 900+ members. The one you gave doesn't even have 800
Ryder - Lamaker* stupid autocorrect
MCKingSam - Palpatine has done nothing wrong and was just defending himself. Also, @Jen fuck off out of this situation, you're not needed
Ryder - You're not needed too. And what palp has done wrong is all seen
Ryder - He has made another scamming area. Stay aware. Which he once said once it's gone it's gone when I was buying it and yet here we go again. Make sure you don't get scammed over this. This whole thing is to spread awareness. Which once summerhouse was.
STMR - says the one who scammed for 110 fuck off lmfao
Ryder - Says who never sent a 110$ payment lmfao
Ryder - Kiddo
Ryder - Go get a proper job and stop faking one
STMR - No i had to pay your bill because you was going to let it terminate
Ryder - No because I never had access to pay the bill to check your fucking history chats
Ryder - Scammer
STMR - You did I gave you all perms and you still did not pay
Ryder - No I was not even able to see a fucking product and service?
STMR - really so your IP is logged at tickets and services by l4h
Ryder - Yes that's when u fucking paid the invoice
STMR - i paid a day after as it was suspended as no one did anything and we would lost 150 and have to pay the 300
Ryder - Nah shit Sherlock and I even asked account access before you paying the bill. Hats about that then?
Ryder - https://discord.com/channels/@me/753811411712475266/759762195944439838
Ryder - You paid the next day BC and said account sorted but I still did not have root access
Ryder - Good luck with your scam. The karma will come for you for sure

Ryder - @AYS @Sloth when is this even going to be confirmed?
Jedrik - Dziaod might be asleep and AYS is doing something sooo
Ryder - How did this get confirmed then? 

while it was started 7 hours ago and this thread was started 21 hours ago - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-10-07/1602039810-906789-image.png
Jedrik - errr 🤷‍♂️ I already ask for perms to add confirmed to threads dzia hasn't done that yet and dk bout that
Ryder - Starting a fake my-licences.uk and saying the one I bought was fake. LOL. You'll make nothing. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-10-07/1602040343-701134-image.png
Ryder - Why MVP is a scammer.
1) Giving only discord server instead of domain + cpanel access + root account for liceneses
2) Paying for threads to be removed. He did that many times. Proof of one provided too above.
3) Starting a new my-licenses which he was not allowed to according to the deal and saying that the one I own is fake
4) Scamming &amp; DDoSing
Ryder - 1) Proved 
2) Proved 
3) Proved 
4) Scamming is obviously proved and ddosing is proved by the old threads at revenact and summerhoax
Jen - @Sloth please just confirm this.
That way we can get this over with
Ryder - Not sure about this but I even had a DDoS yesterday which is really rare. Can this be coincidence? - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-10-07/1602041890-128333-image.png
Ryder - Did not have any attacks past 30 days. Its funny how I got it within these 2-3 days. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-10-07/1602041968-156673-image.png
yuzu - STMR 

I can't remember you asking me for consent of posting my screenshots? (By law you have to)
   
   If you are trying to make ryder look bad here, palp was the owner when that happened with the banning licenses,
      But he later reimbursed me with some Money.
