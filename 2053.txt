Daldude1 - First of all, I want to say that they do not have a website and they also do not have a company ToS.

They take up to 1 month to deliver the vps and there are times that they leave their clients out

I decided to go on his discord and look at a couple of things, ask why the comments had such bad reviews, which seemed suspicious to me, then a manager asked me if I had bought any services, I said no and he said "Then you shut up And that's when I got banned.

Also reading the message history I found that they had had problems with another user who was also a client, had problems with their services and was suspended from the server

Another thing, they do not have any type of legal company registration, not even a ToS service
Their clients are constantly complaining about their vps being slow and they also put them up for maintenance from time to time. What makes me hesitate, maybe a free trial?

I met one of your clients, who decided to withdraw his service because supposedly they put his vps in maintenance and never delivered it again

Is this how ApestCloud treats its users, just wondering?
Why does it take so long to ship your service?
Why do your maintenance coincide between each date and last so long?
Why do your customers constantly complain?

This thread is to remind those people who want to buy a cheap VPS or at a very low price, the dangers it can lead to, it is obvious that you will lose money on pests, as well as the waiting time.
I also remind the community to be aware of legal dealings and check if it is a legal and registered company! - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-10-06/1665087058-198098-sin-titulo.png
