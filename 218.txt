NexusGamers - Alright this thread is done but just see 7 march.
_MrKnight_ - FUN FACT: CLOUDE NODES IS A REVAMP OF DARKNODES (THE OWNER IS SAME THE BOTS SAME THE NODES SAME JUST RENAMED IT)
_MrKnight_ - sorry for the cap
MyNameIsRinax - okay
NexusGamers - _MrKnight_ yea it was rebrand but no rebrand  with no strategy
Deleted User - He once mentioned that he "runs a sub bot" and it is kinda suspicous that he has like 10 youtube channels.I know this because of he gave me access to his google account for controlling a new "node".

He also use gcloud for his node. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-02-21/1613892273-111791-image.png

English: You didn't know there's a rules that you did not ask me first? First of all you are using 7.7GB Ram and space without my permissions and without asking my permissions for the second time you allocated more ram and space to your server!
Indonesia: Anda tidak tahu ada aturan yang tidak Anda tanyakan dulu kepada saya? Pertama-tama Anda menggunakan Ram 7,7GB dan ruang tanpa izin saya dan tanpa meminta izin saya untuk kedua kalinya Anda mengalokasikan lebih banyak ram dan ruang ke server Anda!
