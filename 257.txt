Jedrik - You may have noticed the "discussion" tag is missing, If you'd like to discuss certain topics, joke around, or ask a question please do so in our Discord: Join

They are generallly annoying and ruin the experience of users, especially those who [only] come to read about hosts or verify the trustworthiness of hosts via winterhoax. They are annoying to moderate and keep track of.

If you come over to the Discord please remember to follow our rules given in the information channel and to not be toxic.

Please let me know what you think of this, are you fine with keeping discussions, jokes, and questions out of the site and kept in the discord, or would you prefer having them on the site?
