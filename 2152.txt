SoSad - Catspin Who gives a fuck if you got demoted on some random host that barely anyone knows
PlurrYT - Hello im owner of kolama host catspin aka ragespin got demoted and suspended for mass abusing of Kolama TOS and Termination Policy and Privacy Policy.
This thread is fully invalid and only reason why catspin did it this bc he wana get back his admin perms. But sorry we will not unsuspend abuser what says in T13 (Termination Policy Punkt 13).
Best Regards PlurrYT, Kolama Team.
PlurrYT - SoSad this host only ooened landing page is still in dev but we provide powerful free plans for everyone.. and as well we use paid vps for it so we just dont know how to bind domain to port 90 for example bc we use port 80 for panel.

GeoHasCameBack - PlurrYT who
Kowone - this whole thread shows that kids shouldn't be running, or working for a host in any way possible
GeoHasCameBack - Kowone facts
SoSad - PlurrYT When running a business your gonna have to give out private info
SoSad - Also idk why you had a problem giving out your age its not like they can use it to find where you live
LewisG - SoSad well i mean somebodys age is personal infomation that doesnt have to be public
SoSad - LewisG He is running a business or company or whatever if your gonna do that your gonna have to expect that some of your personal info will be public
FatGrizzly - SoSad business? company? since when?
LewisG - SoSad well that would be your name, address, date of birth so if hes running a company you'd be able to get his date of birth yourself from companies house (assuming its registered in the UK)
Kolama_PlurrYT - Well we changed vps to new one what is hosted on geo-vm.net paid plan

So kolama is now secure and save thanks for this thread old "staff" what abused his admin powers.
Catspin - basicly. dont harast kolama.
Catspin - Kolama_PlurrYT i did not want them to go as far to ddos OK
Catspin - LewisG nope not registerd
Kowone - this shit still alive?
Kolama_PlurrYT - Kowone imagine its not shit and this host got new node what is 100% will be not deleted etc due its from geo-vm net
Kowone - Kolama_PlurrYT what a joke
Kolama_PlurrYT - Kowone hum?
Kolama_PlurrYT - Catspin pov: u dont know anything and speak
Catspin - Man... im sorry
Justin - Jesus, this is just a shitshow. Please, parents... Get a grip of you children's network usage. please..?
