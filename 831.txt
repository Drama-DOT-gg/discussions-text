danielpy - hi, I'm here to talk about this hosting run by vhodou.  This hosting in addition to using the free trial offered by linode of 100 credits https://cdn.virtualnodes.ml/img/unknown-1.png , 2 of its administration members (unseenacoustics and sanildos) have had to leave the hosting because vhodou in addition to behaving like a child had to do everything as he wanted at all cost.  https://cdn.virtualnodes.ml/img/Screenshot_2021-07-26-00-11-39-918_com.discord.jpg https://cdn.virtualnodes.ml/img/Screenshot_2021-07-26-00-11-48-501_com.discord.jpg https://cdn.virtualnodes.ml/img/unknown.png .

TheLegit - danielpy Is there a way to know whether the host uses a linode free trial or not?
europa - TheLegit just ipinfo their ips, no host should be using linode regardless of if it's a free trial or not
