MysteriousK69 - Hello everyone,

Today, me and my friend got finished working on a bot that detects miners running on servers. And, the bot found a regular Minecraft server.

Nothing new in the console, and just the regular files in the file manager. But, when our team checked the "whitelist.json", we found out that he was indeed mining "WINK" using the "unmineable" mining pool.

This thread is just to alert you about this desperately poor kid. If you have a server made by him, please confirm that he is not mining anything.

Here is the proof (given by Willypro7) in MoonHost,

Chirag - MysteriousK69 damn, that's big brain. but more of a small brain move to mine on a shitty free host lol.
Willypro7 - Chirag lol
Chirag - Willypro7 I've mined on free hosts a lot lmao, especially dan bot host
MysteriousK69 - By the way, don't ask me for the miner. I ain't giving it for obvious reasons.
Chirag - why tf are you using a freenom domain tho.
MysteriousK69 - Chirag ikr, most free hosts use Contabo, and you can't mine shit with Xeon E5-2620 v3's, and Epyc 7282's.
Willypro7 - Chirag was the old domain, now we have a xyz, I was too lazy to change all Germany 1 allocations manually :moyai:
FC5570 - Chirag this is exactly why I hate you, you have no fucking life, all you do is mine or nuke on free hosts, go outside more and socialize with people dumbfuck
eraters - FC5570 We love chirag, he diskfills and mines kn hosts that deserve it
ItzJack - FC5570 hey give me link of your host
ItzJack - eraters fuck off kid chirag is underage skid
Chirag - ItzJack I'm not underage. I can prove it lmfao.
eraters - ItzJack he's older than i am
Chirag - eraters nah, I'm 13 lol
eraters - Chirag oh shit i thought you were 15
MysteriousK69 - Chirag ain't that underage lol
MysteriousK69 - ItzJack Lmao you are the one whose English is no better than that of a 10-year-old.
ItzJack - MysteriousK69 Ik when I got angry then my english become worst and i was at phone at that time
MysteriousK69 - ItzJack Your English is still shit.
FC5570 - ItzJack I don't have one
Timanttikuutio - eraters everyone loves chirag for what he does, free hosts deserve to get nuked and diskfilled
J0SH - This guy acted like he was a millionaire when he sent a message in our general chat saying he'd "extracted" $50 from crypto mining, hilarious.
J0SH - Timanttikuutio I thought drama.gg was about helping hosts fix their problems ahem @Jedrik
eraters - MysteriousK69 it aint
