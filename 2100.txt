JohnWicktherock - So there is a new "VPS" host that i see many people joined, i tried to see the website browsing the discord and i saw many flaw in the website,
There is no Legal documents in the websites (Probably TOS too)
 There is too many typos in the website
 In the about page, the reviews is a placeholder
 The knowledge section is not found like the other section

If you want to investigate it yourself go here:

PadowYT2 - Well it takes time to make a host imo
PadowYT2 - Well they are out of IPs already, also Credits page gives a 500 error
