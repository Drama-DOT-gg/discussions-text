Well I was the Bot Developer of the Old G-host and it was fine under alpha's control , but for some unconditional reason , he had to make someone owner because he was about to be offline for some months , and Yes to Skie Dev , Problem is he told us and alpha about upgrading nodes and other componets of website and panel , which was good deed , but when alpha's time has come to go offline , he took over control over g-host nodes and everything , and start merging with Javacraft.best ( which is already exposed in Drama.gg ) , we and few staffs went against but its for nothing , and soon after the Paid/Premium Users who bought legally has been ignored and they are not even giving them refund nor their servers , everything is gone , data , money , hope and everything , few of them are complaining to us about it and we can't do anything , So all I am doing is exposing the new Hosting they are forming .
1) Resetting Nodes after 24 hours and warned user like 23 hours ago that nodes will reset and completed within 1 hour .
2) Merging with exposed Server Hosting Drama.gg
3) Not refunding Money or Services to the Premium/Paid Users and Ignoring them
4) Taking over all nodes and start Bossing around Staffs [ But he was employed as temporary Owner ]

NotPark - The new owner is a kid I think cause if he was a man he would have given better service then alpha #stupidkids ololololollolololololololol.
SidisLiveYT - NotPark Yeap he is ! Kiddos hosting
NotPark - SidisLiveYT kids these days ufffff
MemeyGoDOP - Dude they just shut the host for premium users like the new owner for the server is a kid lol I wonder where he gets time for all this stuff
MemeyGoDOP - #kidscammer
SidisLiveYT - MemeyGoDOP Yeah Right !!
dchu096 - addon infos - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-17/1623958788-584866-image.png
dchu096 - G host is deleted anyways... dunno why but it vanished
SidisLiveYT - dchu096 a nice attempt to clearing proofs ! Damn Nuked whole server !
SidisLiveYT - dchu096 Still Paid Users aren't getting refund or services they paid for ! Scam !
dchu096 - SidisLiveYT ????????? i didnt nuke it? Skiedev did
SidisLiveYT - dchu096 Did I mentioned you did anything ? I was mainly concern about Refund and Service what Premium Users paid for !
dchu096 - Poor alpha, the host was just growing now its down. I was concerning about the paid users too! rn the servers deleted they have no way to even get a refund. Oh well... they should have read what i told them to ask me to sort out the thing and leave... 🤷
SidisLiveYT - dchu096 That announcement was their for like 1 hour or 2 ! And you expect to trust with their data now ?? Would you do that ? I denied partnership at the moment skiedev became the owner of G-host !
SidisLiveYT - These Guys like Skie Dev Destroy Host and Recreate because they own some i9 Nodes ! And all the Users get Scammed and lack trust for other good Hosting ! Slowly the whole Hosting Community getting hate by such people !
SidisLiveYT - Alpha's Account [ old Owner ] got hacked and Whole Discord Server has been Deleted ! What a play Skie ! Because we know , alpha will not do such a un-healthy practice and I have a nice proof 


, We know alpha and his dedication about his small company , yes he once got exposed because of tos and other stuff but he managed to correct himself and even ask my help to make the hosting a nice one ! He even refund to all users on previous one so why would he do that ?? Skie Dev ?? - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-18/1623986774-482643-screenshot-20210618-083804-gmail.png
dchu096 - So skiedev hacked his account and set a 2FA then put on schudled deletion??
dchu096 - I will submit a discord thread for that
SidisLiveYT - dchu096 Thats what proof said !
SidisLiveYT - dchu096 Do, But whats the good ? he will make a alt !
dchu096 - But its better if he can just have his main account so he have the owners of other servers (if he even have it)
Skie - Lmao, reporting me for nothing. I do not even hack discord accounts and do you even have valid proof of that??
Skie - Lmao, this thread is a troll thread, it should be deleted @Jedrik
Skie - You realise that's dumb, when you don't even have valid proof of someone hacking something that I didn't hack. You can say I did and say all that shit that I did. I came on to G-Host to re-brand it and fix all the issues it had, is there anything else you would like to say?
SidisLiveYT - Skie Seriously ? You want proof ? First you were having all the nodes password and take down every one of them and changed password ! We already own many proofs beyond your reach !
Second Skie ? Everyone was against you and even Alpha banned you for this hosting scam reason ! What you think ?? all of a sudden within an hour a Hosting Server got deleted and owner has been hacked ?
SidisLiveYT - Skie you came to mege with a exposed host ? should I show the staff chat ? 
you want me to bring every staff here ?
SidisLiveYT - Skie you are the owner of javacraft which is already confirmed as hoax hosting ! and start merging with them and when we protest against you and alpha banned you ! You think you stand a chance ?
SidisLiveYT - If you think I am dumb , don't forget I made this thread because every premium users dm me about you , your hosting and scam you did with them ! If I am dumb then you are already abusing those paid users who paid g-host for hosting
SidisLiveYT - Btw you told infront of us you were in 10 hosting companies and look what i found ! Don't make this a lie , Every staff there saw your boldness about that .  You still think anyone will believe you ? I have not proofs kiddo ? I told you we have far more than you can reach to disapprove them - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-18/1623994903-757110-lol-1.png

SidisLiveYT - You are already exposed with your fake and scam hosting so called JavaCraft , so kiddo get a better life other than scamming others !
MemeyGoDOP - Dude you are literaly full of lols you shited 10servers now again its you and its confirmed
SidisLiveYT - MemeyGoDOP Yeap ! even Dark and dchu saw it clearly mentioning about his 10 hosting experiences ! lol !!
dchu096 - good talk sid. I ban you skiddev for a reason. I already expected things will go bad and im trying to restore g host and it gots deleted. There's no such coincidence is there? I dont believe there will be such coincidence the server got deleted not by you! right after i ban you.
SidisLiveYT - dchu096 Thanks bro ! Btw didn't he told about his 10 hosting experience ? infront of every staff in staff chat ?
dchu096 - Skie, just give up trust me. 1 cant fight against a whole team. Just admit you did this and i dont think discord will even be involved. If i were you i would just apologies and i will tell alpha and sid not to report you to discord. Being your account banned on discord isnt a fun thing to taste!

And hmm... he destoroyed 10 host?! oh well... Alpha made a bad move i guess. Hope alpha will learn the lesson.
SidisLiveYT - Skie , our kiddo , If you such a good guy why are you changing your name ! and why are you executive of a Hoax hosting (JavaCraft) !
Small Proof : What happens when you scam all the Customers and take their money and want to be isolated ! Skie Giveup , I came to destroy your Scam all over the Hosting Commmunity !

R6_ClapZ - bro we know you did it as its so coincidental that you BLOCKED me after the destruction of the server
SidisLiveYT - @Skie  I told you , Staffs never accepted your merging nor accepted the scam you did with Premium Users , Alpha told you re-brand but Premium Users should get what they paid for ! and you nuked whole Discord Server and changed nodes password ! You itself said to us ! and fun thing is every staff saw that ! How many staffs you want to approve my proof ? Kiddo you came to a wrong den !
KylePlays - Just a meme. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-18/1623999673-442318-image.png
dchu096 - oh really, so coincidence you even changed/deleted alpha's contabo username/pass uh?!



you think you can destory us like how you destory the other 10 servers?! maybe a bit too sad for you this time i guess, Wrong place mate! - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-18/1623999827-796874-image.png
KylePlays - dchu096 
Who me?
dchu096 - skie
KylePlays - dchu096 Ahh k k
SidisLiveYT - dchu096 Damn , Should we reveal the biggest proof of his hacking  ? , like what was the location when alpha got hacked and where these kiddo from 😀 ! @Skie , Do you think JavaCraft will be alive after this ? Do you think We will leave that hosting without exposing it completely from roots !!
SidisLiveYT - @Skie  ? Do I need to tell the Timezone what are you in ? You itself said to us ! All proofs are wrong ? all Staffs are wrong ? Nuke was false ? JavaCraft is not Exposed ?? 
For Final you think you stand a chance a bit ??
Alpha is leaving for studies and he can't access anything because of restrictions , thats why you were a temp owner , not a boss , who will just destroy whatever feels like ! huh , 
You copied some other's host name and you merging in the name re-brand !

Kiddo , Grow Up we are not like you - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-18/1624000472-89381-lol-7.png
Vignesh_x64 - Oh my got all these have happened i came to know just after the server got deleted??????
very bad
@Skie u very jealous of alpha and g-host
SidisLiveYT - Vignesh_x64 Damn Kiddo nowadays , knows nothing about hosting just scamming others and abusing nodes ! Destroyed a healthy community
dchu096 - SidisLiveYT yes you are right, a good community ruined by skidev. 😔
SidisLiveYT - What happened @Skie ! Why are you isolating ?? Fake , his account is not deleted ! And Second its true he is planning to host that Scam Hosting again ! Taking break to Scam again !


What next ?
Well making a alt and resume that hosting with his so called i9 nodes . 
And again Nuke the Server if everything falls down and Scam user's Money .
Ever heard of their plan ? 1 GB RAM with unlimited players , How in the world 1 GB ram can handle alot players ?? - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-18/1624004572-328579-lol-8.png

enricorichardo - SidisLiveYT ok like this my old hosting company is terohost.xyz taht almost open if u know but skie came to us and make a deal with us that ask us to merge with him as we have talk for a long time we came to an agreement 1. 100% arc 2. 50% of donation 3. full acsess 4. "I'll be offering 2.8k for cortex and quack host." -skie

SidisLiveYT - enricorichardo Bro First he was representing JavaCraft and he himself admitted it infront of all 6 staffs and second I am complaing about JavaCraft and Skie , I didn't mentioned about you !
SidisLiveYT - enricorichardo He and his hosting scheme should be banned ! He really did alot damage and you are too late to defend a kiddo who doesn't know when to stop be foolish !
dchu096 - was speaking with alpha through email. @Skie do you even know how alpha even thinks when i tell him you wrecked it?

have you even care about other people's fellings?





Begging me for refund is that the ending you want to see?

or looking when everyone start putting on my node until it starts overloading cuz alpha cant care about it??

I dont understand why you need to destory g host. A lv3 community is great as is whats the reason to destory us? - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-18/1624006583-704308-image.png

SidisLiveYT - And Most important you are forgetting , me and staffs are concerned about the money paid users give , he had to refund what he took and give compensation for the nuke he did on level 3 G-Host Server ! He literally changed the node's password and hacked owner's account and all proofs have been uploaded and it is not stopped , then alpha will take serious action upon JavaCraft and Skie Dev in Cyber Association ! 

Tell that kiddo , You are in a Wrong Den to Mess with adults
enricorichardo - SidisLiveYT im here to not defend him at all im  here just to tell you guys to not bring my name here and i will not continue javacraft i will continue terohost that being made by me and rj 
why i say that you guys bring my name cuz someone tell me this link and u guys take screen shot with my name i dont want to post anything and @Skie we decline your offer ty
SidisLiveYT - enricorichardo we just gave the screenshot and mention about his deleted account bro ! We are not attacking anyone we want ! read the post if you can ! We just hate JavaCraft and @Skie  and I guess seeing your reply , you know why !
SidisLiveYT - Update

Legendary - 👍️
SidisLiveYT - Their Javacraft.best domain and website are still active though !!
Skie - I didn't hack anything. I'll be bringing down the website and in a few hours. I was fixing issues in g host and the staff team didn't like it. That is not the problem. You guys though I was. "Hacking" discords. Which is false. Cause at the time I was not on my PC. I'll show a screanshot of that. I did change the node passwords // contabo account login. You got me here. Hye Hosting is not a scam I personality use them for n-vps which they have a i9-9900k proccesor. I am sorry for my actions and you may email at pvpingmcdiscord@gmail.com. i didn't rekt it you guys just dont like the choices that i was bringing to the table and you need to remove Javacraft name from this. Thanks
Skie - And plus Snowy and Bomb didn't scam anyone. We had really top-notch nodes that Hexit couldnt even get.
Skie - dchu096 The reason you though i destroyed it was I going through and changing everything which was for the good.
Skie - SidisLiveYT i
I'll refund all the users my self if you send me there plans and stuff.
Skie - SidisLiveYT. You all came attacting me in the first place when i was changing the name and you didn't belive alpha gave me perms and shit.
Skie - SidisLiveYT I won't give up cause ill protect what I belive in.
Skie - SidisLiveYT No i am not going to make a alt. I de-activated my account.
Skie - SidisLiveYT I didn't copy and one others host name. I purchased this domain on October 22, 2020. Which means i didn't and i am the proccess of copyrighting the other javacraft host.
Skie - SidisLiveYT I didn't hack alpha and at the time I was outside swimming. Do you want startup logs of my pc or what. Cause I now for a fact i didn't hack alpha.
Skie - dchu096 I didn't nuke anything I re-installed everything.
Skie - You all got nothing to say huh?
ThinusDL - Skie You said you'll refund premuim users so do it
ThinusDL - Skie Also you freaking added a nuke thing!

HarshLmao - Skie=
"I fear no man
But that thing (insert sid's picture)
That scares me"
Skie - You don't even know how to right a sentence right. Shut the fuck the fuck up. You haven't exposed me 20 times so stop lying and Alpha will have to send me all invoices.
Skie - Skid just fucking thinks he is the damn best person out there when he is trying to gain rep when I throwing his proof back into his face. His large month should fucking shut up and he is like 12 and doesn't even now how to right a sentence. He needs to shove a dick in his mouth and shut up.
Skie - If he can't right a damn sentence he shouldn't be on drama.gg lmao
HarshLmao - Looking at his sentences I honestly think this guy is some salty 7 year old with his momma's credit card in his hand. Come-on man like admit what you just did. You ain't gonna get nothing out of scamming people for money.
HarshLmao - And for him "write" became "right" 😂
Skie - I didn't receive one single payment would you like PayPal screanshots of all the payments? Cause they a were sent to Alpha not me.
SidisLiveYT - Skie First ! You announced your account deleted , hacked alpha and closed his account and you know very well alpha can't come right now because of his studies ( hostel ) , and you were made temp owner for that reason ! lol I gave all the proof and you are boasting sentences that doesn't make any sense so ! Yeah fuck off
SidisLiveYT - Skie Damn , Kiddo , Chill , javaCraft is gone and your hopes too ,
SidisLiveYT - Skie calling me Skid , hmm you are telling me I shouldn't be at drama.gg !
SidisLiveYT - We did it already ! Your IP logged  in alpha's account has been submitted on forum ! and they did confirmed about you so ! hmmmmmm....  and yes your hosting will be targetted by them so yeah lets hope for better for you ! You are too late even its not on my hands anymore lol .

SidisLiveYT - Now shove your little bug between your moma's legs Imao 😁
Skie - Lmao if you got my ip than what it is my ip.
SidisLiveYT - Skie Why am I questioning the answer , if you are going to be doomed lol !
SidisLiveYT - Here no one supports you for a reason lol , all users and staffs are against you lol , even your server got deleted , kiddo got no shame ! Btw you know , only alpha and you were having the access of the nodes ! Password got changed you know ?? and you itself said just now , you destroyed 2 hosts bruh ! Who the fuck you are to serve yourself hero here ?? - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-19/1624086630-438940-capture.png
ThinusDL - Skie I did lol
SidisLiveYT - ThinusDL Told you waste of time , Kiddo got nothing to prove , just roaming around like a beggar and shouting with no sense lul
ThinusDL - Skie You neither lmao. Please learn how to spell w-r-i-t-e.
HarshLmao - Skie? More like toxic 6 year old rat
SidisLiveYT - 🤣  Damn ! Omg
Skie - Okay I am going to say this in the clearest manner. 

Alpha came to me asking for me to come on as management/owner.  So I said yes, because I was being nice and I saw a lot of growth in the community of G-Host. So I came on and I was doing a-lot updates, and the staff was okay with  it till I renamed it JavaCraft.best. They didn't believe I asked alpha but here's proof I did. (https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/855134737898012674/855824971422629949/unknown.png) Than they were asking about all the paid customers etc. But all the paid customers went through Alpha and I need alpha to send me the invoices etc. But than they accused me of "Hacking" alpha's account which is false, cause I wasn't even on my pc at the time, and I'll show windows 10 logs.  That is my whole side of the story, If you need more proof, i'll show more proof.
Skie - @SidisLiveYT  Plus the next time you call me a kiddo you will not like what I will do.
SidisLiveYT - Skie You Damn Kiddo ? Listen First he meant re-brand , not merge , he even warned you , so shut the hell up your fucking meaning and second what you are thinking about windows logs ? Are you kidding me or what ?? You fucking noob changed passwords , nuked discord Server , Whom you are threathening ? We fucked up your so called Java Craft ? Told you Go suck your moma's balls 🤣
SidisLiveYT - Skie We already ruined your balls to death , even lead you to isolate , Who are you ? No one believes that fucking lie ? Who are you ?
SidisLiveYT - Do you think How much happy was those Users where when we destroyed you ? Reputation ? We loved that smile on them ! Told you ! You are too late to say something ! Bye 🤣
Skie - LMAO, your fucking funny. Sure just wait till next month with 800$ worth of ads will be purchased on my new host.
SidisLiveYT - Skie Then be ready ! Thanks for telling though ! hehehe ! See yaa 🤣
dchu096 - Skie Thanks for telling, now lets wait and see!
HarshLmao - SidisLiveYT you surely wont make a kid cry,his momma gonna be upset

SidisLiveYT - HarshLmao Sooo , True , I never realized , about his small fanbase ! 🤣
ThinusDL - Skie You didn't even follow his one condition and what about the server logs of G-host where you added the nuker thing. Stop playing victim and tell the full story. What happened to the nodes? What went wrong with the rebranding?
SidisLiveYT - ThinusDL 🤣  Kiddo got ambused by some Customers I think so ! Even Drama.gg Poll is against him ! Only 1 vote for him 🤣 ( Doubt his alt. ) !!
dchu096 - nice, still making hosting ei? you never learn skie...
