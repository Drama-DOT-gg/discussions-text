Spasboy - So I was contacted by my advertising manager with a partnership opportunity from a "new" hosting company. So I asked him to make a discord group and the partner manager said this
At this point I thought it was a decent host as they gave me an offer and rejected mine which made sense as it is expensive to fund. I then later get told he may wanna do a discount deal but this is where he gets a bit unprofessional 
Then he starts saying making fun of my twitch stats. By saying things like it is almost nothing and hardly anything (don't view streamers by there stats btw). 

Before this i was told it was a "new" Host which i later found out it wasnt and it was a mistake on my socials manager who later appologised a lot. 

This is where he becomes rude and really Unprofessional.

also i looked into his hosting company and found that another user who bought from them had experienced a bad manager aswell. and they passed it off. https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/argonhosting.net - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-04-27/1651041691-284499-screenshot-20220426-222008-discord.jpg

Tomas - pretty sure that's the owner
Spasboy - Tomas oh damn thats even worse
SnipezzV1 - ok that's not the most ideal staff behaviour... honestly they dropped down horrendous by calling you cocky. I mean what do you expect from a small streamer?
Win - bro he has the best hardwares any Minecraft server can ask for
Timanttikuutio - Spasboy 1.5k IS nothing, at least when you're talking about advertising. trust me, i know
Spasboy - Timanttikuutio i get that but its unproffesional to just say (U have nothing) All other hosting companies dont do that. they say it in a more formal way
Spasboy - Win he may do but he is very unproffesional
FlyingMane - Look you were acting all cocky trying to get a 64 gb server for basically free. Never did i insult you or say your content is trash or mis talk about your community. But if you expect me to give you a 64 gigabyte VPS you are very wrong. Not to mention that 1.5k is nothing on twitch, when i was streaming for my 2012 computer with 400p and 20 fps i got 3k in 2 months. 
Please show me the un- professionalism, or is stating the facts now considered unprofessional?
FlyingMane - Spasboy about the trust pilot review. We pretty much wrote an essay explaining how it's bogus and biased, i suggest reading that review, since the manager wasn't working for the company but it was the reviewer's personal beef with the manager
FlyingMane - Re reading the chats 
The only "mean", think i said was that you are cocky and Jesus you are, you need to understand that if you average 10 viewers per stream you aren't gonna make back 64 gigs in the foreseeable future. That's just simple mathematics mate
FlyingMane - Win tbh i have good hardware. 
A 5950 or a Ryzen 3800 are good CPUs, and none of my client's servers have ever had issues regarding bugs/issues on their servers in terms of resources
Spasboy - FlyingMane never once in the messages did I ask for a free server
Spasboy - FlyingMane like I said I said some kinda discount. I currently get 32gb free. I thought maybe another host may get me some more and I would have to pay like a discount as that's how other hosts operate.
FlyingMane - Spasboy 
You just asked me how much ram i could give you for free - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-04-28/1651126735-108938-img-20220428-081819.jpg
Spasboy - FlyingMane no I said if u could match the price then I would go with u
FlyingMane - Spasboy you didn word it that way
Robert - Next to these beautiful websites which definitely don't want me to throw up (see attachments)




their $1/gb plan has a Ryzen 9 5950x or a Ryzen 9 3900 pro (which would not be profitable unless they oversold to hell and back), and their premium $2/gb plans have a Ryzen 9 5950x or a Ryzen 7 3800x? That does not make any sense.




Also, apparently, their 3GB "premium" plan is free?



But yeah I would personally just go with a more reputable hosting provider at this point, all these new "[insert something here]Nodes" or "[insert something here]Host" hosting providers aren't really trustworthy imo and if you want to buy something from one, pay extra attention to stuff like this. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-04-28/1651135324-801318-image.png

Robert - Oh and forgot to mention, the "premium" plans also only have a 500mbps uplink and the "budget" ones have a 1gbps uplink?
Chirag - Spasboy 1.5k is honestly nothing at all
FlyingMane - Robert the free plan is for testing and no, the Ryzen 9s are not in the 1 gb plan. Also we have kinda never had issues with customers so i fail to see you point yet again rob
Robert - FlyingMane Well, if your budget plans don't have Ryzen 9's, why do you say that they do on the page? It's really misleading.
FlyingMane - Also, this thread is about me being unprofessional. 
I just said the facts like i saw them. It's not to determine if my website is up to Rob's standards or if my plans are being oversold or not
FlyingMane - Robert honestly i didn't notice it before, will fix asap
Robert - FlyingMane Well then I will just rename the thread, no problem, since these are genuine concerns and these are not "my standards", this is actual feedback you should take since I am most likely not the only one thinking this stuff and it makes your business look bad.
FlyingMane - Robert i did take feedback about the misleading info, that is something i will fix. 
For the rest, we are still remaking the whmcs and are actually working on a new theme so all the other concerns will be solved in a week or less
FlyingMane - FlyingMane i literally bought the antler template a day ago because the theme looks like dog ass
SnipezzV1 - Chirag Let me tell you something... It doesn't matter if a content creator has 1.5k followers or up to 1.5m. All comes down to the quality of the content he uploads online.
SnipezzV1 - He may not have that many followers, but he creates the best possible content that he possibly can. And that is the difference between small and successful.
SnipezzV1 - I'm not tryna say he's extremely successful, but considering he has a nice network and is partnered... it really makes a difference.
Chirag - SnipezzV1 no shit it doesn't
FlyingMane - SnipezzV1 he has no network and the hardware he partnered with is pretty shitty
Loser - Why make a server hosting provider if you can't run it right?
Arkhan - Hi, Im german and I checked that reviews. Now no joke i fall of my chair and hurt myself while seing someones name was Lukas Beste and had only one review. Lukas is a popular name in german and beste means best. Technically in germany there are almost no people with beste as last name. So its impossible that out of these rare people on commented only on this hosters page. Except the 1 start review all reviews are fake. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-04-29/1651264675-652611-image.png
FlyingMane - Arkhan well, nothing i can do, you can ask that guy himself, i think i have his discord
FlyingMane - Loser wdym? The only thing i didn't set up right is the whmvs lol. And that is because the website "sucks".
TheAlex - This is a useless thread so this is going to be my last reply on here, you make out of this what you want, i don't care about this toxic place enough to spend my nerves checking this thread. 
The original thread was made because BooHoo i said that 1.5k on twitch is nothing to a cocky man that thought he was worth a free 64 gb node. 
Never did i insult him or use offensive language while talking to him

Are my nodes over allocated? no, absolutely now. If anything, we are under selling, that is why i was looking for partners to help me get customers.


Node 1 


Node 2 


Node 3 

Is our WHMCS Backdoored? No, if you need to have proof i will send you the proof once i dig it out of my emails

Do i abuse hetzner? 
No, I don't. I have always hated plex for doing it and i also have the receipts if you need them. 

Do i have a tos and a pp? Yes, i do, although tthey are old and need to be updated, they are practical and still valid, and i am almost 1 month away from opening an actual LLC.

Do i have botter reviews? 
No, why would i need to? The 1 review accoutns you see are the customers i asked to review the service. Of course not everyone uses TrustPilot, so they only have 1 review. Even my staff has reviews on it because at some point they did end up purchasing a server. 


Why do i have premium specs on my budget plans? 
Simply put, the budget servers are being uploaded on the premium nodes and if you are a customer purchasing with us at argon, that is the first tyhing you will hear. That is because i haven't had the time to deploy my contabo nodes. So no, i am not lying when i say i am using premium hardware for the budget plan. Granted, that isn't gonna be forever

Now, a last bit of advice. 
I understand hating on plex, i mean he is a piece of shit, he deserves the worst. But when you try to drama,gg someone who has been in here since October, please find something i can actually fix and not criticism like "Website Ugly!!!"
Also also, i have a section in my discord that is directed toward drama.gg members, stating that i am open to free constructyive criticism and that if you find something that can be fixed, we will at least look into it and if it is a seriopus issue we will fix it. 

Wish you guys the best

FlyingMane - TheAlex correction from mobile: one hardware (the Canada one) on the budget nodes is wrong, will change once i get home
