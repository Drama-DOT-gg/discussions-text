babyharpseal - Today I came up with a hosting that advertised on my Discord (or well, tried). 

Then I asked why advertising on other servers and they deleted my messages. Later on, I found out they're using AWS for both of their nodes:
IN1:

In2:


They also use AWS nodes for everything, including panel, dashboard and such.
They're also using a Freenom Domain, https://tabhost.ml . Here are their links:
Dash: https://client.tabhost.ml/
Panel: https://panel.tabhost.ml/
Discord: https://discord.gg/WUYquNa4

I know their ToS and Privacy Policy is in the works because if you go to #information on their discord, you'll see it says soon. They don't even have a site yet and they're already operating illegally. They also do random wipes which make me believe it's when their trial ends and they have to create another node?

I sadly couldn't create a server to check what egg they were using, as their nodes were full already, and if it was a multi-egg to blacklist them, but I've created a ticket some hours ago to ask for invoices whatsoever they didn't reply yet. I'll keep you all updated. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-03-03/1646328493-998071-screenshot-2022-03-03-14-58-53-36-572064f74bd5f9fa804b05334aa4f912.jpg

babyharpseal - They're still deleting my messages on general chat about their aws nodes and they still have not replied to my ticket.
babyharpseal - babyharpseal ah yes, very much professionalism? - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-03-04/1646379329-438414-screenshot-2022-03-04-08-33-54-66-572064f74bd5f9fa804b05334aa4f912.jpg
