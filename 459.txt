NightWished - Social404 is one of the owners of numerous community server's and scam server's, as the plot goes he "paid" people in return for them inviting people to his server (invite rewards). After I exposed him in his server I was banned. The scam worked by making members invite their friends, reaching a certain invite count, claiming your money and then recieving a screenshot saying it's been paid to your Paypal email. He would then say that the Payments take 2-3 days to arrive and give you vouch perms aswell as a claimed role. The payment would not arrive and if you did ask when it would arrive, you'd get banned. Along with another person Reda who scammed people with invite rewards like nitro, Robux, and more.

Just thought I'd put this out there. There are probably many invite server's exactly like this one, however, the dudes that run this have a community reputation as they own a community server.
