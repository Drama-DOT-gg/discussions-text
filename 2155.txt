PadowYT2 - Basically this is based on this thread.

Starting from when Wajfay decided to redistribute the addon. Exactly I don't know what happend to him in the winter, got 0 info. Anyways I've been spying on his hosting for about 1 month. He had 2 hostings, ShieldCore &amp; FlexNodes (they also had .eu).

About ShieldCore
Of course they were using our leaked theme and leaked WHMCS (proof of using WHMCS (best I got)), anyways they moved on from using leaked stuff to Jexactyl. It was renamed to InfinityCloud due to copyright issues and sold to Dr. Adri (Discord ID - 421700777787260938)

About FlexNodes
They were claiming I was a scammer on their Discord server

Then so uh they made a Discord gc (transcript (I didn't show everything there, just the important stuff)). After like so many days

then

then


About himself in total
Don't know what he is on to currently as I see no activity/using leaked stuff. Basically he is a pain in the ass. Don't know what to add

wajfay - It seems that your company works very well as long as it is stable enough that when you enter it, it crashes, and then it's your fault, brother, use contabo.com or the OVH machine, which costs 150 dinars from the Chinese.

I said a million times not to buy Chinese machines
