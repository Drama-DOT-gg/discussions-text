FlyingMane - So since @FlyawayBear Bought the badsk.com domain i think it is a good idea to turn that website into every proof against badsk/plexed. Anything that regards his deeds, scam scheme, proof, screenshots, old way back machine archives, everything

Please help us, either post screenshots of him doing his scam or just incriminating pictures/links

Discord: https://discord.gg/g3puhcT8 

Please help, thanks 

We can use this website to show new users that use his hosts what he really is to avoid them getting scammed and him getting more money. It is a useful project
FlyawayBear - Uh it got gifted to me but yea basically that.
Jen - I still own the domain
