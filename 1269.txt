TTEG_Unbox - Hello friends,
I am the Founder And COO of CygenNodes and I recently came across this Host called Thunder Host which was called FS Hosting earlier. Its CEO Aryan was a staff in my host earlier and then he made his own host. I am happy for him but it is not right to just steal a company's TOS and/or PP.
Proof is given below:






I would request the owner to make a statement and apologise in their discord server publicly.

Oliver1234dotdot - Lmaaoo, ALPHA.. First of all you bought a VPS from me, you have LITERALLY NO linux experience, you shouldnt be running a host!
Oliver1234dotdot - Now second of all, why steal a TOS? It's legit easy to make, gtfo dudes
Somanjitjs - Ayo Aryan, I am the creator of the site ( cygennodes.com ), I made it with all due respect to the efforts that TTEG and other staffs are putting onto CygenNodes and don't you ever dare next time, to COPY SOMETHING ILLEGALLY FROM MY WORK!
AllSafe - Hello Founder &amp; COO of CygenNodes,

I am sorry for your losses due to someone copy your Terms or Service and Privacy Policy. However, copying terms of service and privacy policy isn't illegal at all, therefore you couldn't take any legal action on him (including DMCA). I also spotted changes on the terms of service which they changed your company name to their company name and he know what he is doing, this is definitely a valid terms of service. The point of terms of service is provide service and trust to your customer, not about fighting who copy your terms of service. You should be happy of someone copy your terms of service, it's a sign that you are an example that he like.

But I am aware of the motion of this thread is trying to asking someone to apologies for nothing wrong on him and his company, I could tell you wanted him to mention( or advertise) your host in their statement and do unnecessary apologies. You also mentioned that he was your staff and you are happy for him of starting out his own host, now you are being a hypocrite and fighting over terms of service and privacy policy. At this point, I feel very sad about him for being your staff and helping you. Your ungratefulness show how childish you are and the ugly part of your company, CygenNodes.com. 

Best wishes,
AllSafe
Rockerz - So as cygen nodes old member i am not commenting that aryan made a hosting and we are mad about it but its not legal just to steal other company's term of services without even asking the company and cygen wants justice and about the host first you need to have coding experience of be a owner of host and that you can setup dashdactyle  or peteo panel and if I talk abot the premium plans you don't even have a seperate node for premium customers so what is the priority of premium I better just use the free plan bruh and if you don't apologize to us we will take on furthur action so be prepaired
TTEG_Unbox - AllSafe So you mean to say that according to you if someone copies your legal documents which you made yourself then its fine? Now imagine this: you Work on a project very hard. You research, think and make that yourself and then suddenly someone just copies that project and gets good marks for it and people appreciate that fellow who copied your hard work. So how will you feel that time?
Wow look who is a hypocrite now.
And correction is Aryan doe snot own that host. He is staff there.
TTEG_Unbox - Update: Now they copied our Privacy Policy as well
Kowone - TTEG_Unbox idk if they're lazy or just a bunch of dumbfucks copying others stuff
AllSafe - Hello Rockerz &amp; TTEG,

Please state out how it's illegal and what action you will be carry out. Coding experience is not a must, it's just an extra talent to run a company but grammar and spelling is a definitely needed when communicating.

Unfortunately TTEG, I feel sorry for your lost since you doesn't have any protection over your document and I can't think of any law to protect your document, please specify it.

I have done some research on CygenNodes and I couldn't find it's an registered company, I would like to request for your company number and address.

Best Regards,
AllSafe
Kowone - AllSafe hmm, you're making a shit show host?
Rockerz - AllSafe 
So I Know that you think that we are accusing then just because aryan left cygen and that is a wrong thought 
We are just taking action because while we made out term of condition and privacy policy we did a lot of research and hard work to make our legal documents so our user can easily understand it and they just copied it without any effort imagin it like this you are in a class with many students and teacher gave everyone same homework and you put your best and made a very nice project and then your class mate just copied it and good as good marks as you , will you be mad or not because you have put you time and energy on your project and you class made didn't put any

And let me correct you once more you said that they have copied our documents and did some changes like change the name of the host to there 
But its the same thing as that your classmate copied your project and wrote his name in the front 
Name change is just a obvious change what do you think they will put our names host in the document sorry i ment to say there copied document  lameo 
That what i wanted to say 
Thank you
NotEthan - AllSafe my friend do you not even know its illegal having someone else tos and pp 

....
Thats just basic knowledge my friend
AllSafe - Hello NotEthan and Rockerz,

You haven't answer my question, what action are you going to take? You couldn't provide me a law that could protect your terms of service and privacy policy.

Best Regards,
AllSafe

anything else idiot and if won't understand 
I am in process of making my own host and I am  Jr web developer I can copy each and every single bit of data from ur website and upload - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-08/1638949707-442710-image.png
Sky - AllSafe However, copying terms of service and privacy policy isn't illegal at all, therefore you couldn't take any legal action on him (including DMCA).

PLS- By law it is illegal, considering the fact that they ARE legal documents. Here, think about this, 

If you trademarked the name "AllSafe", and someone copied it and "is" using it, then you proceed to say 
this is trademarked, please change it. But they say no, because it isn't illegal to copy it and use it. 

Yet it is, its the same example here. Trademarks are LEGAL documents, same thing with Privacy Policy's and Terms of Service.

This is ALL on the Copyright Law. Please read online about anything law, before you come onto a thread and talk about it. As what you stated was mis-informative.
__SECRET__ - Somanjitjs damm bro awesome website üëçÔ∏è can tell by the efforts in web site it took 6+ hours to make but feels bad cuz a random mofo is copying it

stop using Grammarly to look professional here
 
and the way u are talking here just reminding you copyright claims exist and they can sue you for copying their content and making money from it.

They don't have to provide a company number and address for the sake of their online privacy if it is home hosted. 

AND- a hosting company doesn't need to be "REGISTERED". Having a registration is just protection. As @Sloth has said previously in another thread.
__SECRET__ - and stop making these kinds of fake shity host and defending people who are copying people's hard work or the end result will be drastic and horrific like what happened to badsk / plexed
__SECRET__ - Sky agrees
AllSafe - Hello SECRET &amp; Sky,

In the case of CygenNodes is not a company, CygenNodes's owner cannot trade using a external name nor going to court. The owner need to trade with his own legal name. If the copyright law make sense, the copyright is reserve to CygenNodes (which is non-existing company) therefore the "CEO" cannot take any legal action.

Best Regards,
AllSafe
TTEG_Unbox - The owners of Thunder Hosting have apologised to me and also have they made a public apology in their DC. Apparently they did not know that aryan had copied the tos and pp from us. They gave us credits as well. So ig this is resolved temporarily.
Soul - does this allsafe guy is even a part of their staff?
Sky - AllSafe 

CygenNodes's owner cannot trade using a external name

When you get trademark, it becomes a license. CygenNodes can get trademarked if they want too.

The owner need to trade with his own legal name

Not necessarily, you can trademark any name.. Because you'll have the licensing for it..
Sky - TTEG_Unbox 

Alright on that note,

a Moderator can temporarily close this thread.
TTEG_Unbox - Sky I agree
TTEG_Unbox - Soul looks like yes
AllSafe - Hello Sky &amp; CygenNodes,

Bet CygenNodes didn't register trademark at all, https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/trademark-fee-information I don't think you can afford $250-$500+ for a trademark. Trademark requires company to register, in that way CygenNodes are not eligible.

Best Regards,
AllSafe
Sky - AllSafe You just completely disregarded what I said.

CygenNodes can GET a trademark license if they want too. 
NOT, CygenNodes HAS a license.
AllSafe - Hello Sky,

They can't because they are not a registered company and they don't have such big sum of money.

Best Regards,
AllSafe
Sky - AllSafe How do you know that they don't have a big amount of money?
How do you know what their money situation is financially?

Its not up to YOU to decide if they do or not. 
Its also NOT YOUR BUSINESS to know these types of things.
Jxck_KV - AllSafe Can you like shut the fuck up with the "best regards" bullshit please ty üôÇ
AllSafe - Hello Sky,

If they have enough money, they won't be here talking nonsense and arguing, they would have filled a lawsuit or send a lawyer letter. But they are here, speaking nonsense which things they couldn't done, I would suggest them to keep dreaming.

Best Regards,
AllSafe
Jxck_KV - Do you know cringe you sound when trying to be formal? lmao
Sky - AllSafe Now I'm just FUCKING PISSED at this point.

Because during this thread, and other threads, YOU HAVE DEMANDED a lawsuit. Which lawsuits can end up to over 5 THOUSAND DOLLARS. WITHOUT LAWYERS. Which I can see then why no one can afford that. 

PLUS ONCE AGAIN WE HAVE TOLD YOU, COPYING A LEGAL DOCUMENTED ITEM IS FUCKING ILLEGAL, SO STOP TRYING TO THINK IT ISN'T.

And yes, they are HERE because they want to make a difference in the world by keeping everyone safe.
And again, YOU HAVE NO SAY ON WHAT THEIR FUCKING MONEY SITUATION IS.
AllSafe - Hello Sky,

If it's illegal, file a lawsuit then. The point is YOU CAN'T. You don't have the sum of money to register for trademark, registering a company and hiring a lawyer. If you think you can, do the following before you speak, make yourself entitled to the lawsuit. Showing your inability on forum is all you can do.

Best Regards,
AllSafe
Soul - AllSafe the same thing applies to you too when you where crying about defamation
AllSafe - Hello Soul,

That applies to you as well, unable to provide evidence, telling lies and what a shame. If you don't have any evidence, we sincerely suggest you to shut up, you are just creating chaos and sharing what is false. 

Best Regards,
AllSafe
Soul - AllSafe Do you have any evidence that you pay for your nodes? You are telling lies that you pay for the ridiculous amount azure costs.
Have anything to back it up?
Sky - AllSafe You know, I can't keep wasting my fucking time with you, we went from talking LEGAL stuff to TALKING MONEY SITUATIONS THAT YOU DONT NEED TO RUB YOUR FUCKING NOSE IN. 

Make myself entitled to a lawsuit? How? I don't have a law suit. IM JUST MAKING MY POINT ACROSS- Copying a fucking PP and a TOS is ILLEGAL.

You're SO FUCKING LUCKY I don't snap right now.
Soul - AllSafe Have you provided any evidence that the statements are false? No. Cause you cant, do you even own viethosting just making sure cause idk.
AllSafe - Hello Sky,

Even thought it's illegal, you cannot take any actions and that's how inability you are. 

Best Regards, 
AllSafe
Soul - AllSafe Even though your claimed "defamation" is illegal, you cannot take any actions that shows your inability.
      
  
  
  just reposting after fixing grammar mistakes
AllSafe - Hello Soul,

Bring this question back to you, do you able to provide any evidence? If no, this is a clear sign that you are making the whole thing up and even if you bring this to court, you are unable to fight without evidence.

Best Regards,
AllSafe
Soul - AllSafe Are you able to provide any evidence? If someone really payed for their nodes they would post their invoices after blurring sensitive info(yes this has happened before and the thread got resolved).
AllSafe - Hello Soul,

After knowing Lushnodes is not a company, we have given up the idea of suing this poor little kid. It's too cruel to end someone future like that, we sincerely hope that Shershah could grow up and speak facts, not just accusing without evidences.

Best Regards,
AllSafe
AllSafe - Hello Soul,

If you are accusing someone, you are the one should provide evidence, not us. If you think it's our responsibility, we suggest that you create a thread about Netflix using Azure free trials and we will provide invoices if Netflix did.

Best Regards,
AllSafe
Soul - AllSafe  No pls sue me over your 5$ arc revenue pls. What will you sue for defamation? First your company is not a legal entity
Second the alleged defamation has not caused you any financial harm as you are selling no products.
Third you have no money as you gotta step so low as to abuse azure.

Ichigo - AllSafe imagine i told you registering a company in the UK costs 1 pound
Soul - AllSafe You gotta prove the court that the alleged stated fact is indeed false.
AllSafe - Hello Soul,

As we mentioned before, we have give up the idea of suing anyone here, it's not like we are here to end someone future but to protect others.

Best Regards,
AllSafe
Soul - AllSafe But i gotta ask do you own viethosting cause like no one knows?
AllSafe - Hello Ichigo,

Even in that case, you still required big sum of money for the lawsuit and trademark registration.
