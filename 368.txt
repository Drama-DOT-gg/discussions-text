Someone put the database online for free:

-Tip
This database breach does not contain any personal password.
only personal email
Sloth - Yum It includes phone numbers?
Yum - no, emails
and forgot to mention ips
Sloth - Nope, it includes emails, IP addresses and phone numbers, phone numbers only for the ones who enabled SMS verification.
Yum - yeah, i just saw one as im scrolling.
if you dont want your data being breached again i recc https://client.falixnodes.net/profile/settings
Deleting your account.
Robert - Yum But how do you know for sure that that actually deletes your data? Knowing Falix it could also still be stored elsewhere. And, as you may have seen in the data breach, there were a lot of duplicates, heck, some people even had 4 rows in 1 table lol.
Toki0179 - Very pog now people can send my email to scammers.
