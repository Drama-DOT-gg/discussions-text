Rxwdy - This is a new host.
I normally have no issues with new hosting companies but if you resell the free google cloud trial and claiming to be a Google Cloud Employee (He is unable to spell 'Employee' too lmao) you are just begging for someone to make this post.

P4RADOX - How does google trial have 300gb ram??
Aaron_ - Rxwdy He claims to be using GCP but there's no proof he is using gcp. In-fact the host didn't even start yet. Lets wait till he makes the host public and we can all see the ip address of his vps.
Rxwdy - Aaron_ This does not 'bash' on his hosting.
This simply warns people to watch out for these kinda people.
He clearly is admitting to adding Paid Plans which makes his claim about GCP quite something.

True.
Rxwdy - Currently banned from this discord lmao.
GreenArrow99 - I don't understand with these people, like if they aren't doing anything wrong why are they trying to run?
everytime someone exposes something the hosts literally ban them instead of proving that he/she is wrong and they later on be like I didn't do anything wrong
