Akmal - @Hmm321 you idiot. when someone answerd your question and then they said. "of course i used AZURE/AWS/GCP" but you instanlly trusted they abused?

I used GCP only for my Test Panel. because i dont want destroy my VPS. about my PP?

here: - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-25/1640424187-248633-screenshot-2021-12-25-162158.png
TrinityIndonesia - Akmal If you guys still this is fake, just try buy it oh wait i forgot you all just too poor ☹️
Akmal - From this moment and today. Drama.GG about Ltsamune Hosting opened by @Hmm321  is 100% false accusation. because this guy @Hmm321  has no accurate evidence.

Thank you, 
Best regards, 
LtSamune Hosting CEO.
Hmm321 - Akmal when i flamed you about having no PP then you went and make it, which is good for you
Hmm321 - stated there
 1st line. Ip isnt permanent ( it will change every month ) 
 Oh i wonder why
Terms of sservice 1st line
1st line. If the node is down, no data will be given back. 
Is it because you dont know when your account will get suspended? - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-25/1640426693-644082-image.png
Hmm321 - At the end of the day you closed it down Dec 25 2021. After i accused you about it - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-25/1640426783-429490-image.png
Hmm321 - In conclusion : 
No false accusations were made, you did abuse them but closed it afterwards.
You made a Privacy Policy after we attacked you for not having one.
Akmal - If you have never bought an item but immediately gave an opinion or directly insulted the product. You mean you are a person who is very jealous of other people's business. if you buy the product and you try it then you can make it proof or something. but you never bought any product from LtSamune Hosting and nothing. and you immediately accuse with this thing. You are just a person who is busy because of covid-19 so you disturb other people's lives.

Thank you.
Hmm321 - You yourself admitted that youre using them. And the terms &amp; conditions of the basic ones match the scenario if youre using free trials &amp; abusing providers. 

I think its pretty clear there.
Ip will change every month
No data will be given back if the node is down ( aka suspended )

Hmm321 - i think its pretty clear now eh? @Akmal
FlyingMane - Guys i hate to be AllSafe but do we have actual proof? Apart from over allocating and privacy policy, which can be fixed in a day, i don't see anything wrong with this host
Hmm321 - FlyingMane look at the screenshots i sent
Hmm321 - @FlyingMane  and on the very top. He admitted that he is using abused providers
FlyingMane - Hmm321 what am I looking at? I just woke up and I'm retarded rn. 
Also merry Christmas
Hmm321 - @FlyingMane  and the what so called "mc hosting basic" has a tos of ip changing every month. I mean tell me what explains that other than abusing providers?
__SECRET__ - Akmal btich how high you are ???

every business need a fricking PP and TOS  dickhead
FlyingMane - Hmm321 
I stand corrected, sorry
Hmm321 - FlyingMane i also went on one of their customers minecraft server, and he did say that he bought the vps from LTSamune. And as stated above i checked their dns record and all of the IP's are Azure &amp; Gcp Ips
Hmm321 - to be exact 
2 azure and 1 gcp
__SECRET__ - Akmal u know we can just get the ip from our own of these nodes as you have given us remaining info?
__SECRET__ - Aplimmm hosting stuff is not company? Kid. First before bullying other ppl go learn shit first hosting is literly count a company. Oh i know why you think hosting is not company, maybe bc you are just a dumb ass kid who dosent know about anything and just using your mom credit card to buy stuff in game, sorry i apologise it kid.

he was right u have to learn English


and technically to make a company you need to register it as a trademark which cost like $500 in us ( idk )
and i are providing service to users online it will be called as a service provider and they also need a Privacy policy in order to keep their user's data safe - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-25/1640428759-153562-image.png
__SECRET__ - RobusOfficial 

they need a registered trademark inorder to start one tbh and they are a service provider but still they need a  privacy policy to server user and protect their data - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-22/1640168562-444857-image.png
__SECRET__ - Aplimmm 
mate PP is like your certificate of you providing service to user and you are legit and what is the problem in making a PP it takes like 6-7 hours ( if u really wanna make it good and different from others) - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-25/1640429096-786749-image.png
__SECRET__ - RobusOfficial oh and forgot to mention , from the middle towards the end of that message is a joke about his PP size (that prolly described him correctly), and from the beginning - mid i rly am serious

I used GCP only for my Test Panel. because i dont want destroy my VPS. about my PP?

tbh AWS/AZUER/GCP are expensive as hell and most of the startup doesn't use them.
__SECRET__ - Akmal here: 

dude if you have a website please upload it there too 
cuz not everyone uses discord thou can keep in both but the website is necessary. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-25/1640424187-248633-screenshot-2021-12-25-162158.png
pwned - __SECRET__ Discord invite? The others are expired.
Oliver1234dotdot - Akmal No matter if they care about it or not, you need to have a Privacy Policy, and a Terms of Service if you do not want users exploting your service.
__SECRET__ - pwned sorry i don't have it i didn't even joined their server
__SECRET__ - Oliver1234dotdot mate how u can expect idiots to understand these ethics and I bet that he will respond with 

"I wiLl JuSt BaN tHeM  "
RobusOfficial - @Akmal#387787 every human being that have a functioning brain would already that its a red flag for that IP Tidak Permanent &amp; ``Jika Node Down atau mati jangan berharap Data bisa kembali` [for our non indonesian readers, its basically stating that its not a permanent ip and if their node randomly went down, u wont get your data back from those node], how is that not fishy enough ?
