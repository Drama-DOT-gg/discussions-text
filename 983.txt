MrRin - Meet Asjad - A staff member I recruited a little bit ago when I was recruiting new staff members, he seemed like the best candidate at the time, now I just want to help other hosting or other clients to steer well aware from this asshole.

I received a few reports over his time being staff here at EpikHost, but nothing major up until today- Dm'ing other users about a new host that he started- After just a little looking, it's a sketchy host (No TOS, stolen PP)

Lets start with him dming other users:

Claming he has a 59$ VPS. You'll see why this is funny in a second:

Ah yes, a freenom (free site for getting domains) domain, ending in .tk yet he has the money to splurge on a $59 VPS? Something doesn't quite add up there but I digress.

I then confronted him about this:

He asked me what he should admit, you can see this in two ways. One- He's done multiple things, Two - He was confused

I sent him the screenshots and then he said this:



(It's literally in the screenshot I sent him??? )

How could "His severe bad" be auto corrected from anything else? Someone explain?

Trying to change the topic that he hosted giveaways for us?

He then went and created a group chat with the person who reported him to me.

If you guys want I'll try find the ticket logs with this person to show he never asked for the invite.

The person who reported him had an alt who he also dm'd. 



Now he changes the topic to something that happened not related to my host? Then says I thought you were my friend, another reason I believe he may have dm'd other users who haven't come forwards.

(That's what he was talking about with saying sorry or something)
The group chat starts to become irrelevant here but I can show other screenshots if need be.
I decided to go check out his site now to see if there's any other dirt, and Oh my lord, have I seen such a shithost in my life.

Threatened to expose my host for over allocation when I told them I was exposing there's??

Feel free to ask for anything else because I will provide.

MrRin - Meet Asjad - A staff member I recruited a little bit ago when I was recruiting new staff members, he seemed like the best candidate at the time, now I just want to help other hosting or other clients to steer well aware from this asshole.

I received a few reports over his time being staff here at EpikHost, but nothing major up until today- Dm'ing other users about a new host that he started- After just a little looking, it's a sketchy host (No TOS, stolen PP)

Lets start with him dming other users:

Claming he has a 59$ VPS. You'll see why this is funny in a second:

Ah yes, a freenom (free site for getting domains) domain, ending in .tk yet he has the money to splurge on a $59 VPS? Something doesn't quite add up there but I digress.

I then confronted him about this:

He asked me what he should admit, you can see this in two ways. One- He's done multiple things, Two - He was confused

I sent him the screenshots and then he said this:



(It's literally in the screenshot I sent him??? )

How could "His severe bad" be auto corrected from anything else? Someone explain?

Trying to change the topic that he hosted giveaways for us?

He then went and created a group chat with the person who reported him to me.

If you guys want I'll try find the ticket logs with this person to show he never asked for the invite.

The person who reported him had an alt who he also dm'd. 



Now he changes the topic to something that happened not related to my host? Then says I thought you were my friend, another reason I believe he may have dm'd other users who haven't come forwards.

(That's what he was talking about with saying sorry or something)
The group chat starts to become irrelevant here but I can show other screenshots if need be.
I decided to go check out his site now to see if there's any other dirt, and Oh my lord, have I seen such a shithost in my life.

No TOS / T&amp;S, miss spellings, Shittily made 

Clearly a template with the phone number etc not in use, random images for seemingly no necessary reason, Invalid hyper links, multiple links to the same thing?


404 on their docs page?

Shoddy English





Shoddy English and claims that aren't backed.


Again claims without proof and shoddy English, my trust in this host keeps falling and falling.


Infinite wheel showing the same things? That it's a dodgy host with two languages supported.

Lets start with him dming other users:

Claming he has a 59$ VPS. You'll see why this is funny in a second:

Ah yes, a freenom (free site for getting domains) domain, ending in .tk yet he has the money to splurge on a $59 VPS? Something doesn't quite add up there but I digress.

I then confronted him about this:

He asked me what he should admit, you can see this in two ways. One- He's done multiple things, Two - He was confused

I sent him the screenshots and then he said this:



(It's literally in the screenshot I sent him??? )

How could "His severe bad" be auto corrected from anything else? Someone explain?

Trying to change the topic that he hosted giveaways for us?

He then went and created a group chat with the person who reported him to me.

If you guys want I'll try find the ticket logs with this person to show he never asked for the invite.

The person who reported him had an alt who he also dm'd. 



Now he changes the topic to something that happened not related to my host? Then says I thought you were my friend, another reason I believe he may have dm'd other users who haven't come forwards.

(That's what he was talking about with saying sorry or something)
The group chat starts to become irrelevant here but I can show other screenshots if need be.
I decided to go check out his site now to see if there's any other dirt, and Oh my lord, have I seen such a shithost in my life.

Threatened to expose my host for over allocation when I told them I was exposing there's??

Feel free to ask for anything else because I will provide.

MrRin - Meet Asjad - A staff member I recruited a little bit ago when I was recruiting new staff members, he seemed like the best candidate at the time, now I just want to help other hosting or other clients to steer well aware from this asshole.

I received a few reports over his time being staff here at EpikHost, but nothing major up until today- Dm'ing other users about a new host that he started- After just a little looking, it's a sketchy host (No TOS, stolen PP)

Lets start with him dming other users:

Claming he has a 59$ VPS. You'll see why this is funny in a second:

Ah yes, a freenom (free site for getting domains) domain, ending in .tk yet he has the money to splurge on a $59 VPS? Something doesn't quite add up there but I digress.

I then confronted him about this:

He asked me what he should admit, you can see this in two ways. One- He's done multiple things, Two - He was confused

I sent him the screenshots and then he said this:



(It's literally in the screenshot I sent him??? )

How could "His severe bad" be auto corrected from anything else? Someone explain?

Trying to change the topic that he hosted giveaways for us?

He then went and created a group chat with the person who reported him to me.

If you guys want I'll try find the ticket logs with this person to show he never asked for the invite.

The person who reported him had an alt who he also dm'd. 



Now he changes the topic to something that happened not related to my host? Then says I thought you were my friend, another reason I believe he may have dm'd other users who haven't come forwards.

(That's what he was talking about with saying sorry or something)
The group chat starts to become irrelevant here but I can show other screenshots if need be.
I decided to go check out his site now to see if there's any other dirt, and Oh my lord, have I seen such a shithost in my life.

No TOS / T&amp;S, miss spellings, Shittily made 

Clearly a template with the phone number etc not in use, random images for seemingly no necessary reason, Invalid hyper links, multiple links to the same thing?


404 on their docs page?

Shoddy English





Shoddy English and claims that aren't backed.


Again claims without proof and shoddy English, my trust in this host keeps falling and falling.


Infinite wheel showing the same things? That it's a dodgy host with two languages supported.

Lets start with him dming other users:

Claming he has a 59$ VPS. You'll see why this is funny in a second:

Ah yes, a freenom (free site for getting domains) domain, ending in .tk yet he has the money to splurge on a $59 VPS? Something doesn't quite add up there but I digress.

I then confronted him about this:

He asked me what he should admit, you can see this in two ways. One- He's done multiple things, Two - He was confused

I sent him the screenshots and then he said this:



(It's literally in the screenshot I sent him??? )

How could "His severe bad" be auto corrected from anything else? Someone explain?

Trying to change the topic that he hosted giveaways for us?

He then went and created a group chat with the person who reported him to me.

If you guys want I'll try find the ticket logs with this person to show he never asked for the invite.

The person who reported him had an alt who he also dm'd. 



Now he changes the topic to something that happened not related to my host? Then says I thought you were my friend, another reason I believe he may have dm'd other users who haven't come forwards.

(That's what he was talking about with saying sorry or something)
The group chat starts to become irrelevant here but I can show other screenshots if need be.
I decided to go check out his site now to see if there's any other dirt, and Oh my lord, have I seen such a shithost in my life.

The creator of this thread, Mr rin and also my boss, owns a discord bot hosting company, Asjad tried to use his own host by advertising it to people who didn't have a clue he existed, once Rin confronted Asjad about this, he got blue balls and tried to shove shit as us in anyway possible

AyushBhatt10thbroll-no15 - yo guys see this threat!
AyushBhatt10thbroll-no15 - @TejasLamba kid wanna say something?
AssassiN - since epikhost drama is over, lets talk about this...

Welcome to my podcast! namely exposing rainbowstudio

 (if you think this is not related to hosting then just read the conclusion)

they're not just stealing clients and lying

apparently everyone in the rainbowstudios dev team is a fuckin skid

here, their github organization: https://github.com/TeamRainbowDevs

every single repo has &gt;10 commits which are mainly readme and updating package files. we can derive that its just download and upload repos, if you want just take a statement with uniquely defined variables from each of the repository and run it through github, you'll get a result back of the exact parent / forked repos WITH the unique var name, letter to letter.

alright now lets talk about tejas, which I had many experiences with, my beloved copy paster who copies every single fuckin project I make.

1 copied my discord bot without giving creds, even banned me for claiming the code.
he copied my discord bot without giving credits, banned me and the other developers from rainbowdev server because we were claiming the code. He even went as far as to selling "premium" version of his bot. I had to close source it for him to run without my updates 🤮



look at the folder named "opbot" (his bot) and admitting of running my code

^^ above image also proves that he doesnt know shit about coding
2 copied my afk page
he copied my afk page without giving creds ofc, claimed that "he made the afk page"

what a terrible way to make money, @TejasLamba if you wanna run a fuckin afk page then make sure to change the arc setup next time

I was making money from his afk page cuz his skiddin ass couldnt understand how to change the fuckin arc config

proof the site was mine: 



him admitting that the page was mine and that he doesnt care


lol making money from his afk page xD


I was gonna fill the dmca form but I didnt bothered cuz I made like 15$ off of his page 🙂

3 copied my npm package

my npm package has been used quite alot by the discord bot developers over  the past few months, ofc he will skid every successful project of mine right?



Conclusion

I think we all know that they are not capable of running their own host. After the "colorful" past with original developers they copied from (including me). I bet they dont even know the basic linux cmds, let alone running a fuckin host with free un-modified themes and freenom domains with absolutely no coding experience.

they are just 12yr old salty indian kids without any money, running their only server on digitalocean free creds.

ofc they dont care about how much hardwork the developers put into writing their own projects, they just copy the whole fuckin shit and claim ownership of it. They know nothing about coding / programming and are doing all this just to gain popularity imo

this is just funny


skid accusing a skid of skidding lmfao

And if you are a dev for rainbowstudios then dont even dare fuckin claiming that all of this isnt true, all proof is attached above.

AssassiN - since epikhost drama is over, lets talk about this...

Welcome to my podcast! namely exposing rainbowstudio

 (if you think this is not related to hosting then just read the conclusion)

they're not just stealing clients and lying

apparently everyone in the rainbowstudios dev team is a fuckin skid

here, their github organization: https://github.com/TeamRainbowDevs

every single repo has &gt;10 commits which are mainly readme and updating package files. we can derive that its just download and upload repos, if you want just take a statement with uniquely defined variables from each of the repository and run it through github, you'll get a result back of the exact parent / forked repos WITH the unique var name, letter to letter.

alright now lets talk about tejas, which I had many experiences with, my beloved copy paster who copies every single fuckin project I make.

1 copied my discord bot without giving creds, even banned me for claiming the code.
he copied my discord bot without giving credits, banned me and the other developers from rainbowdev server because we were claiming the code. He even went as far as to selling "premium" version of his bot. I had to close source it for him to run without my updates 🤮



look at the folder named "opbot" (his bot) and admitting of running my code

^^ above image also proves that he doesnt know shit about coding
2 copied my afk page
he copied my afk page without giving creds ofc, claimed that "he made the afk page"

what a terrible way to make money, @TejasLamba if you wanna run a fuckin afk page then make sure to change the arc setup next time

I was making money from his afk page cuz his skiddin ass couldnt understand how to change the fuckin arc config

proof the site was mine: 



him admitting that the page was mine and that he doesnt care


lol making money from his afk page xD


I was gonna fill the dmca form but I didnt bothered cuz I made like 15$ off of his page 🙂

3 copied my npm package

my npm package has been used quite alot by the discord bot developers over  the past few months, ofc he will skid every successful project of mine right?



Conclusion

I think we all know that they are not capable of running their own host. After the "colorful" past with original developers they copied from (including me). I bet they dont even know the basic linux cmds, let alone running a fuckin host with free un-modified themes and freenom domains with absolutely no coding experience.

they are just 12yr old salty indian kids without any money, running their only server on digitalocean free creds.

ofc they dont care about how much hardwork the developers put into writing their own projects, they just copy the whole fuckin shit and claim ownership of it. They know nothing about coding / programming and are doing all this just to gain popularity imo

AndreaMiele - @AssassiN 100% true
AssassiN - apparently he even distributed the src without my permission



tbh I dont care about it since its really old code and inefficient, the running code is way more professional, has 70% more features and sharded. Running in 1.8k servers. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-09-13/1631541770-775784-image.png
AssassiN - @TejasLamba ^^ anything you wanna explain? shitty indian motherfucker who lives off of his mother's prostitution money??
AssassiN - yeah skid copying code doesnt make you a code either, imagine copying MY code and then accusing me of copying your codes lmfao? I legit posted all the proof you need in the big post above. Read that hoe - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-09-13/1631542375-858666-image.png
AssassiN - lol asjad xD admitting he doesnt even know how to install teh fuckin panel and here he is RUNNING A FUCKIN HOST??!?!? - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-09-13/1631543294-730849-image.png

AndreaMiele - Lol
AgentHacker - Just Asking Why The Fuck am I being a part of this drama
I Just said few words because of being banned from epikhost for no reason and was blamed for Rate Limiting. 
So Pls I just dont want to be in this drama/situation!!!!!
AgentHacker - AyushBhatt10thbroll-no15 i am admin there because they are my friends and i am active and that doesnt mean i am included in this situtation!!!!
PolyAnthi - AgentHacker As part of the management team, I was the one who banned you. We are NOT taking risks from someone who is an admin in their server. Asjad could ask you at any minute. You will NOT be unbanned.
AgentHacker - PolyAnthi i never do some idiotic because i can easily be caught 
If I wanted to do the Stuff then i would've do it
AgentHacker - I Just wanted to host my bot second bot .
PolyAnthi - AgentHacker Welp. Sorry but you aren't being unbanned.
AgentHacker - I dont care but just dont include me in this fight thats all!!!!!
AgentHacker - I Dont even own it!!! - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-09-13/1631548334-461207-image.png
PolyAnthi - AgentHacker LMAO. You aren't getting unbanned anyway.
AssassiN - AgentHacker I'm the owner of Nugget Developement.

we are cutting all ties with rainbowstudios since they do nothing but skid codes

here: https://gist.github.com/Assassin-1234/8172a4e5f523f71b7f21ca204ef57b5a
full detail
AssassiN - AgentHacker if you want to appeal just dm the bot moderator.
PolyAnthi - AssassiN Ayo gimme admin in it. I'll join ur support discord ;p
Oliver1234dotdot - MrRin Actually not a bad idea to do, as it is a CDN the images will actually load faster than if it was placed in a assets folder on your website 😃
dchu096 - Oliver1234dotdot but you can drag and drop into drama.gg which i mean... have the preview
AgentHacker - epikhost staff irritating me even after i told him to stop it - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-09-14/1631606330-364571-image.png
MrRin - AgentHacker He isn't staff?
AyushBhatt10thbroll-no15 - @AgentHacker no?ur server staff rate limiting epikhost literally LMAO if I irritate u that's very small thing according to me your server people irritating more ba

hahahhahahah
AyushBhatt10thbroll-no15 - PolyAnthi so true yeah
Spoder - Why would you run a whole host without knowing a thing about coding or anything, imagine when your clients start having issues? Isnt that worthy of legal action from the clients side? False advertising or some shit idk, because YOU CANT RUN THE HOST!
AyushBhatt10thbroll-no15 - Spoder yessir @MrRin server is the best 😃
Trxppy - I terminated a partnership with his group not too long ago
he tried to raid my server and made up a bunch of lies

Trxppy - All of his claims were lies ofc. Never heard of anyone in that group.
Ascendus - Sounds like a bunch of primary school kids fighting over who's chair is who
Maxysk - funnily enough i used to staff @ a free host and Asjad didn’t even know how to host a simple js bot there even though it was practically self-installing, lmfao
Maxysk - also people frequently dm advertised him and he always responded with some form of discriminatory slur
CharityLexus - why did this get bumped after 8 months
Indeed - sorry for bumping but does anyone have a invite to this host or does it not exist anymore
