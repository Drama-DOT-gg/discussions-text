Mocab - Dubs Are you using a message logger?
Dubs - Mocab It's screenshots from someone else
Grabstop - Dubs Further information on this topic can be found here
Daftscientist - I don't see the issue here since Oreo offered to test someone's ddos protection... Isn't that good? Allowing someone the chance to test out their ddos protection. A lot of professional companies pay for people to try and break their systems and ddos etc...

If he was suggesting that he was ddosing the IP that is shown in the image of a terminal, that's not good but overall, I don't see the issue...

I may not have the full story but that's what I can see from this post.
Daftscientist - I have known Oreo for a while.
Loser - ._.
Gunner - if hes wanting to test out someones ddos protection WHILE asking its not bad and its also helping the other person get better protections  for ddos attacks as someone who learned from nothing to understanding my stuff about hosting i know whats good and bad  and as am currently working on somthing that i need to  make ddos protection is good and protected thats needed
Timanttikuutio - Gunner except you'll also need permission from the network owner of where the server is being hosted from and also where the attack is initiated from, both of which i bet are quite hard to get
