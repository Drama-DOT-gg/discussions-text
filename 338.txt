James - Just a disclaimer before you read this entire post: ⚠️ 

i use to own a host with TMKC / Pierre called navo hosting and I was forced to give him the host due to him supplying the node to keep it going so he owned the clients from navohosting.net

===========================================

Pierre owns a small reseller hosting provide that supply services like: vps, web hosting, ext.. called servertop.net and recently decided to take part in supplying a customer with a plan that is for 6 months on a Ryzen 7 3800x with x amount of ram and not within 14 days of the purchase (refund policy is 14 days due to being in Europe) and decides to message them going we are changing the plan to a Xeon core with x amount of HDD storage and expects the clients to be happy with migrating over to the services but the clients wasn't having any of the issues and decided to refund over 500 euros of damages due to them breaking there own tos (apparently but they had no tos or uap)

and I know the provider and he turns around to me and shows his PayPal in the minus amounts and goes "I'm gonna make another PayPal " because he refused to refund anyone because he didn't have the money and apparently wasn't his fault due to budget cuts (btw don't offer services to a client if you cant provide it for as long as they paid for) and says he is closing the host to avoid the drama from winter hoax and ext so he will be left alone..

(cant disclose who the partner is and evidential information because they wanted it hidden)
also his partner left midway because he learnt that:
TMKC was taking the income and didn't log any of it 
not paying for nodes
using nulled os (from resellers)
bad rep due to him scamming

You where never forced to give me anything. You could just as easly get a node of your own.  You gave me Navo simply because I already had a node.

*TMKC was taking the income and didn't log any of it
*not paying for nodes
*using nulled os (from resellers)
*bad rep due to him scamming

What do you mean "using nulled os"? How can it be nulled if I pay for it? Using a reseller does not mean it is nulled. This was at the time when you where running Navo, so you where fully aware of this as well. Don't even TRY to make me the only person to blame.

How do I scam people? It was not a scam, not even CLOSE. I let the customer know WAY in advance that the change had to happen with the "new" node.  I COULD have waited to after 14 days of payment and just be a dick that way, but I didn't. I let them know ASAP.

And also, please prove to me it is over 500 bucks we are talking about that you claim it is.

Can you prove that I stole money from streamers? And how do you know if I have cancer or not? I do not have to show you my medical records since they are concidered confidential.  No one except licensed doctors or the authorities can force them.  If I do not want to share it, I am not required to.

I imported the old customer data to the new system since you GAVE me the clients as you stated in your message.  Since it already was "my property", I imported it into the new system so that clients did not have to re-create the account and order the service once again.


Before you say anything, show the proper chat logs so it shows our communications and ALL the evidence showing that I scammed people.  You shared the image of my PayPal balance at -160-ish USD. That means that the clients got their money back.  If they got their money back, it is not a scam.
James - TMKC All i see here is you denying and making excuses id like to see some evidencial information regarding this is what i claim is false thank you
