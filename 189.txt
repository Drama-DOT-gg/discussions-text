EmeraldMike - Mmmm yes a classic story
PopSeaKal - I have some new information, I talked with the owner and it seams like the owner doesn't even get the license someone else gets it for them and the admin page shows license expired too. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-02-10/1612961166-59652-image.png

The other owner Pays as a part of the split we do, I pay for the servers and he pays for WHMCS I have contacted him and he is fixing the issue when he is home as the Money for WHMCS came out of his account
PopSeaKal - Nino There's no mention of another owner anywhere in your whole host other than when you say it yourself.
Nino - PopSeaKal He is in the Discord under the Name of Captain Ruby as Mentioned,

NeilGamingYT - @PopSeaKal Is just trying to destroy hosts, Aren't you?
Tomas - NeilGamingYT This forum is to make others aware of scummy hosts &amp; people.
Nino - Tomas Just like to make you awake this has now been paid it was due to a card issue with the Co-Owners Card https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/760933317964333080/809504079780249620/Screenshot_20210211_191751_com.android.chrome.jpg Proof found below

Nino - Tomas This was to make you aware that the statement you just made IE Scummy Hosts is not us, We are trying to get into the business we have a client whos is happy and are looking for more
onyx - Nino your definition of "getting into business" is using nulled whmcs? damn this really is a classic winterhoax
Tomas - Nino would've said it on any thread, he just happened to have said here - that's all
Nino - onyx We have never used a Nulled WHMCS
