Armic - Oceaned is a host that has about 750 members that has done lets just say bad things 

A staff manager of the server found a exploit where they could crypto mine on a NGINX server on pterodactyl then the owner proceeded to ask how they did it and said they were gonna do it on DBH (DanBot Hosting)

When asking If they copied other hosts they said "Have you heard of putting a knife to your wrist" They also tell people to kill themselves

Chirag - Armic A staff manager of the server found a exploit where they could crypto mine on a NGINX server on pterodactyl then the owner proceeded to ask how they did it and said they were gonna do it on DBH (DanBot Hosting) Then posted pictures of them abusing DBH

DBH is dogshit tbh
Armic - Chirag What does that have anything to do with the thread?
Armic - Woosh I would love to see proof of this
Armic - Woosh I mean I don't need to do anything your ruining your own rep
Armic - xeny Again I don't see how me using light mode is relevant to this thread
AVIXITY - xeny Your flamingo pfp opinion is invalid about lightmode , continue with the actual topic tho üôÇ
AVIXITY - Woosh From where could staff get 500 people? none cares enough to 'bot' the server , get your stuff right.
AVIXITY - xeny clap clap
Armic - Woosh Staff joining a server isn't botting last time i checked
AVIXITY - Woosh ay bubyy calm down , i mean we dbh staff ain't that low , so it's your opinion
J0SH - xeny you're a joke, get a life
AVIXITY - Woosh Calm  do someone care enough to join with 500 botted accs from dbh?
it's doing way better , doesn't need to do bad to be good , so rather than acting hard by saying whatever comes first , might wanna get your stuff right with actual proof or us doing anything , which wouldn't make sense getting if it ain't staffs foult.
AVIXITY - xeny i did haha
AVIXITY - xeny ???
AVIXITY - xeny stay on topic , or switch if you're scared
J0SH - xeny shittiest come back
AVIXITY - xeny well the main topic is this thread ain't about me , neither something i'm mentioned in 'bb'
J0SH - LMAO, the proof is the fact you keep calling people ni****, if you were half decent you would be acting professional if you were really trying to defend yourselves
xeny - AVIXITY ok bb
xeny - aight im off to play minecraft you guys continue arguing ty
AVIXITY - xeny feel free to run away , rep going üîΩ
Xcyth - Chirag 1. It has nothing to do with this thread
why? just because you were caught mining on it and got banned? 

i bet you do this to most hosts just because you are a no life kid who has nothing to do other than abusing hosts who try their best to help people
J0SH - try their best to help people ahahahaha most of them sell &amp; lose your data
Xcyth - J0SH lmao thats falix not dbh
Chirag - Xcyth wasn't that 4 months ago and it's your fault, I am/was allowed to legally mine on your servers since there is/was no tos stopping me from mining there + unlimited resources lmao?
Xcyth - Chirag just because it can be done doesnt mean it is allowed, this is why you should have gone to school and if you really wanna proceed this, contact me on discord Xcyth#0001
Armic - Chirag If you read the rules there is a no abusing rule and mining is abusing the host

Chirag - Armic rules != tos
DarkInk - https://imgur.com/a/8Ww1UHz They just nuked their chat XD
Armic - Chirag are you dumb
Chirag - Armic I'm not you.
Armic - Chirag very good comeback m8
babyharpseal - @Armic it's not that hard, no ToS = no hosting rules, which means users can do whatever they want, lmao
Armic - Update 
I talked with one of the owners and they said they werent mining on DBH and said they were mining on their own servers but when checking their panel account we found a python server which was used for mining

Them saying they abused their own servers which was a lie:

The server and proof of them owning the server:

Person mining on the server was:  "! ! ! ! igna#6969" (852696995881025566)
Armic - babyharpseal We do have a ToS if you checked the rules channel
https://imgur.com/a/iGue5kr
babyharpseal - Still, not a valid ToS tho
Woosh - stop crying you legit told 14 people to kys in your server compared to 5
J0SH - Just going to remind you, this thread is about YOU, no one else; YOU.
Armic - Woosh this thread isn't about DBH but if your going to talk about it il answer
Everytime "kys" has been said in DBH was talking to close friends and they knew they were joking but in your server it has been said to a random member 
proof: 
https://imgur.com/a/xuV8yEN
Woosh - stfu
J0SH - Armic Just gonna point out, how did you know they knew you were just joking?
Armic - J0SH we say it to each other ( as a joke ) we both know their jokes and are good friends, if they were offended or thougth it was serious action would be taken against me ( mute, ban etc) also the person i have said it too is a admin and could have taken action if he felt offended
Armic - AVIXITY Don't be rude he asked a simple question
AVIXITY - Armic no worries.
z_t0ht - love this thread üòÅ
Armic - Sliden Can you not post useless stuff its not relevant to the conversation at all
Sliden - Armic tits
J0SH - @AVIXITY I saw your post on the discord, you don't have to tell people you're offended to be offended...

Some people may have underlying mental health issues and that shit doesn't help, although they may know you don't mean it, it sometimes still affects people.
Armic - Also a staff manager in oceaned.host contacted me yesterday and said this: 
https://imgur.com/a/fvLFLNv
https://imgur.com/a/X82WoUT
Even a staff manager in there says the host is bad that has to say something.
z_t0ht - babyharpseal don't get involved into this
Armic - J0SH I agree but me and the person are good friends and if they were offended they would have told me. If you have more questions you can ask me here or dm me on discord: Armic#0001
J0SH - We may not have real evidence to prove the accusations, the evidence is the fact you guys keep sending disgusting messages to people. "slit your wrists", " have you heard of putting a knift to your wrist". who the fuck says that? I would have a criminal record if I said that repeatedly to a kid in school. You're gonna wake up one day and someone's gonna be dead because of what you say.
Armic - J0SH Also we do have real proof of them abusing the host if that is what your talking about (scroll up and find where i said update)
J0SH - It doesn't matter if they've been abusing the host, they shouldn't be allowed on the internet whatsoever.
J0SH - They're worse than badsk.
z_t0ht - J0SH who are you replying that to?
J0SH - Oceanedhost owners
Woosh - J0SH have you seen half of every gaming community
qoft - lmao what
IoNetty - This legit has problems, you told people to kill themselves, wtf? I don't like starting drama but why?
J0SH - Woosh Yeah I have, and you're not welcome in the hosting community.
J0SH - You guys are probably some toxic ass 12-year-olds looking for a get rich quick scheme
z_t0ht - ü§£
z_t0ht - ü§£
Woosh - J0SH ah yes, free hosting = get rich quick scheme
Xcyth - so are we gonna do nothing about this? also, they posted nudes of a minor in their announcements page, i would get proof but they banned me so....
Environment - Can confirm, these people are really dumb and have said dumb things.
Deleted User - FROM THE OTHER POST OF FLOPPA.LOL:
Hello there, I‚Äôm JAMAL, an independent advisor!
Hey people from the drama.gg! I can confirm that this floppa.lol / oceaned.host is running so much illegal stuff.

They have been trying to raid the DBH server (they paid some guy that sells tokens to do it ), they botted their boosts and they are violating the discord terms of service in any way. TWITTER, GO CANCEL THEM! #EXPOSED #OCEANEDHOSTEXPOSE #EXTREMEDRAMA

Solo - why.... just why.
Ricky - HI, Ricky here. I've noticed the drama that's been going around here, and if one of you  with knowledge could please DM me with some insight, that would be great. I'd be able to post the situation in a channel.
