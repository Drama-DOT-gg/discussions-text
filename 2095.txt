GreenOfficial - dont care, mysticalnodes deserves it
Timanttikuutio - GreenOfficial alright then kid. since you seem to be taking the piss, why dont we go and report tikhosting.ro's all ip addresses to the fivem devs for breaking their tos(you're not allowed to resell fivem hosting)

would be kinda funny, wouldn't it ðŸ˜‰
GreenOfficial - Timanttikuutio sure you can report tichosting, im not with them, im just saying it being mysticaldoggo is a piece of shit accusing people of stuff.
Timanttikuutio - GreenOfficial tbf i've never even heard of either of them, so i couldn't really care any less, just thought it'd be funny. "raiding" someone like that is never the right thing to do though, just saying
tim out
NGX - imagine still doing hosting
Jen - NGX Hosting's not dead. But MC Hosting is lol
FzOrb - Not so patriotic of my country.
