GamerOmega - Several days ago i came accross this hosting called "Enchanted Hosting", their domain is from freenom, http://client.enchantedhosting.tk.
Searching for ToS or Privacy Policy don't seem to return anything besides Discord's.
Trying to see The ISP of Their domain returns OVH SAS, Which means that they might be also running on a free trial VPS as soon as they can't afford a 1$ xyz domain.
Aaron_ - GamerOmega Probably Using OVH free trials
owoSctrz - Ovh don't have free trials may be they could be lazy to buy a paid domain for saving money yk
Aaron_ - owoSctrz Aren't these valid? - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-11-02/1635841511-734242-image.png
ItsFalcon - Aaron_ wait then wait wait wait bruhh found one more host https://discord.gg/xX3fTpW4 axoloxt abusing free trial ðŸ˜‚
Timanttikuutio - owoSctrz if you have to think twice about a 2â‚¬ domain, you shouldn't be running a host.  (they clearly don't have enough money)
Timanttikuutio - If you have to worry about paying 2â‚¬ YEARLY then you clearly can't pay 50â‚¬+ a month for a dedi, and no running ur host off of a VPS is not a solution
Shershah - Aaron_ i found one host abusing free trial and it is paid host ðŸ¤£ https://discord.gg/ECJfK7tF
