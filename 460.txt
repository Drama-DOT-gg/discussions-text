L4db - NEW DISCORD SERVER OF THIS BULLSHIT HOSTING: https://discord.gg/YK5Chb44bp"

Hello, once again welcome to the Discussion, this time omninodes.xyz is the suspect, owned by Enfernee, and have reputable ratings at TrustPilot

Short Background
Omninodes is one of the company based on the Philippines, and offering servers and services using their Asian nodes (SG Nodes to be exact), this company formed after the closure of Green-Bull (India), and they have plenty of customers from Green-Bull.

The true story:
On Tuesday, Midnight (Philippine Time) Server and Panel are mulfunctioning, and then after that day, noon time, owner have contacted OVH(+Contabo) (their server provider) and OVH(+Contabo) said that his account has been suspended.

Wednesday, Noon time, Enfernee is still discussing with OVH(+Contabo) and they said that they will give the files, tonight, and my friend contacted me that his server is back but outdated files.

Thursday, Enfernee said that he paid for the nodes, but OVH(+Contabo) don't want to give the files, meanwhile from my friend, while we are discussing about this he mentioned too that the ip was given yesterday was not yet arrived to him, nor assigned to his server account, so technically Enfernee doesn't paid for the nodes, because OVH(+Contabo) has a policy that if you do not pay for the servers, you wouldn't get your files,  after that some time later, all servers has been returned but no files, like newly installed servers.

Friday, Noon-time, Omninodes have been sold to the user named PinoyAko, Enfernee sell his company because he is busy for studies (but that was his excuse)  and time passes, Night-time, all Servers and Panel has been suspended and non-accessible, his Discord Server has been deleted, Enfernee unfriended all of his Customers and disabled, allow direct messages.

from one of my friends screenshot:


And Side note from my friend that i contacted too about this same issue:
My friend paid almost 1,800+php for Advanced Payment, when the server and hosting has been suspended, he dm'ed again Enfernee, and said he will see if he can refund the advanced payment, and after that he was unfriended by enfernee and not answering his calls.

L4db - If you need one point about this discussion:
The owner did not pay for the nodes, which are expensive since it is OVH, lol
L4db - one thing, enfernee make his studies as his excuse since he cannot revive back the nodes, which anytime can be deleted by OVH, rip.
Daftscientist - lmfao another wannabe kid
L4db - Daftscientist woah, what a great reponse! 😃
L4db - Update: One former customer has been scammed by the same hosting, and decided to move to other hosts, Thank Goodness.
Daftscientist - lol
Joshcool3TV - Hello! ako nga pala c Josh a Minecraft Filipino YouTuber and ako yung Owner ng NemocraftSMP which is powered by Omninodes noon..Enfernee give me a 2GB server para sa sponsorship at masimula ko yung first ever Minecraft server ko noon which is yung Nemocraft yung problema kolang about dito is...when i asked na bibigyan kami nila ng 5GB server sinabi nya na kailangan ko mag pay ng 375 pesos every month which is..nagtataka na kami ng members bat kailangan pa namin mag babayad? napaka unfair naman ata yun sa Spinosponsoran nya kaya mapilitan kami na lumipat sa ibang hosting...kasi my friend also told me na parang scam nadaw yung ginagawa nya..which is napa isip ako na tama yung kaibigan ko...gladly nakalipat kami before mangyare to...let's just say na Worthless yung sponsorship dahil dyan - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-07/1620404506-133600-annotation-2021-05-08-002125.png
L4db - Update: i have some poems from our friend @Joshcool3TV 

They intend to give us 2GB sponsor, then we need to pay every month for the extra 3GB to get 5GB and create the server, That's unfair.
Jedrik - Joshcool3TV 

Translation:

Hello! I'm Josh, a Filipino Minecraft Youtuber and I am the owner of NemocrafySMP which was running on Omninodes. Enfernee gave me a 2GB server for our sponsorship so I can start my first ever Minecraft server which is Nemocraft. My only problem is that when I asked them to give us a 5GB server he told us we had to pay 375 pesos every month, which
made us think "Why would we need to pay". It seems unfair to us so we were forced to switch to a different hosting since my friend also told me that it's a scam. I realized that my friend was right, and thankfully we moved before this happened. Let's just say the sponsorship was worthless because of this.

Mabuhay 🇵🇭
L4db - Jedrik Thank you very much for the Translation, kudos to this forum site!
Joshcool3TV - #OMNISCAM ang nararapan! Patulfo! pa check ka y mare Jessica at deretso na sa Bilibid ni derek

Jedrik - L4db Business permits don't apply jn this case
L4db - Jedrik but they're required? right?
Jedrik - Nevermind, it does apply, and they are required in the Philippines my bad!
L4db - I'm planning to make hosting based here in PH, but the problem is the permits before operating. you need to comply them
LordOlympia - Wait... there are actually a philippine-based hosting?! LOL Bobo AMP!

Amazing13 - you have no BALLS Enfernee! Good luck on your carrier! Professional Scammer 😎
matersven - he busy sucking his own cock that's why he didn't pay
L4db - Hello everyone, we got some words of wisdom from Arzhelios#9936 from TrustPilot reviews, please read below. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-08/1620469468-412753-image.png
End - Glad I didn't accept his offer lol. I recommend shockbyte, they have a very good support team and they respond quickly, I didn't experience any downtime yet. But sometimes their CPU is kinda slow. But yea I can assure you personally shockbyte is good. If you know how to configure or setup ubuntu, well it'll be better if you rent a machine from OVH, But they do not accept sms/gcash payment. Shockbyte do. 🙂
Just wanna help the owners/servers that got scammed by Enfernee. I feel you guys ofc for those who lost their files.
TheLegit - End The support team of shockbyte is so slow. I've been using sparkedhost for only $3/gb that also has sms/gcash payment.
LordOlympia - End LOL! yes Shockbyte is better but their customer support SUCKS!!
ShAmInGDooM - L4db can i talk to you privacy we
Arzhelios - So my feedback from Trustpilot reached here, I'm glad.
L4db - oh my good lord, the discord server is returned join here:
https://discord.gg/YK5Chb44bp
L4db - Do you believe that, it is NOT Enfernee's Fault?



BUT WE HAVE THIS..


means that enfernee sold his Company and everything to PinoyAko, after the servers are suspended by OVH(+Contabo). lmao - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-11/1620715266-78932-image.png

L4db - ShAmInGDooM where?
mikee - Oh.. This is a dramatic turn of events. Naghahanap ako ng pinoy own Minecraft server.  Buti nalang di ko na consider ito. Nakakagulat na active ang discord at website. Parang disaster waiting to happen again. Kudos nalang na nakapag live ulit sila using the same company name.

So far happy ako sa Agila Host.
https://agilahost.com

Highly recommended ang support at server.

https://discord.gg/jjct3rTkgg
TheLegit - mikee Paano namin mapapagkatiwalan ang agilahost? Wala silang status page, trustpilot reviews at yung discord nila di pa masyadong organized. Pati nga yung mga ibang pinoy hosting dito may issue din katulad ng javacrafthosting at polarnodes. Mas maganda na gumamit nalang ng ibang mga hosting.
mikee - TheLegit 

Sa bagay. Pero magkakatiwalaan mo ba talaga ang trust pilot? Kung isipin niyo nangyari sa Omni, may trust pilot and yet here we are.
Di natin alam kung mga tropa lang nila nag popost dun.

Check agilahost website. They arent just game hosting. They host different legit company websites. And I also emailed their support. Bihira may email na hindi gmail or yahoo or kung ano anong pwede mong ifake. Responsive.

Ang linis ng discord nila. Wala kung anu anong channel na walang kwenta.
Sorry pero supporter talaga ako lalo na kung pinoy. Support your own ika nga

Tingnan natin. Pero sa ngayon, ok pa. Tutuloy ko muna ang see how this goes.
Free trial pa naman. Sila lang nag offer ng trials. Bakit ka naman mag rereklamo sa libre.
TheLegit - mikee Kailan ba nagstart ang agilahost?
TheLegit - mikee Also, kun tropa man nila magpopost doon madedetect agad ng trustpilot.
mikee - TheLegit 

Domain lookup mo ung agilahost.com
Registered May 2020

Scroll down ka sa facebook page nila. Mas matanda pa sila kaysa Omni at Polar.

Chineck ko rin customers nila. Mga legit.
Medium enterprise.

Domain lookup is a domain checker kung kailan nag nagstart ung domain name.
Omninode.xyz - Created: 2020-12-08
Polarnodes.xyz - Created: 2021-05-13

Saka isa pa. ang XYZ domains ay $1 lang sa namecheap. Alam mong kuripot kung XYZ e.
TheLegit - mikee pero oks na din kung XYZ kaysa sa tk hahahah. Try ko nga yang agilahost salamat lods ah.
mikee - @TheLegit Wala siguro harm kung gamitin ung trial sa Agila.
Backup mo nalang files mo kung doubt ka parin. Para sure na safe ung pinaghirapan mo.

Ang natuwa ako sa Agila ay di mo na sila kailangan kontakin para mag deploy. Sobrang automated nila. Alam mong professional at ambitious. Saka meron silang google at facebook ads. Nag visit lang ako sa page nila, bigla nagkaroon ng ads sa feed ko e.. Ibig sabihin may budget.
TheLegit - mikee naka trial ka pre?
mikee - @TheLegit 

Yes lodi for MC. Saka meron silang public server for Rust and Dont Starve Together.
L4db - Their panel is always down lol

crafters - Is Omninode dead? OR I got kicked out of their discord channel?

I didn't post anything there yet s0 I am pretty sure I did not violate anything. 
But I noticed I don't belong to the group anymore and their website is now dead.
TheLegit - crafters seems dead
