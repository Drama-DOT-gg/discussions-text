DNSPcommunity - so my friend named Aaron asked me to invite him to hosts I said if you would like I can invite you to something else 
he said ok and I send him an invite to virtual node support he found a host named foxy who has been seen to be using digital oceans free trial so he made a ticket asking for proof that foxynodes pay for their nodes on virtual nodes support 
they send him this 
and told that it is hosted on hetzneder and when he ip checked them they were on digital ocean which he send the proof of paying 8$
node check on in1
in2 check 
all the nodes ip and domin
so i say they are not paying for there nodes - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-01-19/1642601569-941891-screenshot-2022-01-19-192029.png

DNSPcommunity - it said make payment not paid
Dvij1233 - DNSPcommunity that digital ochen one is not a payment proof
Dvij1233 - it's just a estimate cost
Knockoff - bro first why making at us
if we even blacklisted the host it will not change anything most of them who used it will be there
DNSPcommunity - Dvij1233 ik its not payment proof they have many nodes of the digital ocean and only send 2 proof about it and also thats just a estimated not paid
Dvij1233 - DNSPcommunity digitalochen for a hosting is just shit
DNSPcommunity - Knockoff but why did you ban my friend for asking proof
Aaron_ - Knockoff Are you braindead? or do you just want to tarnish your reputation?
DNSPcommunity - Dvij1233 but they are using it right without paying
Knockoff - DNSPcommunity i did not want but she was being a bit too annoying
Knockoff - Aaron_ oh u there hi
Aaron_ - Knockoff Oh no, asking questions is annoying now. Lets not forget I was being pinged multiple times for no reason where I didn't even ping you guys once.
DNSPcommunity - Knockoff ik I have saw screenshot he was trying to be professional asking for proof but you guys only giving him 8$ payment proof and only one email which is not even full
and note he is not she its he aaron is male
Knockoff - Aaron_ we never said u to not ping us
