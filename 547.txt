accepts to make deal with falix to destroy other hosts - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-23/1621773758-634828-6.png
Chirag - RusshvithSJ accepts to make deal with falix to destroy other hosts

You are completely wrong here. He says he made a deal with Lamaker to not destroy Falix, and you're saying he made a deal with Falix to destroy other hosts.
RusshvithSJ - Chirag yeah sorry my bad
pog - J0SH Yep this person should be banned he is also ddosing my servers for no reasons.
Chirag - pog you're fucking 12...
J0SH - @BrandonC make a new discord account and dm me
HackioCrack10 - BrandonC why are you doing all this things?
HackioCrack10 - J0SH Just make a deal with him, he can delete all the servers and stuff make a deal pls
HackioCrack10 - BrandonC ok but thats not the solution
J0SH - BrandonC This ain't the solution mate, the better solution would be to contact authorities if you believed that a host was running illegally.
J0SH - What do you want to know?
HackioCrack10 - J0SH Is your host illegally mounted?
J0SH - It's been solved. Just not marked resolved.
J0SH - Tell me what you want to know and I'll explain how it was resolved..
J0SH - that ain't gonna happen, it's never getting resolved because it's been confirmed mate, that information is months old and people change.
Ayaan - He is dossing my VPS servers and website, ban him
Ash777 - HackioCrack10 idk but his host scammed lot of people. they said for boosting server you will get vps but most of the people never got the vps he just said that subnet expensive , like isnt that what you should have thought before announcing the rewards
J0SH - Ash777 Originally I thought only a couple of people would boost, but it ended up going over 30 and I physically couldn't pay for it. I didn't mean for it to be a scam.
Ash777 - J0SH well thats why smart people says offer valid till stock last
J0SH - That is a VPN
Ash777 - you didnt meant to scam but it was a scam for the boosters
J0SH - BrandonC Get a warrant from the police to get your real IP from the VPN provider ü§£
Puggo - I'll contact https://xtom.com/ abuse email. 
@BrandonC  They'll love to hear what you have done.
ExoticalCat - BrandonC Hi
I think you know me
ANKIT - Yes,He has also ddosed my Vps.please ban him
Puggo - BrandonC The IP provider is XTOM.
ANKIT - BRUH PLS BAN PLSS THEN NO VPS SERVER WILL BE SAFE
HackioCrack10 - ExoticalCat WHY YOU ARE ALWAYS ON ALL THE CONVERSATIONS
pog - BrandonC Can you stop ddosing GuitarHost?
ExoticalCat - HackioCrack10 Lol no
I am not everywhere
HackioCrack10 - ANKIT BrandonC is doing great things in my opinion. He is doing illegal things to make the ilegals host getting closed
Tomas - HackioCrack10 Ah yes, this is logical
HackioCrack10 - Tomas is my logic
J0SH - just give me a day before fucking my host up
HackioCrack10 - J0SH but the nodes are up right?
J0SH - HackioCrack10 nope, he's permanently suspended one of our nodes, and Ikoula isn't providing the data.
Puggo - BrandonC I'll contact them then AND XTOM.
HackioCrack10 - BrandonC How do you now that
HackioCrack10 - is now everything solved?
J0SH - @BrandonC Can you confirm the amazon phishing site was just static?
HackioCrack10 - pls can you 2 make a deal
J0SH - BrandonC admin@quackhost.uk
J0SH - nothing at the moment
HackioCrack10 - i want to see the proof
J0SH - My mail server doesn't accept spam, just gets rejected. Might just be taking a bit of time or your mail application isn't authenticated (dkim &amp; spf). Could you try to send one to josh@somadesigns.org instead?
J0SH - Nevermind, received it.
J0SH - For all i know that javascript could be sending a request to a backend script.
J0SH - Could you upload the folders to a GitHub repository?
J0SH - definitely unzipping that in a sandbox
Puggo - lol imagine if josh just gets zip bombed
J0SH - not even putting the sandbox on my pc, gonna buy a vps just for that
HackioCrack10 - J0SH you are defenlly rich
J0SH - its like 2 pound lmao
HackioCrack10 - J0SH yes you are rich i dont have 2 pounds
J0SH - jokes on you brandon, we've got TPC to make sure you piss off
Chirag - J0SH TPC? who/what is that?
J0SH - thatspretty.cool
Chirag - J0SH and you still haven't patched disk filling üëè
J0SH - It isn't deployed yet lmao
HackioCrack10 - is now all solved?
Chirag - BrandonC what is the issue with quackhost btw? cba to read entire thread
HackioCrack10 - BrandonC can we be friends?
Chirag - BrandonC tbh, I can make a drama.gg thread on ANY host. You should check all the proofs once, before you do something and feel sorry for it later.
Chirag - BrandonC Yep, but you should check proofs no matter what.
Chirag - @BrandonC also can you also add me on discord? Chirag.#0001
Chirag - BrandonC k, see mail
leastile - kinda sussy ngl
BaconHead - HackioCrack10  ya fucking idiot first off he did an illegal thing so he deserves to get a punishment and then on top of that the evidence of illegal activities carried by josh is so many months old like stop being a pos and fucking learn that he isn't carrying out any illegal activities now no one cares about what happened months ago unless you just want a thriving host to be closed at any cost
Jedrik - BrandonC which is why i exist, i get rid of these kinds of hosts

That isn't a solution, nor do we support it. Don't use "having a drama.gg thread" as a reason, please, thanks. You're not helping anyone improve nor learn a lesson. You've lost the concept and main idea of the forum, it's not to completely destroy hosts, it's to either create awareness, bring attention to a host's problems, or helping the host identify their mistakes, issues, etc.
HackioCrack10 - is now all solved? 

pls JoSH make a deal with brandon
HackioCrack10 - BaconHead LANGUAGE
eraters - HackioCrack10 shut up, we can say fuck all we want here
mtt - HackioCrack10 are you like 8 years old? anyone can cuss or say anything they want, bruh grow up
EmeraldMike - Well then i now have a even better reason to not be on drama.gg
J0SH - BrandonC It has been confirmed since october 2020, we've changed. Also, wheres my zip file?
J0SH - It's not only the host your destroying, your destroying minecraft servers that people have spent months and months on. It's not fun.
J0SH - Forgot to mention, you went after DynamicHost (https://dynamichost.xyz) just because they apparently merged with a person on drama.gg which is untrue (I'm a dev over there and I ain't aware)
J0SH - BrandonC Oh also, you were CCed in that email you braindead idiot.
BaconHead - HackioCrack10 Yeah go after my language and miss all the points I mentioned.
HackioCrack10 - JoSH have you make a deal with Brandon i dont want to loose all my data
Chirag - BrandonC check email
J0SH - BrandonC Damage is already done, we will work with the authorities on this one.
J0SH - It was a BCC sorry. (blind carbon copy)
Chirag - J0SH we will work with the authorities on this one.

says the one who used nulled argon in the past.
Tomas - Chirag Read what he said, he didn't use it in the end but considered it
J0SH - people make mistakes, get over it.
J0SH -  - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-25/1621955666-325305-image.png
J0SH - Persuaded suppliers to unsuspend the node, you didn't affect us at all.

Chirag - bad say thanks to me too for filling de1 disk and keeping panel and cp down for hours and then you delete all servers on de1. GG
HackioCrack10 - O my god PLS is now all correct?

HackioCrack10 - BaconHead poor boy Brandon C
