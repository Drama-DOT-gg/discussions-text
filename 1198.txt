QloxXy - i used to sell user data of banned users but i stopped
SkyAdmin - QloxXy Oh nice fake account idiotic clown! Do you think that people will believe you as an Official Qlox account. You can't even fool yourself.
Aaron_ - SkyAdmin Hi, Jamie owns dashactyl and he has the right to ban anyone he likes. 

Also wheres the question?
SkyAdmin - If you whould like to DM me im waiting for you HasX#1457
Aaron_ - SkyAdmin You sure? Seen him posting on multiple threads
SkyAdmin - Aaron_ "Why the fuck do you like hurting someone who tries to open a free host?" Right there, can you fucking read?
Shershah - Dude stfu u r making qlax much worst and u dont even know simple sysadmin cmds idiot
SkyAdmin - Aaron_ Do you think that people will fall into this trap? Anyone can create a similar username even you
Aaron_ - SkyAdmin In this "community" its a ritual to bully every single free host owner. Someone raid the discord server. Someone DDoS it. Someone just creates fake dramas.

You are wrong. We are a community solely to shutdown scam servers. Your owner have been drama.gg'ed multiple times for being a dickhead and homophobic. The server you work at has been drama.gg'ed because it uses vpses from GCP. You don't provide proof that you pay for them so we are free to make assumptions.
Aaron_ - SkyAdmin Sorry I didn't read it properly, We hurt users who do fraud. If they provide proof they don't we appologize and leave.
Aaron_ - SkyAdmin Quite really not sure.
SkyAdmin - Aaron_ Ah yes and community of clowns yes.
Aaron_ - SkyAdmin No, There are more than 300+ small free hosts who are running legally. Nobody is drama.gg'ing them. Your host is most probably running illegally.
Tomas - SkyAdmin please can you and the rest of your non-pubescent community leave this forum
Yesyes - SkyAdmin imagine denying the truth
Aaron_ - So @SkyAdmin do you have any proof to back your statements up? Because you are saying qloxhost is legit but you are never providing proof.
Aaron_ - Did you just delete your own post?
SkyAdmin - Aaron_ Proof xd
Aaron_ - SkyAdmin Let me try my best to show proof, You also try your best to show me the owners bank statements.
SkyAdmin - Tomas can you and your clowngang leave the earth? Thanks
SkyAdmin - Aaron_ Im not going to proof you my host. If you leave us alone, we leave you alone
Tomas - SkyAdmin Are you actually 12 or something?

Please leave before you actually destroy everyones braincells
Aaron_ - SkyAdmin If you leave us alone, we leave us alone

Is your mind fucked up or something? Whats with that grammer dude
Aaron_ - SkyAdmin If you do not provide proof then you are digging your own hole.
Aaron_ - @SkyAdmin You are acting like the whole circus right now
SkyAdmin - Aaron_ one spelling mistake = fucked up brain, hmm strange
Tomas - Actually, you do realise how you retarded you are for flaming a community on a site owned by that community?

You actually have no braincells do you?

Why would you make a thread about Drama.gg on Drama.gg - no one gives a fuck. And, no one actually gives a fuck about the host either.

So either go cry to Mommy or just fuck off?? You aren't contributing anything.
Aaron_ - Can you tell me why are you crying about jamie blacklisting you guys?  Also why did you delete your own post?
Aaron_ - SkyAdmin When I made a mistake you told me I couldn't read. Weird ain't it
SkyAdmin - Aaron_ Like i said , i don't belong to this shitcommunity. You read the message others don't have to do it.
Aaron_ - SkyAdmin Sorry?
Aaron_ - Are you ignoring my question? you being fr right now?
Aaron_ - SkyAdmin And yes you don't belong here. You are underaged it seems like.
SkyAdmin - Aaron_ We don't cry , we laugh
QloxXy - ok bro honestly idc how much u fuck around or fight at drama.gg, i mean sure i hate drama.gg but ehhh atleast i dont take it this far, but just dont fight pls rn ur fucking my reputation up even more, if u wanna fight them dont mention me.
Aaron_ - SkyAdmin If you are laughing at jamie blacklisting you guys then the thread is invalid. This is not a place to share drinks and laugh.
QloxXy - QloxXy then*
SkyAdmin - Aaron_ Spelling mistake underaged -  &gt; Too busy
Aaron_ - QloxXy Your reputation is negative now. I doubt a user will even think of using your host after seeing your staff argue shit that doesn't even make sense
Aaron_ - Also this is a screenshot of the 1st post of this thread that was deleted  (For the new readers) - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-11-11/1636650315-292094-image.png
Aaron_ - SkyAdmin Its not a spelling mistake, did you meant to say its a bad way of presenting it? anyways I think it was put together perfectly
QloxXy - Aaron_ yeah in the drama.gg community this community isnt VERY big yet its still small and tons of ppl dont know about it yet.
QloxXy - i mean i didnt even know about it until someone gave me a link to the first psot made about me
Tato - I legit just tried to dm him, got blocked, lmao - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-11-11/1636650434-714337-image.png
Aaron_ - Tato He tries to ignore the reality. Nothing more.
Tato - Aaron_ No, There are more than 300+ small free hosts who are running legally. Nobody is drama.gg'ing them. Your host is most probably running illegally.

Yeah, this is true. There are real free hosting services out there but you people just ruin the name of "Free Hosting" with things like Kitten Nodes
Aaron_ - QloxXy Yes not big YET.
Tato - Congratulations you're gonna hit 300 views soon - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-11-11/1636650565-196749-image.png
Aaron_ - I can already imagine users mass dm'ing the links to the threads on them on their server
QloxXy - Aaron_ yes thats what i said are u blind or what
Aaron_ - Tato üëè Pog moment
Aaron_ - QloxXy No, I just agreed to your post. Its not big YET.
Tato - Aaron_ Petition for someone to raid this server in the sense of deleting it and uninstalling Discord also with someone I mean In the sense of the 9 year old owner
QloxXy - Aaron_ yes its not big at all and it seems as it has been growing rather slowly so clearly drama.gg isnt good at getting their little website out to people
Aaron_ - Tato Signed ‚úî
Aaron_ - QloxXy The owners do not plan on growing it asking for users to invite others.
Tato - QloxXy Yeah well at least it's an active community unlike your dead asf server for your host
Aaron_ - But still imagine creating a thread on drama.gg inside of drama.gg
Tato - Aaron_ And making such accusations as well
Tato - And not all free hosts are "tired" of drama.gg
Only the ones that are scams and get exposed on drama.gg
Eat the truth child
Tato - @SkyAdmin Aight then kiddo, close the thread now this is resolved
Aaron_ - No you - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-11-12/1636735905-849394-image.png
