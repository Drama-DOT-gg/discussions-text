IoNetty - Hey! This is a bit of a paid host tier list, made one before but i'm trying to make it better. If you have any suggestions on what to add please respond to the thread, thanks.

Minecraft Server Hosting tier list. 

Note, this was completely unbias. I paid for this out of my own pocket. This whole review is 100% honest.

WitherHosting - https://witherhosting.com

CPU: Intel Core i9 10900K

CPU Performance: 104CPS, that's really good! - Note, this was measured with Chunky, a chunk rendering plugin. It tests CPU Performance.

Memory: WitherHosting uses DDR4 3200MHz to push the i9 10900K well with your server. - Note, this is your server cache you can say, what runs it as well as it can.

Storage: 100% NVMe storage to provide great performance, my server started in 1 second! - Note, this is what holds your server. With the fast storage your server is lighting fast.

Locations: WitherHosting has a plethora of locations, here they are! https://witherhosting.com/locations.html - Note, this is where the host has servers. So where your minecraft server can get located.

Final: WitherHosting has great performance on a budget with 1$ per GB ram and cheap cores to go with your server, I would use it! Here is a promocode for everyone who read this far. Code: Performance

Notes: Location used was NYC and server specs were 4GB Ram and 4 VCores.

PebbleHost - https://pebblehost.com

CPU: Intel Xeon E5-1650V3

CPU Performance: 15CPS, that's REALLY bad. They also modified the scores, why did it show 1500? - Note, this was measured with Chunky, a chunk rendering plugin. It tests CPU Performance.

Memory: PebbleHost uses DDR4 2400MHz, pretty overrated for the Intel Xeon E5-1650V3 but it's pretty good.

Storage: Enterprise Grade SSD storage to provide pretty good performance with the Intel Xeon E5-1650V3. 

Locations: PebbleHost has Canada &amp; Europe, pretty much it.

Final: Tried to modify scores. BOO. Performance sucked anyway.

Notes: Location used was North America / Canada and server spces were 4GB Ram Budget.
