dchu096 - Hello i dont wanna do this thread as it will hugely damage him but hes reaching pushing my limit.

Zachery is a good person with lots of knowledge on linux, i do respect that but what he do to us are called unacceptable.

Decide to post user datas

We both are in a public community with 500+ members and guess what he did

send the admin side with usernames to public. We have our privacy policy which we follow strictly but seems he decide to ignore!

Blocking my account from SPA!

My panel, just fine with a user blocker plugin. Its surely not to mess around with but this is what happened

i locked out of my own service. I wonder why.

he also said this



Thats surely my account and he dont own it.

I have to go SSH and create a new user, find out my admins is gone and hes the only spa thats online.



clear enough, hes not blocked but im blocked and who could have done that??? Sure i can go block myself but im not an idiot blocking myself on my own service.

Trying to DDOS my service


Fun topic. Even i have a path ddos protection it surely cant can handle 10 botnets of cindy... and i have never expected to get ddosed from one of my staff members.

proof that he have spa:

dchu096 - comfyy not surprised too.
Deveroonie - Wait so he wiped ur node
dchu096 - Deveroonie But my node's not wiped so guess he didnt do that
Shershah - dchu096 maybe he ran rm -rf /var/www/pterodactyl.(this delete all panel files.)
Deleted User - Well ig im just not gonna reply?i  really dont wanna ruin mehosts rep if its the only way to defend myself so ig continue
Deleted User - _MrKnight_ when did i say that?
Deleted User - eraters ahh quiet a achievement aint it?
Deleted User - Shershah i dont have ssh :/
Deleted User - _MrKnight_ i was never in any surgery 😅 maybe i forgot since ''i lost 90% of my braincells"
Deleted User - comfyy suprised for what? exactly
Deleted User - _MrKnight_ if i am 9 how old is dchu last time i checked i was the one managing partnerships,prices and sales in mehost.Since dchu couldnt manage them accurately.If you want a example dm me my user and tag is Zachery#8732
IoNetty - Zachery Right. I did 90% of those partnerships. You managed sales due to dchu taking breaks and such. Everyone has a life, and at this point you don't. How many threads have you been involved in with US? You have caused us trouble, we want some justice too you know. You can't just have your fun doing whatever you want. We want to be succesful. You can't do everything at one company, Tesla may have started with 2 people but then worked day on day.
IoNetty - Oh and for sales, you didn't do half or even a quarter of it. Half the time it was due to me and dchu being offline due to timezone issues.
Deleted User - IoNetty 90% of partnerships which all were terminated because they brought us no good? yes
IoNetty - Zachery You don't know half the story, we were already dealing with those. Just dchu wasn't leniant enough to get it done of all things.
Deleted User - IoNetty yes exactly all sales were done during the times you banned me no new sales happened when i was the finance manager
Deleted User - IoNetty one thing i agree with you.
IoNetty - Zachery Incorrect, no sales happened when you were financial manager either. They were due to referals by me. 🙂
IoNetty - I actively advertised mehost. At this point your ruining our rep getting us into threads that we shouldn't be involved in. It takes us ages to get out of it and it's more trouble then it's worth.
IoNetty - At this point I think you lost your brain cells, you blocked dchu from spa for a disagreement. We could all tell something was wrong with you and you were gonna do something, do you think that were all brain dead? You didn't have complete permissions for a reason. The only reason you had SPA was to manage a minecraft server, that's it.
IoNetty - I'm waiting for your response, send it.
Deleted User - IoNetty number one thats what i said no sales happened when i was the finance manager because i do not manage marketing
Deleted User - IoNetty disagreement? you do realise he could make a account from terminal and unblock himself?Unless you consider me to be stupid i dont see how you could think its because of that but ok
IoNetty - Zachery You were saying it like no sales happened when you weren't too. Which was incorrect, at this point your spitting lies. Can you back up what you say? I know you were finance, not marketing. But your saying like we got no sales while you were not finance, which is incorrect. I'll say it again.
Deleted User - IoNetty ok if sales did happen when i was finance manager state them(im not referring to web hosting because i was not given much info about that)
Deleted User - IoNetty dchu started this thread its his mess not mine.
Deleted User - IoNetty you do realise im on a trip and im trying to get some rest but seeing the amount of false info i really dont think your giving me a choice
Deleted User - but io.netty if you really want me to ruin your rep so be it i advise its better for you to keep quiet
Deleted User - IoNetty i said you got sales when i was not finance and not when i was finance,not vise versa
dchu096 - Zachery while im studying exams and i have to go ssh to do that? How annying can you be zach...

If you dont wanna respond to this thread take a break. unless your browser

you told me this in DM:

Ok anyways to top everything off before my trip.Do Note a drama.gg thread is actually nothing i have no company to get my SEO ruined.number 2 Drama.gg is 95% kids.Number 3 What you see of me is not at all which limits me The internets empowers people like you and me it gives us a way to learn,Voice our visions,Follow our passions and many more and no one truly can be stopped in it.Anyways before i leave let me tell you a secret 2 staff in mehost are actually my alts which i have been using regularly sometimes not so much i wont tell you who but note ill still observe mehost and help in ways i am able to.and last but not least note i see the internet from a bigger spectrum then you i have observed this with the few months I’ve been in contact with you.just remember things are not what they seem to be.And i can tell you have not hurt me in any way gladly infact i feel much better after this happened
  
  so go take a break and get of dgg. if it does nothing to you why you care
Deleted User - My Journey in mehost
Ok basically lets get to it.Me and Dchu knew each other from another host called G-Host which got raided. then Dchu asked me to join MeHost.Upon joining dchu gave me the highest role * basically its a “owner” like role and since it was late i went to sleep.I wake up to see that i was demoted to management dept but i didnt really think much of it maybe dchu was just rearranging roles i thought then later dchu dmed me and said that some people said that i should not be part of the management in mehost when i asked who i get to know that its from someone called Sid he was the dev of a bot named jericho and Dchu for this one reason made him “owner” for a partnership showing that he does not value security and just for a partnership made him owner anyways next after hearing this i confronted sid he said i was trying to steal his bot and that no one trusts me.well hesring this i asked staff and no one really said anything.afterwards i do admit to pinging everyone in announcements to ask if there was anythign wrong with me being management and yes i do admit this was unproffesional of me so i afterwards went outside when i come back i see that im banned and that dchu blocked me with no info what so ever on what happened and i got to know of what happened from a friend of mine anyways i still wanted to help mehost so i suggested a smp with a large playerbase which needed a host so they eventually ended up partnering then a few days later i get a dm from Dchu saying mehost got raided feeling bad i offered help to stop mehost from closing down again and to what ik i was made owner so basically i had planned a complete remodel to prices,marketing,financing,partnerships and all afterwards i pinged all the owners to hold a “meeting” but none of them responded then i noticed someone named jesse was the management dep - note jesse is a complete ammature when it comes to Linux,hosting,financing and such so when i noticed this i dmed her and asked her how she was management dept just 1 min later i got banned and dchu dmed me saying he had recieved reports about me and he himself admitted its because of jesse anyways as i said that this was stupid and all i did was dm jesse and asked how he got management dep afterwhich he said he banned me for pinging owners for “no reason”.Anyways i was banned for a day and was unbanned again.This time i was made management dep this time i tried to do my job without being banned again i went to dchu and told him how the prices are unsustainable and that they could not get us profit.And that due to Free nitro from epic games many people collected their boost plans which were absurd and like 80% of server resources were used for boost plans.So i thought since he didnt want to listen to my advice ill leave him be.Then i decided to work on a theme for mehost so a admin called cactus made me a acc without SPA(note this).And due to me not knowing the pass reset link was sent to my email i could not even login to my acc.Anyways i wake up the next day to see im demoted to member when i asked what happened a owner called neil said that i had abused my spa and had deleted a users server(suprising how i was the one being accused after i dmed neil about something) anyways he proceeded to send me a screenshot with my acc as admin.Then i told dchu to check panel logs and check for the ip from neils acc and “my” acc if they were the same we would know if it was neil trying to frame me.Neil knowing he couldnt win started accusing me of hacking his account and that he was going to leave because he kept getting accused and he left.Afterwards dchu made me management dept again and i went to sleep i then wake up to me being banned and in the group chat there is no info with just people saying i ruined mehost again and they left the group chat and dchu blocked me again with no info then i come to know from a friend that dchu had accused me of raiding mehost and running rm -rf on his nodes.And even when i tried to talk it out with dchu through my friend dchu didnt listen so knowing its a lost cause i stopped trying but then due to his false claims i was many people started accusing me of raiding and such so i had enough of it .Not only did he lose user data and got raided he could not stand to admit his own fault and went on to accuse me.SO i started a drama.gg thread to prove that i did not raid in anyway.And in the thread i managed to prove that i did not raid.And dchu admitted to accusing me without proof anyways i decide to forgive him and help mehost again,Even after all the trouble he put me through.Anyways here is the reason why The Whole management of Mehost is plan “stupid”.They had a hetzner dedicated server which had 64gb ram and 4 cores for MC hosting one of their plans was $2 for 6gb ram + swap and 5 cores and yet had the nerve to ask me why they were not making profit well thining they didnt think about it i gave them a more sustainable price point for servers.Just 2 days later i see. that the panel name has changed to ME|Dary|Ace and when i asked dchu he said he had sold a node to Dary and Ace both which are hosting companies so i asked him how much money he made he then revealed that he forgot and was too lazy to even ask for the PAYMENT!.So me and Io.netty had to confront them and we came to know that the hosts have no money to pay so we ended up revoking the node.AfterWhich dchu made a announcement saying that he was closing down mehost so i gave dchu some advice and said that closing mehost will result in more losses then gain.And that he should keep on going this happened twice
Deleted User - So in total not only did dchu not even care about what was happening in his host much he was very lazy and often unproffesional and alot of times blamed me without evidence
Deleted User - SO tell me who is more unproffesiona someone who didnt pay attention much and accused me of so many things or me who even despite all he did still tried to help him
and Yes i am a idiot for even trying
Deleted User - anyways bye im trying to enjoy my vacation pls do not disturb me

Deleted User - plus he said he was gonna ddos https://nightnodes.com/
Deleted User - so if your gonna continue saying im "ruining" mehost you should really think it through
eraters - both sides (@Zachery and @dchu096 ) seem to be in the wrong, and both have mass amounts of incompetence
Deleted User - yes i agree we both are imcompetant
Deleted User - eraters btw note me acting wierd in comfyy's screenshots was to see if he would make the same mistake without even investigating
dchu096 - Zachery 

Ahh .. you bought this here. Nightnodes are such a powerful server why would i boot it down? Plus the only ddos tool i know is cindy but i dont know where to buy?

Plus me no money.

The reason why thst exists is i want to know how much ddos can nightnodes csn handle so i can reflect on mehost! 😁
Deleted User - dchu096 just like that i asked you which nodes we could try ddos to reflect on how we can improve did i even ddos? my messages were about should we ddos not ill ddos so you better change what you said
dchu096 - Zachery But your image wont valid. Let me show you my bank. (OD 300) You think i have money for botnets??
Deleted User - this thread should honestly be reneamed to 'MeHost | loss of customer data | unproffesional management | incompetant owner '
dchu096 - ok even i booted nightnodes down does it benefit me?
IoNetty - If that ddos threat is even true, it was due to me making something for nightnodes but then not getting anything..
dchu096 - Zachery Its about you not me. dont try to turn the thread back to me. wont work
Deleted User - dchu096 even if i booted your nodes does it benefit me huh?
Deleted User - dchu096 it will work if your so imcompetant
dchu096 - Zachery yes. you hate us so bad so it does benefit you
IoNetty - Y
dchu096 - search mehost on dgg. 66% of the thread is related to you.
IoNetty - ou wanted revenge on us a few days ago.
Deleted User - dchu096 so now your saying i hate MeHost? wow… last time i checked even when you were thinking about closing mehost i was the one giving you advice and telling you to continue mehost
Deleted User - IoNetty revenge? tell me which part about this is "Revenge"
dchu096 - Zachery indeed. but whether i close or continue does it matter?
IoNetty - not this thread
dchu096 - if im going to end it i can end it its not up to your decision.
IoNetty - dchu096 Your stuck on ovh commitments for another year, so yes it does.
Deleted User - dchu096 yes related to me because of YOU
dchu096 - Back to zach, you startedd off breaking user privacys by sending them in chat what ya on about
Deleted User - dchu096 did i say you cannot end? i send you should continue and not give up never said you must
dchu096 - IoNetty uhh... actually they somehow have a cancel option now so i see what they say
dchu096 - Zachery Yeah i have thanked your suggestion after you told me in DM.
dchu096 - but whats the matter. This thread is about zachery trying to block us out of mehost. and acting idiotic
dchu096 - so lets go back on topic
Deleted User - dchu096 trying to block you out?.Is this some joke?
Deleted User - continue i will get some popcorn to watch your jokes
Deleted User - dchu096 after i started a thread
dchu096 - @Zachery read this
IoNetty - selling 40% share in mehost stock, who buying
dchu096 - theres proof on the first post
Deleted User - dchu096 yes i did break it but which part about only staff accs+no email included in thre screenshot do you not understand
Deleted User - +your talking about me breaking privacy policy? you just posted the screenshot on this thread…..
Deleted User - WITHOUT EVEN BLURRING THE INFO TOO
dchu096 - Privacy policy exists. If you break a privacy you can expect to be demoted
Deleted User - IoNetty me,name the price
IoNetty - Zachery 70 usd paypal
Deleted User - dchu096 yes and? i got demoted and im feeling quite good about it tbh
dchu096 - Zachery then why you revenging?
Deleted User - IoNetty i dont think mehost is worth that much does it include nodes?
dchu096 - If you feel good then dont hop on dgg and tried to byte back on us?
IoNetty - Zachery you can influence the co, you'd own 40%
Deleted User - dchu096 revenging? is there even sucha word plus its not me who started the thread its you! jokes on you cus to defend myself i had no choice but to reveal the full story
IoNetty - hey zach didn't you demote me from mehost from dchu's account
Deleted User - IoNetty hmmmmm so does that mean i can cancel partnerships and stuff
Deleted User - IoNetty no i said "your fired " and you left
dchu096 - Zachery yeah from my account, you basically using my power to force ionetty to hop off?
Deleted User - wait wait wait you just reminded me dchu gave me team viewer access to his pc and left his pc for a while on his discord acc leaving me all the time to raid the discord,rm -rf nodes and much more another reason why he is stupid and does not take proper precautions to protect customer data
dchu096 - Zachery bruh i didnt leave.
Deleted User - dchu096 you were afk
dchu096 - i was sitting eating food while monitoring
dchu096 - Zachery a tiny bit but im still in front of my pc
Deleted User - by "monitoring" you mean searching through stuff on your pc travvling through your pc promoting myself on discord and telling io.netty hes fired?
Deleted User - Zachery and you only realised 2 mins later
Deleted User - any "valid" points?

Deleted User - yes the post which has been closed due to blueboi's childishness
Deleted User - blueboi opened a thread he ended up getting called childish and his thread closed lmao
dchu096 - ok then. how about this thread

https://drama.gg/d/824-mehost/14
dchu096 - If you have a problem with us dont use us. All our threads came from you - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-09-20/1632115779-896865-ae4do6asfq.png
Deleted User - nope one from blueboi for dragging mehost in
dchu096 - If you have a problem with us running go to another host
dchu096 - ok eventaully 4/5 then
80%
Deleted User - dchu096 th ryan one is not mehost thats twilight client
dchu096 - you are not the center of the world
dchu096 - Zachery ok thats even better 4/4 (100%)
Deleted User - dchu096 your right im not the center of the world thats the core
Deleted User - dchu096 yes 4/4 and in the 4/4 one is what you started
dchu096 - i remember theres 1 from xoomoo but you see the mess? you trying to ruin us compared to others
dchu096 - i like being a peaceful company running my own things not zachary started us 5 times on dgg (including the one you started 5min ago)
dchu096 - as said the world dont resolve around you. If you have a issue with us go to another host!

Drama.gg is not for the place complaining about this we are fine
dchu096 - Theres other horrible hosts why dont you start on them?

I bet you cant answer this
dchu096 - You whole issue is trying to ruin us and you will be happy uh?
dchu096 - You are just too Self-centered
dchu096 - square up zach, you not a kid
comfyy - Zachery (im not referring to web hosting because i was not given much info about that)

You can't and won't get access to them, It'll only be managed by Dchu, FatGrizzly, Infinitz &amp; me only. (talking about the new server btw)
Deleted User - dchu096 ruin you? You do realise after all thoes bans i still kept trying to help mehost and not destroy it? You do realise if i did want to ruin mehost i dont have to do anything?
Deleted User - comfyy i said info on finances not access to the panel or server
Deleted User - dchu096 dchu your not a kid stop denying that you have done a sizeable amount of mistakes when running mehost
Deleted User - dchu096 never stated that the world resolved around me im plainly telling you YOUR mistakes
Deleted User - dchu096 if you still dont see that every thread i made was about your mistakes and it includes what could be done to fix the issues never about you made this mistake you should shut down
Deleted User - dchu096 "peaceful" last time i checked without providing proof or even looking through anything ypu blatantly accused me of wiping your nodes
Deleted User - Zachery and i was the one being peaceful by continuing to help you even after all that
Deleted User - Are you even thinking through what you say?
Deleted User - Honestly dchu if you still think im here to ruin mehost .Are you thinking right?
dchu096 - @Robert lets end this thread / mark it as resolved. Guess time to make some peace not trouble

was not gonna do this but i saw zachery closed my other thread so i guess i will do this too.
Deleted User - dchu096 same thing i said from start..
Deleted User - Dchu inside:damm good thing zach decided to stop this would have ended bad
dchu096 - Zachery 

Well... if you going to play that game i can play to the end. But i just wanna give both a good ending so after you close my other one i just decide to close this one too. Happy days
Deleted User - dchu096 i really dont have time to play around im tryna enjoy my vacation
Deleted User - dchu096 good ending?! I am honestly disappointed by how you only see the bad things ive done and never the good things and not only that you went on to twist everything in your favour.I really am a idiot for still trying to help mehost even after all you did
dchu096 - Zachery ahh.... mehost is not the place for you to come in and start interacting with. Its more of a community styled instead of a really professional huge end business and indeed the way you push us will just make things worse. Its better to just forgot about it and enjoy your trip
Deleted User - excuses again huh?
Deleted User - Your not protecting Your precious SEO by making excuses your just proving how childish you are honestly you cant even admit your own wrong doings?
Deleted User - dchu096 My Casual interactions were only with staff and Other then that i actually do proper work by testing partnerships properly.I actually check through prices and i calculated a fair price point for the resource unlike you who didnt give much thought into them or your just dumb(im sure you arent).and ive done more productive work then 70% of your staff considering the time ive been in MeHost and the tasks i was given
Deleted User - Honestly dchu grow up and stop acting childish.If you dont learn to accept your own flaws i honestly doubt that your gonna go far and note if you still want me to help you in mehost i expect a apology tho im 99% sure your too stubborn to do so and if your gonna say i pushed you past your limits stop joking i forgave you for litteraly ruining my reputation on discord accusing me of raiding,nuking and so much more yet ive forgiven you so many times.What i did is nothing compared to what you did.But if your gonna keep being stubborn so be it ill see how far you get
Deleted User - And ionetty you have no clue about whats truly happening dchus only told you his side of his own twisted story and youve never bothered to even look at what truly happened your relatively new to mehost so if you dont know the whole story stop arguing.Honestly i thought you had better judgement then this but you proved me wrong
Deleted User - anyways ive said what i have to say and i see no point in arguing with you both anymore
dchu096 - i remain silence. Say whatever you want to say.
Deleted User - dchu096 so now you start to try act as the victim eh?
dchu096 - Zachery 



oh really zach, because you hate me i got banned from a server that has nothing to do with the case?

i guess the person immature is you.

And as you said, That server is full of kids as according to you. You should ban them first. Thats surely not the proper reason to ban me as immature. Plus im pretty mature in R-SMP



And you honestly should be more professional then this...

Be more professional. R-SMP have nothing to do in this case and i got banned for no reason - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-09-22/1632294558-453241-discord-j3lkinmspp.png
