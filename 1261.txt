Preon - As lightly said in the drama.gg Discord server, an ex staff of UltimateSRV has just scammed me of roughly 40$ in online game items, whether from Twitch Prime Gaming, Roblox, or anything else. Basically, what happened was I had bought him items for these services as a gift package and sent him the codes, after each he promised to repay x$ or x% more in interest from what I had spent. This went on for MONTHS. Eventually, he became Manager at my hosting, and after severe abuse (some users such as Withdrawal were in the server when this happened) on his end, we removed him from staff. He retaliated with blocking me, and by extension, that was basically him refusing to return the money he had essentially stolen from me. I have attached screenshots below:











The screenshots may appear to be dated incorrectly; they are out of order and this event had happened since a while ago (early-mid-late November) An investigation has been initiated by the Roblox support team on his account, which is @retroboom1ng. Please stay away from Retro, for your sake.


For the people who might tell me 'i should have been more cautious' or 'I had put too much trust into him': Yes, I obviously trusted him a little too much, but we had essentially been friends since earlier this year, which I had considered enough to form at least a minor amount of trust. Apparently not.....


This story has been abridged to have the post not be excessively long, but I have confirmed that this information is still up to date and accurate with what I have experienced.

Preon - Clarifying a few things after some discussion that took place within the Discord server:

. The 40$ wasn't spent all at once and it was about a month before he was fired; At that time I would have had no way of knowing that this would just happen suddenly
. The discussion you see above is him asking mostly for Robux and other associated items. I have never dealt with Roblox at all in my life, so if the lost money is seen as an abysmally low amount, I apologize.
. Retro was removed from staff for abusive and disrespectful behavior in a public channel, I have screenshots I can send to you on Discord if you would like to see them as proof. However, the decision to flush him out was not done by me. UltimateSRV has 3 owners which work together in a group. If 2 out of 3 decide to take an action, the remaining vote is not able to override it, which is why I didn't necessarily have a say in this particular demotion.
