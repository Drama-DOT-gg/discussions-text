MarkTheExecutive - This two new free hosts are really popular. They do have fast nodes and 24/7 online server :

https://discord.gg/K9yWtUCGn4 - QloxHost
https://discord.gg/mF9rwKA65G - OxyNodes

 They look leggit. There are some dramas, but personally I don't have issues with it.  Do you think that they are trustworthy?
Thominek - MarkTheExecutive Well not really i have no problems with OxyNodes but with Qloxhost i do the owner and the stuffs he did in the past were very not cool but he said he changed so idk if it is true, Qloxhost may or may not use Free trials from somewhere since they dont show proof of them owning the nodes so i would use OxyNodes rather then Qloxhost but it is ur choice and there is a big chance that u will lose your server by not using the bigger trusted hosting services.
CharityLexus - Idk much about OxyNodes but i'd avoid QloxHost for now, read the new threads about them and you'll see what i mean.
Thominek - CharityLexus ye avoid Qloxhost they arent trusted freenom domains, homophobic/racist owner and free trials (they say they have real nodes but no proof lol)
HasX - Thominek 

Thominek Thats not true. He is nice. Also we don't use free trials. Only we have issues with German node since its overpriced
Loser - qwerty
eraters - avoid oxy too, one of the accounts for his vps's got suspended, and i presume it's due to avoiding payment
Tato - Thominek @MarkTheExecutive here's an essay of all the owner of QloxHost has done

Jamie_ - Avoid QloxHost, they tried deliberately avoiding their dashactyl blacklist.
Aarony - and if you are someone who lives with their parents 
be careful because of Qlox's Dashboard ads ( NSFW AF )
Aarony - Plus I was trying to verify but then it said my acc is an alt just because there was someone else living in the same country and having the same ISP or he could've used a VPN
Aaron_ - MarkTheExecutive In short no. Both hosts use free trials with extremely toxic staffs and owners.
Thominek - HasX he is nice? Lol is saying that gay and black people are bad lol nice
QloxX - Thominek what? i never said black ppl was bad wtf is wrong with u.
TheRealDeal - Aaron_ TheRealDeal#2464 Can you please send me a friend request?
Aaron_ - TheRealDeal Yeah sure.
GKZ - Oxy seems to be absuing hetzner
Kowone - MarkTheExecutive avoid both at once
comfyy - Just save up some money and use Kubbur or other good host. Qlox and Oxy ain't worth it.
Plexed - GKZ we dont use hetzner
we use ovh
Ples - of course these ppl call us not legit, but u can use KittenNodes or OxyNodes if u want to, as idgaf.
Leafy-ui - They really bad, terrible uptime. Always losing nodes every week, and add it again. Repeatly. I better pay $2 than using that garbage
AceyGoBoom - Plexed you also use a gcp free trial sussy plexy
also you do use hetzner and abuse it
WhiteCat - who is badsk?
Thominek - WhiteCat badask? Idk who is that but i think ur trying to say Badsk
WhiteCat - Thominek yeah that is i mean lmao sorry, who is him ?
Thominek - WhiteCat some Underage ass dude who used to do hosts he had like 5+ hosts and all of them failed he just got data loss and ddos attacks on these hosts and he abused hetzner payment something and his dad found out and now hes gone
WhiteCat - Thominek ohh i see thats why plex slandered to be badsk lmao
i just curious, so ive been waiting for v5 oxynodes plex said will not getting dataloss so yeah thats was very good, thanks for answering
Thominek - WhiteCat ye : D
SirCat-Qlox - btw please change the name from qloxhost to kittennodes
Thominek - Kittennodes is legit good hosting the owner has changed and improved a lot but oxy pfttttt dont use oxy
Gamingrock - Lol qlox is now trying to be good xD see new threads
SirCat - Gamingrock im just changing ¯_(ツ)_/¯ and im also tired of plexed abusing me.
AbhiramGamer - MarkTheExecutive Can u send Oxynodes Discord invite link again
It is invalid
Robert - Locking this thread due to it just looking like an advertisement.

Just a general PSA though:
Avoid Qloxhost, Qlox, and just free hosting providers in general. They are usually owned by asses like badsk who don't know what they want to do in their free time. The only trustworthy free hosting providers seem to be Aternos, Minehut, and server.pro.
