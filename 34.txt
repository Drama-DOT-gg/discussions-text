Jedrik - mom im on tv
Sloth - Jedrik old jedrik pfp better
Jedrik - Sloth ur mom better
Bear - isn't falixnodes now very different?
its like from 2019
Jen - Bear Not really, ItzAwesome is still there
its pretty much the same
People are just petty for itsawesome but he cant even run a host correctly to be honest yk
eraters - Pamar started muting / banning people for posting a "gay" picture, Which is rasism.
what
deleted - eraters mom im TV
eraters - what
Jedrik - Alr so apparently Falix staff started using bot clients and will be releasing a public bot for Tickets for everyone to use ;) Big risk for servers that'll use this bot

Also yes I know Huss is making the bot and Chimken owns this bot but they're all Falix staff, these the peeps you trusting to provide you a bot?

Here's why bot clients are a risk or shouldn't be used:

Against Discord TOS
User logged in to the bot can do whatever on your server, provided that you gave them high-level permissions, basically they become an admin - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-09-21/1600726696-676115-screenshot-2020-09-22-06-16-17-85.jpeg
Jedrik - Jedrik ik unrelated to the host, but it's still under their name ;)
Deleted User - Hm
Deleted User - Jedrik i like how i got warned and then kicked (or banned i didn t check if i was banned) for pinging exoticalcat (he let s me ping him). - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-09-25/1601028339-239550-image.png
Deleted User - mituishere - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-09-25/1601029149-110858-screenshot-2020-09-25-11-18-36-45.jpeg
Deleted User - Wow even the bots are against you
Deleted User - Jeekie still, the point is that exotical have no problems with me pinging him, as this was a personal prefference if u let ppl to ping u or not.
Deleted User - yes

conclusion: backup your files because they are not gonna when they will remove them - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-09-25/1601042493-137092-image.png
QwipticxDev - This place is a joke tbh.
eraters - so am i
TFSxADVITH - Someone tell me everything about old falix
Deleted User - Yes, very professional FalixNodes Staff. They came into easly to talk about their thingies, and they flexed about their "Backup system" - Not gonna fix my grammar.

I got no answer from Huss for my question. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-09-29/1601369186-123615-image.png
AYS - mituishere I already said, over 11k members in our discord, staff can't remember who each member can ping, etc. You can't ping any of our staff members
Deleted User - AYS What...? I was talking about the "Backup System"
Deleted User - You all got a taste of your own medicine. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-09-29/1601379909-402036-image.png

Bear - mituishere We muted you for causing Drama, 
and you were kicked for Repeated Lying and Spamming + Causing Drama
We gave you a chance to challenge our decision as well 

But Easly Banned me
No Appeals , No Warns , No mutes , A direct Ban
I dont really wanna make this a Easly Thread 
Guess Their Kid Staff Could Not Hold my Opinions, huh?
Deleted User - Bear Nah I got muted, then kicked, then banned without using the bot - so  I get no reason in my DMs for the ban i got. So I think FalixNodes can't Handle the truth. Wait, actually, I got banned 2 times, one time for reporting Oliver's mistakes. and another one for the truth that FalixNodes couldn't handle. So they just gave you a taste from FalixNodes staff medicine.
AYS - mituishere Just a reminder for YOU, user who OWNS DISCORD SERVER can ban whoever they want even if they don't have a reason. Thanks.
Deleted User - mituishere bot had a bug when the bans didn't send DM messages the second time
Deleted User - AYS (i m talking about the message you sent, not an answer for what you said) Bear you heard it? The same things will apply to you too.
JosieV - Applicable to services like FalixNodes, QuackHost, etc...
When will people understand the fact that you don't get things for FREE !! ??? If you use google or any other major search engines, you won't find any websites providing you the facilities Falix offers you. Its a blunt lie. Major engines such as google, microsoft, amazon, etc doesn't even provide more than 1 GB Ram for free FYI. There is no such thing called free vps ( Refer Here ). The income from arc.io doesn't compensate the outcome charges of these services. Even if their exists free vps, there are a lot of limitations on them, heroku and glitch are the prefect examples in this case. Falix isnt listed in google if you search unless for "Falix hosting" or "falix nodes".  So if falix offers you way better features than any of the web gaints can provide and that too for free, Everything they say, literally the whole thing is a hoax, a complete lie OR its provides you stolen services using loopholes in many other major hosting servers, which is completely illegal. Now if you're using this service, and you dont even care if they are illegal, you are a victim of the "Social Dilemma". These people might be selling your data, literally the virtual you,  to have an income. Services like these are started by unemployed brilliant people, for a means of life.  
For gad sake, try to understand whats true rather than selling yourself as a slave. This documentary Here on netflix will put some sense into your head if you dont understand how are these people manipulating/tricking you into traps the they are offering you. You might not mind selling your the very virtual you for your current needs, but you're risking a whole lot of things that you'll need to hang on to live in the future. Its easy to throw off these paragraph using the usual excuses of having no proof. The proof that works here is your common sense and the power to understand things in a different angle when things go wrong /and whats reality. It would be wise not to turn a blind eye to the truth rather than to do so since their offer is literally everything u have to have your bot hosted. Learn to say NO to scammers. Defending these people would be the ones who are/will be offered more of the scammed lots by the owners. Turning against scammers is always risky for as your data is with them, form a community, stand strong against them, and thats how humanity has lived so far. I'm not a professional critic or something, its just the simple truth you people forget to think about when you see glitter amongst the desert.

"You are lying, we have tos &amp; privacy policy, its not worth the risk" People are clever enough these days to exploit/to have loopholes in it to get pass through

And no, i'm not a hater of these services. Read again and again until you understand why its written.
Deleted User - You have literally no idea what your talking about
Deleted User - We don't offer free VPS, AdSense and arc gets us enough money to cover costs and we have additional income coming in. Just as you said you have no proof, and as a matter of fact free minecraft hosting is very easy to do.
Deleted User - Oh I can't find anything - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-09-30/1601497116-944933-screenshot-2020-09-30-21-18-17-34.jpeg
Deleted User - This is Minecraft hosting, not vps's what are you talking about
Deleted User - Discord IDs and emails must really be falixnodes taking over the world
JosieV - I'm talking about discord bot hosting, nothing else
Deleted User - Discord bot hosting is practically the same as mc
KejiDiscord - So do u think falixnodes is accessing their clients private info through their email and discord linking?
JosieV - Never said Discord Oauth is stupid enough to do that. People stay idle on your websites You've no idea about the info websites can fetch from you.
AYS - JosieV arc.io didn't give enough revenue? In the best days you can even profit like 500$ a month if you know what you are doing. + google adsense, join for resources, patreons, discord ads. You are very very wrong here.
Deleted User - JosieV privacy policy exists
Jedrik - JosieV Yes please uninstall everything from  your device, burn all your gadgets in your house, all of them take data from you
Bear - JosieV dude do you have any idea what you are talking about?
Discord Bot Hosting is literally so same as mc hosting
First of all, We do not provide VPS for free 
2nd We allot you server containers with limits to host your discord bot or mc server
Bear - JosieV Please Stop Using Google, Netflix or any internet services
Please Disconnect yourself from the internet
Talking about Discord Oauth, Stop using the famous bots like mee6 and others which requires you have logged in with Discord Oauth
And You can actually see what Falixnodes access from Your Discord Account and What Not
xCrystalz_ - FalixNodes, known as the bad Free Host. Has AWFUL Support Staff. When I joined their discord and was trying to help them by making them tutorials. One of their support staff, found my YouTube, thought I was lying about being 13+ WHICH I AM 13+ and then found my OLD tiktok from my YouTube and using it to get me banned even though im 13+. He then sent it all around the FalixNodes discord and my friends until everyone there had pretty much seen my face.
Cian - xCrystalz_ 1 question - can I please see the tiktok?
AYS - xCrystalz_ can you send the username who did it?
Jedrik - AYS Someone's getting demoted today 👀
Ryder - And yeah don't forget to send the tiktok
AYS - Jedrik yep
AYS - talked with staff, one said that he sent to only one staff member, let's wait for the second one
AYS - You never got banned, you left. This is a lie
Ryder - Scammmmmm!!!!
Chicken - xCrystalz_ I talked with the staff team, one staff member found your YouTube channel and said your voice sounds young/under 13 so they requested you to confirm your age as you must be 13+ to use discord, (said in Discord's TOS). You also must be 13+ to use our services, as said in our User Agreement. Staff were suspicious of your voice as it sounded under 13 so they asked you to confirm your age.


xCrystalz_ He then sent it all around the FalixNodes discord
  
I searched your name using Discord's built-in search feature, no links/files from TikTok appeared, there's literally only 1 message containing your name.

If you could provide me with the username and userID of the staff member, I'll take a further look.


xCrystalz_ using it to get me banned
  
You were never banned, I checked the logs, you left the server, no one banned you.

Nothing shows you being banned, I only covered up the responsible moderator.

If you tell me the username of the staff member, I can take a further look. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-10-03/1601767030-343398-image.png

If you tell me the username of the staff member, I can take a further look. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-10-03/1601767609-52657-image.png
xCrystalz_ - I never said I was banned but they USED the thing to get me banned.
   Also I changed my username to something else soo ye
Toki0179 - xCrystalz_ im pretty sure if u change ur username that ur id stays the same
Jedrik - xCrystalz_ So where's the tiktok? The staff member's username? Anything???
Withdrawal - xCrystalz_ 

Changing your username doesn't mean anything. The discord id stays the same, so in this situation you are lying.
Chicken - xCrystalz_ You're literally accusing the staff team of doing something without providing ANY proof, where's the TikTok? What's the proof of this happening? What's the staff member's username? 

Just provide proof to back up your claims.
Chicken - xCrystalz_ 

I never said I was banned but they USED the thing to get me banned
  
  How does this make sense, you just said you were never banned, I never said I was banned, but now you said you got banned.... USED the thing to get me banned.
  
  So whats going on?
leastile - xCrystalz_ idiot what do u even mean
MagaDragon_ - I am not sure whether FalixNodes is safe. Although they are already registered companies and say that advertising revenue is very sufficient and they can buy new nodes in the future, I think they are very good free hosting providers. I don't know about security.
RektorDK - Well now i got banned for "abusing" a J4R rule that wasnt even said to me.


And saying that he will make announcement to leave my server.


And then saying i scammed, but in reality he scammed me because there were no rules for it, and i had my ad until 15 october. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-10-10/1602365056-757917-falixproof1.png

Deleted User - Few days (or weeks) ago, I looked up at JFR channel, and maybe saw something like a J4R server got removed because of something. Is that yours?
Jedrik - RektorDK Just a thought, do you know what rule you broke?
leastile - wait what rule did he broke
Pamar - RektorDK You got banned for breaking join for resources rules which was said in your ticket when you purchased the join for resources spot (why you dont say about you were aware of rules?), including the rule "You are not allowed to advertise free hosting or paid hosting without any additional cost or manual review by me.

You purchased the ad spot when your discord server was other topic (not free hosting) and now you switched it to free hosting which breaks join for resources rules.

So yea you got banned for breaking j4r rules AND destroying people safety (since your free host deleted all people servers files with 1 hour backup notice without any further option to get files back etc)
Withdrawal - leastile He/she broke a jfr rule

J0SH - bans me for talking about the jfr thing lmao - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-10-24/1603563601-239107-image.png
Jpaul - Banned by a 12 yr old kid. *facepalm. insert"

Falixnodes ads is bigger than the server list lmao. also wtf falix did just deleted my whole minecraft server for no reason? lol i work like 3 months for it then they just deleted it. *facepalm again.

dont use falix lol falix is just FreeMC v3 lol 
then would probably just delete ur server for no reason. 

falix sux...
i just waste my life being simp on falix lol. staff on falix is soo shit immature *(not all lol) - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-10-24/1603563878-369994-image.png
Pamar - J0SH not even falix staff..? how its related to falix?
Pamar - Jpaul nope, we dont have any 12 years old staff, you doubt here.

also wtf falix did just deleted my whole minecraft server for no reason? lol i work like 3 months for it then they just deleted it. *facepalm again.

We never delete any servers unless You were inactive for 14 days (which can be also caused by discord ban) or you are breaking our ToS such as using leaked plugins which harm FalixNodes overall.
Deleted User - Pamar I am the only one that remembers Oliver or what...?

If it wasn't Cat, Oliver was still in there lol, because guess what, Pamar doesn't gives a fuck about falixnodes staff. He (Pamar) just wants money to go on trips and to buy real-life objects,
Jpaul - Pamar 
most popular files deleter in the planet* (bruh) - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-10-24/1603568789-440610-image.png

Deleted User - Jpaul 

File Yeeter* Yeetus deletus.
Jpaul - mituishere oh shit.
Deleted User - Jpaul They have this section in the TOS 

I think they added it because if anyone is gonna get his files deleted by i child from their staff team or by pamar himself, they will say "cuz i can" and they will take it as a required action to do. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-10-24/1603569515-841826-image.png
Deleted User - also this lmao



so if u say falixnodes bad, pamar will get triggered and remove ur files with the reason of losing customers LMAO WHAT A KID :)))))) - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-10-24/1603569752-506438-image.png
Deleted User - mituishere And also if you are going to say this is not true, i'm waiting the files from my vps.
Deleted User - mituishere your VPS was removed because you breached your contract with us. Should of thought about it before you broke the contract
Jedrik - Technically isn't your vps
Pamar - mituishere First of all, oliw3r (or whatever his nickname is) and oliver are different persons, and once again oliw3r never was/is not staff of falixnodes
Pamar - Jpaul saying without proofs, cool thing to do, sure.
Pamar - mituishere its because we can suspend someone account if we are sure they are doing something not the best which compiles with our user agreement, we not gonna delete files or servers without any reason bruh
Pamar - mituishere it literally says IF YOU HOST CRYPTOCURRENCY MINING ETC, it does not mean "if you say something bad to falix, your server and files will be removed"
AYS - "If it wasn't Cat, Oliver was still in there lol, because guess what, Pamar doesn't gives a fuck about falixnodes staff. He (Pamar) just wants money to go on trips and to buy real-life objects," Pamar invests his own money to falixnodes not the other way around, if he wants profit why the fuck would he purchase more nodes, he can just stack all the servers on 3 free nodes.
Deleted User - Pamar i said Oliver and not Oliw3r.
Deleted User - Jeekie The part of that "Contract" Was about Pamar providing a VPS. I choose to get the VPS from FalixNodes instead of any providers. So I don't see what rule I broke from the ToS...? I should've stuck to any other hosting, so my files would not get removed.

The VPS I was supposed to get was from Contabo. But I wanted to be a good guy and buy it from FalixNodes.


The "Contract" doesn't say anything that my VPS will get REMOVED if I will start trash talking. He just says that he will provide me a VPS. So you, literally deleted my files, without any announcement of doing that and there is no rule in the ToS that I broke so my VPS will get removed. So you are the same guy, that was in the past. You just want some money to satisfy your needs, you don't give a fuck about our files, or your customers. So you are the same trash guy that you've were. People never change. So everyone that is reading this post, be aware of your files. Backup them every minute you can, because they can get deleted by any staff member, or even ItzAwesome himself, without any reason. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-10-25/1603619487-192088-image.png
Deleted User - Pamar Then where are my files?
Deleted User - AYS Yah, nodes that are almost every time broken. What about the nitro he had and bought for people? Don't tell me that the thing he did that was kindness because he was just buying people, so no one would hate him for what he did in the past.
Deleted User - Here is the proof of the VPS that he wanted to give me was from Contabo. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-10-25/1603620073-939234-image.png
Deleted User - mituishere however, you broke your partnership contract with falixnodes, not lamaker. We had full rights to do what we did. If you notice, every single one of our paying customers did not loose anything.
Deleted User - Jeekie LMAO WHERE IT S SAYING THAT U HAVE THE RIGHTS TO REMOVE MY VPS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MONTH :))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))
Deleted User - Jeekie Nah, just a donator got banned a few months ago, he didn't lost anything 100%
Deleted User - mituishere he did not loose his VPS, correct
Deleted User - mituishere https://falixnodes.net/terms-and-conditions.php
Deleted User - mituishere https://stats.uptimerobot.com/vDgp8hWo5z "almost every time broken"
Deleted User - Jeekie There is no rule in the ToS that says you can remove my vps without a reason.
Deleted User - Jeekie Daemon be dying every day tho.
Pamar - mituishere Nop, once I applied my daemon fix, there are no issues with it.
Pamar - also jeekie what linked is daemon uptime
Deleted User - mituishere - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-10-25/1603621136-60001-screenshot-20201025-121342-chrome.jpeg
Deleted User - Pamar u said that more than 30 times in a month.
Deleted User - Jeekie "If we count that is required to do", don't see the reason for deleting my files. Did u add that so you can have fun with people files?
ItsYaBoyBanana - mituishere all hosts have that but oke
Pamar - mituishere you are not even using or being in falixnodes, in what time i even said 30 times in this month?
Pamar - I have script which catches the daemon error from wings logs, if it catches them it restarts the daemon, it also have auto restart daemon each 30 minutes, if you see daemon error in falix, show me it, go ahead.
Deleted User - Pamar I said in A month, not in THIS month.
Pamar - mituishere ah, lover of telling past stuff
Deleted User - Pamar maybe u stole that and uploaded to blackspigot too, who knows.
Deleted User - Pamar ah, lover of yeeting people's files.
Pamar - mituishere I asked so much many times for proof of me uploading anything (not counting ptero script) in blackspigot, did i got the response? Oh no, i wait for 3 or more months, still nothing... also, its my script bruh
Pamar - mituishere sure, prove it then talk.
Deleted User - mituishere reason, you weren't paying and you, as a partner trash talked falixnodes. Once you Lost that partnership, you lost the vps
Deleted User - Jeekie I didn't get any perk as being a partner lmao. I had the partner rank because of the falixnodes event that was killed by the trash performance of your nodes. You don't even know the reason y you deleted my VPS. You just were bored and wanted to delete some files I think.
Deleted User - Pamar 
The proofs I sent above with the "contract" - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-10-25/1603622082-831901-image.png
Deleted User - Jeekie Also my VPS got deleted in the middle of the month after Pamar "paid" for the VPS that he had to provide. Also, I didn't get any email that my VPS will be closed, or I have an invoice to pay.
Deleted User - mituishere how is that proof? A screenshot of jpaul saying that

Cough this is also jpaul - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-10-25/1603622551-161635-screenshot-2020-10-25-09-49-41-23.jpeg
Deleted User - mituishere doesn't matter when it was, falixnodes had full rights to terminate your service
Deleted User - Jeekie ?? What's with that? I don't think that's a thing that has to do with the random removal of the VPS.
Deleted User - Jeekie nope. it doesn't because there was no valid reason to do that.
Deleted User - mituishere the reason why your VPS was removed was because you breached your contract with falixnodes, not lamaker.
Deleted User - mituishere - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-10-25/1603622829-67621-screenshot-2020-10-25-10-46-56-46.jpeg
Deleted User - Jeekie I had no contract with falixnodes.
Deleted User - mituishere when you got a VPS with us, no matter if it was through lamaker or not a contract was created
Deleted User - Jeekie and I still don't find what is related to the picture I sent. If you want to know about what logo we were talking about. There is a host that uses a logo 90% similar to another host, and we were joking about it.
Deleted User - mituishere I'm talking about someone's who's saying "let's raid it" to a host, yet a discord picture of him saying words is apparently proof
Deleted User - Jeekie and what was the contract saying? Also, I want a copy of that contract. And if it's not signed, it's not my business, as I have to "sign" the contract.
Deleted User - Jeekie we were talking about it as a joke...? And again, i still don't see the wire that connects the photo you sent and the photo i sent.
Jpaul - Jeekie nah, i mean on raid. is to we should join all. and btw we didnt raid that discord server. i was joking at that time bruh for u!
Deleted User - Jeekie Also y I didn't get the contract into an email?
ItsYaBoyBanana - mituishere https://client.falixnodes.net/UserAgreement.pdf
Deleted User - mituishere as soon as you sign up to falixnodes, you agree to our TOS. In our TOS it says you must abide to https://client.falixnodes.net/UserAgreement.pdf  - we did not need to email you this.
ItsYaBoyBanana - Jpaul is it your idea of professionalism to put a full stop after every other word
ItsYaBoyBanana - Jeekie told me to say these cuz he couldn't access to the website before btw
Deleted User - Jeekie And still, where is the valid reason for removing my files, without announcing me?
Deleted User - mituishere please use your eyes and read. There are multiple lines in the user agreement.
Deleted User - Jeekie 
I'm waiting for 10 euros then. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-10-25/1603623963-627786-image.png
Deleted User - mituishere they would be refunded to lamaker, not you as you got it through him
Pamar - mituishere transaction id :kappalul:
Deleted User - ItsYaBoyBanana 
that was the logo we were talking about if you really want to know. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-10-25/1603624064-532721-image.png
Deleted User - Jeekie The contract and the account was made with my email in it. Not with ItzAwesome's name.
Deleted User - Pamar ":kappalul:", yes, the professionalism of a falixnodes staff member.
Deleted User - mituishere alright, transaction id so I can issue a refund.
Pamar - mituishere Oh, so let's talk about other hosting staff members and owners which uses kappa emojis
Deleted User - Jeekie That's the proof Pamar haves to give me every month that he didn't. So you need to ask him about that.

Here is the proof of owning the VPS. The censured part it's my email. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-10-25/1603624485-700816-image.png
Deleted User - mituishere the payment would be refunded. This would mean it would go to lamaker, not you as he paid. If I paid for your hosting service and then you wanted a refund, you wouldn't get the money back, I would.
Deleted User - mituishere please attempt to use your brain
Deleted User - Me? Lmao, read your ToS  I don't think my VPS was on Pamar's account, and also, he had to give me the money to pay for the VPS.


"tomorrow gonna send u money
10 euro"



another proof of him having to send me the money to get the vps. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-10-25/1603624859-89924-image.png

Deleted User - mituishere if he sent it to you, where is your transaction id.
Deleted User - Jeekie r u dumb, can't u read the last line...?
Jedrik - Jeekie If I paid for your hosting service and then you wanted a refund, you wouldn't get the money back, I would.
Deleted User - Jedrik that's the point u don't understand, he had to give me the money, so I can pay for the VPS by myself, but he didn't, and he didn't even give me proof of buying it. So he broke the "CONTRACT" before i did.
Deleted User - And also, I didn't break any of the terms from the TOS and the User Agreement.

 

The contract I had with Pamar haves no biding between falixnodes and pamar, it was only about trashing him and falix, in the result of doing that, I would not get money to buy the VPS anymore, but still, I didn't get asked if I was gonna pay for the vps anymore, and i got no email for an upcoming invoice, like any other hosting services. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-10-25/1603626441-233644-image.png
Deleted User - mituishere Idgaf about the money, I just want my files. the point of this is about ItzAwesome removing files, servers, and other services, without any valid reason, as my VPS was removed without any reason, as the contract I had with the VPS it's between me and itzawesome, not me and falixnodes.
AYS - Please read our legal documents again, we have full rights to suspend or terminate your account and files and servers if "we want to"
Deleted User - AYS Ok, so you just confirmed that you all are playing with ppl files. If anyone is reading this, here is the reason you don't need to use falixnodes.
AYS - mituishere what are you talking about? We don't delete files just randomly, you broke a contract and thats why it happened.
Deleted User - AYS The contract was not about removing my files if I broke it.
AYS - mituishere Yes but if you break our contract why would we keep your vps when we have other customers who want to purchase a vps?
Deleted User - AYS As I said, the contract was not about removing my files if I broke it.
AYS - mituishere yes but if you broke the contract why would we keep your files when we have other people who need a vps?
J0SH - Pamar you were talking about it
Deleted User - AYS At least announce to me that you are gonna remove my files? lmao
INfoUpgraders - So is FalixNodes bad then?
Jedrik - INfoUpgraders 
Well technically they did state that they can delete your files if they had a decent enough reason to do so, @mituishere's files got deleted cause he broke his partnership with FalixNodes and started being toxic to both the Falix community and Falix staff team,

But then again Falix having stated that they can delete your files whenever they want to is basically like use falix at your own risk lmao anyway both of them are at fault here, mitu shouldn't have been such a toxic partner and falix should have at least warned him so he could perform a backup

For your question 

INfoUpgraders is FalixNodes bad then?

I mean they're definitely changing and actually have a budget, actual nodes, and actual staff now, but that doesn't mean they're clear
Mocab - Jen dont say thing u dont know falix is the best the only reason u think its bad is cause some people dont follow the rules
Mocab - mituishere they remove it every 13 days IF YOU DONT LOGIN INTO PANEL
Jen - Mocab Brah stop the cap, U is funny, You ofc think a host thats closed multiple times is sooo good
And a guy that has done soo much fraud
And u praise him like he's done more than freemc.host
Which ad least he provides an actual good host
Pamar - Jen fraud? Ok, first list them and post evidence to it, I am waiting. I didn't thought registering legal UK company to pay for tax is fraud ah also I did not knew paying for bills and stuff is also fraud etc etc etc

QwipticxDev - Hello People
Toki0179 - I believe lamaker is paying exo below minimum wage. The reason I have for believing this is when I asked lamaker about it he just said "well falix is poor" and basically avoided the question - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-01-22/1611327829-621716-discord-kcswfaazch.png
Jedrik - Toki0179 Mostly keeps Falix's earnings to himself, spends it on random shit such as discord nitro, then says Falix's earnings go back to Falix and he makes no earnings

Jedrik - Ash777 all money into paying bill and saving

He does use it to pay for bills but he spends it on random shit, "Earnings go to falix", "It's my hobby"
Pamar - Jedrik random shit? Sometimes I help people paying for their bills, gifting stuff etc and you call it random shit? Like fr few mins ago I gave some money to Cat cuz he had bill lmaoo - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-01-23/1611396928-638667-image.png
Pamar - and what about other times when cat needed money for bills and other people too? And what about the moment when someone gave me 500 quid without saying i need to payback it and I am paybacking it?
Pamar - Jedrik in october i had project where i was earning money but it died, please use more up to date info rather than past
Deleted User - Ah so everyone, here is an example of how kind lamaker is. When someone makes shitty financial decisions and lands themselves in almost bankruptcy, you'd think they would be grateful when someone else comes in out of the blue and gives them money so that they A) can stay in a hotel and B) can keep their project alive. But no, they have to act like even though now they have the money for it, its sUcH a BiG bUrDeN tO pAy BaCk. They constantly go on about how they are poor and lie about where their money goes. Lamaker your status 3 days ago "just gifted 3 people nitros feeling good". Wow, money not randomly spent. Lamaker if you dont stop going on about you paying me back after me saving falix from falling apart i will say alot more stuff that you would rather wouldnt go public so i advise you to shut the fuck up
Pamar - Jeekie my point was about I could have easily not paid back, I appreciate for your help in the past and I am happy to payback, and I never wanted to mention anything about it - only said that I am doing something like that.
Pamar - In addition, maybe I spend some money from MY WAGE on nitros or some useless stuff, though it is not falix money but my allowance which I spend on irl bills, food, other stuff

Deleted User - Pamar No you don't so please be quiet. You brag on about it every fucking day. The only reason you're paying back is because you're worried ill winterhoax you for everything i know about you. Its not because you're a nice person. What about mario? Without him you would never of managed to make falix. The problem i have with you is you always act like falix was 100% made by you which is fucking bullshit. Without me and mario falix wouldn't exist, and you should accept that.
Deleted User - Pamar i GeT nO mOnEy fRoM fAliX spends 100s on food and nitro every month
Pamar - Jeekie Yesterday someone said to me in my dms about I am so good cuz I made falixnodes, but in return I have said about without many of people I couldn't make it alive, I am even in public sometimes saying about without mario, jeekie and other people it couldnt be possible. And no, I am appreciate on paying back and for your help, I really dont brag about it
Deleted User - Whenever you make a assumption or joke its fine, but whenever someone else does e.g. jedrik right now you suddenly jump on saying oH tHaTs A lIe
Pamar - Jeekie I publicly in announcement have announced about I have wage which I collect from FalixNodes
Pamar - Just, @Jeekie , because you say anything to me remember about our friendship since 2018 (freemc ig), you think i dont care about you helped me etc?
Deleted User - Pamar Alright lets see that shall we? If you don't brag about it you wouldn't mention it in this thread. Keep me out of your bullshit lamaker or i will come in with my own stuff. I've kept everything i know quiet, do you not want that? How hard is it to keep your mouth shut? Answer that question? If its about me then just don't say it. I've had this conversation with you on discord around 3 times. Enough is enough.
Deleted User - Pamar I never see you appreciating anything i did, and im sure hardly anyone else has either, so dont say oh i always appreciated what you did

Bear - Jeekie Well, No Doubt on the ending statement (Without me and mario falix wouldn't exist) of your comment.
But don't you think, this is getting all off topic of what the forum is about?
Ash777 - Bear well ya this forum is bit off topic (as there is no topic left)
Deleted User - Bear perfectly on topic?
Deleted User - Ash777 just stop simping for lamaker already holy
Deleted User - Bear I'm trying to tell lamaker something, and the people that know understand
Ash777 - Jeekie not simping just sharing my opinion
Ash777 - well not totally related to this forum but are these forums supposed to be updated ? like the tags ?
Jedrik - Ash777 They're still VERY accurate 😉
Bear - Jeekie i understand and respect that
eraters - ItsYaBoyBanana  PANIK
Ash777 - Jedrik the bad support tag is atleast not accurate
Jedrik - candy We admire your courage to come out as braindead, we support you and will always be here for you.
Ash777 - well @Sloth i think some of the tags need to be updated
Ash777 - candy i agree
Abooz - Best of all, log in into their panel then look into your discord server list. BOOM you are in 20 random servers you never joined!

Sorry sorry but he uses the money for PRIVATE SCHOOL.
Well, money can't teach him how to count lmao

At least the counting is better than the nodes lmao.



Here are some stats he put on his discord server



Also a fact:
Working without a contract and getting paid in Romania is illegal I think.
He and his workers can get sued for like 2k euro per worker I think - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-01-28/1611831937-102045-image.png

Deleted User - Jeekie nahnahnah it's private school
Deleted User - Jeekie yo don't forget about that he got a new phone from Falixnodes money
The A20s he got for 200 euro was from Arc money lol
Deleted User - ItsYaBoyBanana Nah I'm alive. I've been focused on high school to get that scholarship lol.
Waiting for our semestrial grade so I will know if I will get it or not, It will be like 100RON/mo. After some calculus, I'm gonna get like 160 euro at the end of this school year.

@Pamar - also that's a way to get money for free without being illegal lmao
Pamar - Ok.

But in serious way, why would someone even care if their host is in winterhoax? Does it affect anything? No, it is too small community of exposers to share the truthfully (there even was a lot of cases when lies was posted in here), like what's point of this? I was happy to be part of winterhoax to expose few hosts however it's my time when I leave this shit place. I won't lie about PART of thread is truth, however not everything of it is, but I do not care, people have choice between trusting me or this thread. So cya - this is my last message in here, if anyone gonna try to winterhoax me, I won't even probably notice that or even care about it. This place became that shit, there is no point of being here.

Now cya, you can try to dm me about winterhoax or spam winterhoax links in FalixNodes, however you will either be blocked or muted.
Deleted User - Pamar X2 ^^
Deleted User - Pamar Cry about it in ur private school :)) (If any of ur friends care (if you have any friends)). Also, before talking, learn how to count lmao.

The chat was spamming y their servers are lag when I joined on ur discord server
Rating of 3.7 on Trustpilot
  Here are 2 interesting 1-star ratings: 


 (So u racist, as u blacklisted a whole country)


What did I reach?
Semestrial grade: 9.16/10 (18 classes general grade divided with 18)
This brings me like 160 euro every year without scamming people, as you did in the past, only if I keep my semestrial grade above 8.50 
Next month we might be learning Android Development - another reason y am focussing on my studies.
If I will get almost the same grade at the BACCALAUREATE I think that I can go to the greatest IT university in my country. (A guy that was into that university, is working at Google now)
  
But here is a thing. I get free money just bcs of learning
You pay money to learn.

You did this host only for the way of income, as you SCAMMED people, for your "hobby - not a way of income" (as you call it) If it was a hobby, then u weren't supposed to go to hotels with ur family, have an A20s or even the phone you had now, nitro, and etc.

If this was your "hobby" then y didn't you invest in FalixNodes? Y didn't you bought new nodes? These nodes are literally the same nodes from 3/4 months ago.
You almost went bankrupt. ExoticalCat saved you multiple times.   

So this is not a hobby, this sounds to me more like your PRINCIPAL way of income. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-01-30/1612022047-933191-image.png

Be calm and enjoy that Falixnodes is free not paid. 
and honestly did u even try it now in 2021?

I bet u didn't. Because i've been using it for 6 months and It seems like a good hosting.

Now stfu if u don't have evidence and if u didn't, then try it.

Goodbye...
Deleted User - LogicApples Lmao (toxic kid), enjoy what?

...The trash quality?
...Getting my files removed without any reason?

Why should I try it if I already know how bad it is (also have confirmation from the ratings from TrustPilot - 3.6 ratings, it was 3.7 two days before)?
Why should I try it if I already know that they can delete my files without any valid reason?

This literally shows us that staff can delete our files without any reason. So this host it's a use it on your risk type of host.

Ash777 As I knew, you are one of the Pamar's dogs team. Let's read the last review together if you know how to.


Nothing changed from the day I left until now.

Also, @Ash777, what prizes did they got for doing that? I can still remember in 2019 summer that if you made a good review, you would get free resources. - another reason to not trust FalixNodes 

But no, no, everyone has their own opinion... although if you say something bad you can get punished for "spreading false information"

Also, let's don't forget how many times Pamar got saved from bankruptcy by @Jeekie and @ExoticalCat.
Why? He bought himself new phones, he went on vacations with his family, he bought ppl nitro. - All of these things bought from FalixNodes money. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-02-03/1612358462-861954-image.png

Toki0179 - mituishere lmfao oliver was the best nglll lmfaooo he literally abused all his perms 24/7
Toki0179 - LogicApples its not a good host :| the only reason its still running is because of the amount of scams lamaker has ran to fund it also because of exo cat and the exploits they used to get free nodes or gain money from arc...
Deleted User - Toki0179 Nah, leave the toxic kid alone, he wanna copy the staff team so he can be a member of the Pamar's dogs team too.

Cat had to demote him
Pamar didn't want to demote him so he would not be going to post in here. That's the main reason he doesn't demote staff.

Chirag - Bxrk how tf is that not NSFW?
explain
It has the n word
Suck my d**k is NSFW
Please get your eyes checked again.
Chirag - Bxrk that's not an OFFICIAL server, there is a difference between a community server and an official server.
Also, let's just say, you had also banned me when I just said, 'your 8 gb ram Ionos vps is so overloaded' in your host (Summer hosting) you just have all servers + pterodactyl on 1 single 8 gb ram vps, with a Xeon CPU...
Bxrk - Chirag o i didnt even watch the whole video lmao
Bxrk - Chirag why u like just because we are on fasthosts what the fuck
Chirag - Bxrk That makes 0 sense
Bxrk - Chirag we are using fasthosts that gives you an excuse to lie about us on a 8gb vps LMAO

Bxrk - damn someone's trying to protect falix 😂😂
Bxrk - Chirag no?
Chirag - Bxrk it's your god damn host, bruh, and that's actual ram usage and swap usage
Bxrk - Chirag so your point?
Chirag - Bxrk stop lieing that you have a better vps, and stop banning people who say that in your discord (yes you banned me and you blocked me on discord) lmao
Bxrk - Chirag this is a falixnodes thread wtf and i blocked you because you stan falixnodes
Bxrk - blocked and banned *

I want evidence of you not leaking Tommy's script.
I want evidence of you not abusing the IONOS payment system, the reason for the most data losses
I want evidence of you not nuking nodes.
I want evidence of you not being ItzAwesome, as you kept saying that you aren't in the past.
Sloth - The conversation about his fake depression ends here. The purpose of him doing all of this is to, as you probably already know, gather attention, which you are feeding him just by talking about it. I'd suggest ignoring him being emo, and someday he'll come to terms with the fact that him broadcasting his fake depression to thousands of people in his Discord server probably isn't the best of ideas, in a community perspective, but who knows with this kid, he is so indecisive and pretentious it is unbelievable. Changing names, creating hosts, lying about the simplest of things, bragging to thousands of people about his "e-relationship".
stop
Either run your shitty host(s) like you're doing right now, and it'll end up the deep end in a not very long amount of time. You're highly unprofessional and incapable to do anything right. Sloth out.

Pamar - mituishere learn hetrixtools next time. 

Short Answer:

Because a HeartBeat Uptime Monitor has only one point of failure, which is your server’s ability to send data to our platform, unlike all of the other Uptime Monitor types where your monitored target is checked from different geo-locations around the world. So, with a HeartBeat Uptime Monitor, if at any time for any reason your server is unable to send data to our platform, your Uptime Monitor will be declared as being offline even if your server may not actually be down.

(this is reason why I'm slowly switching to grafana)

Pamar - mituishere are you being racism to other countries?
ely - mituishere So it's just possible to be racist to Indonesia? I don't see your point in talking about racism in just blocking access countries to avoid problems with the amount of access, something that many companies do.
Deleted User - ely I don't see Indonesia in the list you've sent me.
Chirag - Google restricts access to some of its business services (like YouTube, Gmail, Blogger, Maps) in certain countries or regions, such as Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, Syria and almost all Arab countries.
So @mituishere, google is racist?
Ash777 - i think @mituishere should stop using google now as google is racist
Pamar - Ash777 yeah, google, Microsoft and a lot of other companies like stripe, and a lot of other multi million revenue companies are restricting their services to certain countries (even paypal), so sadly he can't pay in any website with his card or PayPal, he can't search with google and use google services like YouTube and gmail and then Microsoft too and so on
Pamar - mitu be like "omg this website uses PayPal and stripe as card? hell no I'm not paying here, they are so racism, hold up they even use google login system? EWWWW"
Pamar - sorry for too much posts but I also remembered that Samsung restricted a lot of countries from Samsung pay, Samsung members and a lot of their services, so he should say Samsung is racism

DeadBush - mituishere If you see it that way then OMG we all are discussing only in English and not other languages we all are so racist. Omg WinterHoax page design and stuff is wrote in English and not other languages WinterHoax is racist ban them. 
Spotify is not available in all countries and then
@mituishere be like- omg let's cancel spotify cuz I just lost to a kid in Bedwars and need to get excuses to take my anger off. Oh wait let's go to WinterHoax and try to post whatever I can even though no one cares.
Pamar - DeadBush oh boi I totally agree on that one
Ash777 - DeadBush agreed
DeadBush - @mituishere dude you seriously have no life. You reply to threads so quickly unless u sleeping. Get a life and let other's get too. You have no job and your life is a joke dosen't mean others are same too. You are acting so unmatured here 90% of you replies makes no sense or makes a bit sense.
You make homophobic jokes too so can I say that you are discriminative towards LGBTQ? Well I do make sometimes joke on that too. All i wanted to say is Everyone's pov is not the same. And assuming something without thinking what others think is just shit.
Deleted User - DeadBush I like how y'all, falixnodes dogs/kissasses, started talking about me for blaming him for being racist (what he is, for literally giving no other reason for y did he ban them) 🙂)

But why no one is talking about this?


The fact that he warned me for "gay pictures" and then him fake-coming out as an lgbtq+ member doesn't save his ass. He is still a homophobe that used the come-out as a door for saving his ass. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-03-21/1616336318-629182-image.png
Deleted User - I've realized that I'm consuming my time on this shit, instead of being productive. Sooner or later, this will still get sued by anyone, and then get closed.
Deleted User - As I can see, every falixnodes kissass started spawning in here, protecting their mighty dad. Y'all just try to solve shit in here, but everyone knows that y'all are just some staff and that y'all simp on Pamar/Lamaker/ItzAwesome/Lily or what name does he have at this moment. History is history, and nothing can change that. He already warned me for "gay picture" =&gt; homophobe, he already scammed me in the past and nothing can be changed.
DeadBush - mituishere now about this. I didn't wanted to bring politics here but that's the best way to explain.
Some Support Communist
Some Support Democratic
Doesn't mean they are racist or discriminative towards each other. No right? cuz they know everyone has different opinion and different issues to work on. I won't say they don't have compition but they have compition in some way. One party may think they need to win election. Other may think they need to develop the country first before anyone wins. They have compition on two different things here. I know half of my words don't make sense but adjust cuz I'm from Asia and My first language isn't English. @mituishere :- OMG you are racist cuz u don't saying you don't know English more than your First language. So think twice and think about others opinion, issues faced by others before posting your one sided shit opinion. 

Plus u said Falix only wants money.
Remember that Lamaker aka Pamar needs to pay for nodes which isn't cheap. So customers from Countries with lower ad income are increasing which is Making it hard for falix to pay for the stuffs. And they didn't even completely ban them they just said earn few coins or invite a friend easy. 

Ok If you want falix to unban countries they will for sure but you need to pay for the loss ok?
if no then stfu
Pamar - mituishere you said I've scammed you twice, lets see
1) you say I've scammed you for designer role (does it even mean scamming?)
2) you say that I scammed you again WITH FRICKING WHAT?
DeadBush - mituishere You gotta underestand everyone has dine something which isn't good and picking them about their past from which they have changed themselves how is that fair? From thw top post you have just been posting about past when the stuffs has changed a lot. And next thing I don't use falix for hosting my server neither I simp or he is my dad. If you think saying ily to him means I'm simping then dude come to me I'll donate some sense of humor to you. And remember A lot of stuffs has changed. And stop picking on anyone about the past they have moved on from

what about the 'Cancelation' stuff Lamaker so SADLY wanted to deny?
Jedrik - DeadBush You gotta underestand everyone has dine something which isn't good and picking them about their past from which they have changed themselves how is that fair?

Not everyone has committed fraud and denied it, then continued to do it recently then desperately tried to deny it.
DeadBush - @mituishere then I can say that you made homophobic jokes too. but I only said that once earlier adding this twice but I didn't say that you are bad, sexist or discriminative right? I respected ur past well u did it like a month ago but still. You sent disgusting videos on the gc about Lamaker's mom and stuff. His parents did nothing to you right? it's fight between you and Lamaker
Deleted User - Pamar 
Paying through that role meant Exposure, a small thing that you couldn't give to me. Also, don't you remember when you called my logo trash, and then one of your staff DMed me with the request of getting permission to use it on your host? Did you already forget that?
TripHost or what name did that host have. You've DMed me, that you have some friends that own a host and need help with a logo. The owner was your alt. After I've made it, and after you've received it, blocked me. And let's not forget that we were friends at that time. Now tell me, why should I or anyone trust you?
DeadBush - I don't have tons of free time i gtg I'll reply later
Deleted User - DeadBush Everything you've said in there, literally proves that you're a kid. 

Ok, so, let's say that he racist. Then why did he banned those countries? Because maybe they didn't have access to google ads? And, what's the issue? FalixNodes was running from arc's money for more than 4 months without any issues. He said on the WH group that they aren't paying money for the access, but they have to stay on the website longer than 1 hour to achieve 20 falixcoins. And, isn't that already generating money for Lamaker/lily/etc?
Deleted User - DeadBush Jokes are jokes, punishments are punishments. They're not the same thing my friend.
DeadBush - mituishere Arc has clearly said that afk isn't allowed anymore. Then first sure google for being racist then try targeting small companies and yeah If you want proof I can't send u the pic of my id which says I'm  18
you are just like 15 dude wtf u talking about 😂
And you still assumed you could have said seems that you are a kid but you said literally proves
which means you only cared about your opinion and didn't think about what other's will think about it. You sent us video on Gc in Discord saying stuffs About Lamaker's mom like mostly homophobic
DeadBush - AWSLord you better stfu and Stop the spam kid

DeadBush Sorry but I don't understand jokes that reach the level of a kindergarten kid. My level is way too higher for that type of joke

I have no life
 
  Overused argument already. Can't your peanut brain come with anything better than that?
  
  
  DeadBush I have no life but you're the one that makes kindergarten jokes.
    
    Also, it looks like you've got offended 🙂))

ShemBane - CertifiedDog it lags if you dont have 3/4+ cores and even with that its still pretty laggy but for a host of this size what do you expect
CertifiedDog - why do people even hate on falixnodes?
Robert - CertifiedDog Mostly due to the scummy business practises, poor performance, toxic staff and questionable owner. I recommend you read this thread for more information.
CertifiedDog - Robert i have read the other bit of the thread, as i can say this host is only a big laggy because the amount of people using it. its alright if you dont have any money and want a free minecraft server.
Deleted User - ShemBane 
That applies only to 1.13+
I've runned 1.8 servers with only one core without any problems on another host, with no lag.
Chirag - mituishere 1.8 servers work perfectly with 1 core (optimized papermc)
Deleted User - CertifiedDog The thread is mostly about the owner that abused the IONOS payment system, leaked a script, and scammed some people.
Robert - Chirag I tried a paper 1.8 server (without any plugins, just stock config) with 4GB RAM and 2 cores on multiple nodes at Falix, and my TPS was very low and I kept getting lagged back.
Deleted User - ShemBane 
Fact: 1.8 it's already an outdated version.

Deleted User - Pamar hellooooooooooooooooo :3
ShemBane - mituishere i understand some of the points you brought up here but do you even know how the plugin works?
Deleted User - ShemBane e
Pamar - mituishere
Hibernate is intentionally making your server lag (freeze) while it idles so other tasks such as plugins could not work in idle - in that way, it saves a lot of cpu usage.

In addition, you can disable it by typing /hibernate or you can also exclude plugins in hibernate with their newest update (you can allow certain plugins to run in idling without hibernate interrupting it)
Deleted User - Pamar What about datapacks tho
Deleted User - Pamar Wait, didn't you promote that FalixNodes will never use Hibernate? 🙂)
Pamar - mituishere nop, never advertised that

LordOlympia - I'm surprised there's a lot of simps for falixnodes here, I used to like falixnodes, but then, flooded by a lot of kids wanting free minecraft hosting. Its so hilarious. The nodes can't even stand up to 2 mins. Even using sftp!!.

So trash, even the staff can't take a simple trash talk. Clearly they never experienced the good Ol' COD lobbies.

This is why zoomers and this earth's future is in danger. Simple things become sensitive

Deleted User - Ash777 define "dedicated RAM," please. As far as I know, virtualisation is a feature for CPUs. It's literally like saying "dedicated SSD." Perhaps you meant reserved (in terms that if you get 8 gigs, you get 8 gigs and they are entirely for you)? Otherwise advertising "dedicated memory" is as hilarious as it gets.
Deleted User - Pamar No that's not content. Let's have our dictionaries synced up, please. I don't see how your navbars are "valuable inventory" or at all "content" for that matter. Anyways, I think if you just add links to all pages on your website that should count as valuable enough.

3 days ago, abusers have created server in our hosting with a lot of alts and in each node we had in server creation and then started to heavily mass spam security experts email addresses and other people ones too, we got report from hetzner regarding and we tried to do our best to prevent the abusers ability to send more emails, though it was too late + abusers have found other way of sending emails either, due to that hetzner have told us that they will cancel our services and account in 31st May and there is no way to appeal for it, due to that we will be ordering new nodes from other provider and heavily restrict/ratelimit users from sending any outgoing requests (excluding whitelisted ones) and other ways to limit abusers to do it again. Due to this situation, our services will be down for some time (I will get new node for server creation today and I will try my best to recover data in today/tomorrow and later on move them to new nodes).

Up to date information will be posted here.

@Ping
#1: Currently setting up I9 10900K US node for server creation.

My apologies that this kind of situation happened, I am currently trying my best to solve it though it takes time since it don't affect only FalixNodes.

End of the announcement.
NickE - LogicApples yes, i'm in the discord i've already read that, you don't need to send it here
Abooz - Anyone smell a casual 500GB of SWAP ram?
RapedHost - Abooz lol what
Deleted User - Ash777 Am I supposed to have heard of that?

Obviously, the hosting industries have come up with funny terminology such as "dedicated RAM" aka "guaranteed RAM" (which supposedly is something good, as you say, some companies even advertise it as a feature), but from a technical perspective, the only definition I could find was on some sketchy website (2nd page in search results) that says "Dedicated RAM is the maximum memory allowed for your virtual private server." So that's exactly what I said, as funny as "dedicated SSD." If you do not get dedicated RAM by some host (which would mean that you get no RAM at all), they probably already have a thread on this forum. Somewhere around here....

Deleted User - I don't think he's banned anymore : ) why don't you go check
LordOlympia - Falixnodes deserved it (The raid situation). He needs to learn something from it. (And its not me to tell what it is).
LogicApples - Sloth he did have solid evidence.
Deleted User - LogicApples OH YES 100K+ PEOPLE LOST THEIR DATA LMFAOOOOOOO


As I said, and I will always say, use falixnodes only if you want to yeet someone's data without being ur fault.
Deleted User - Ash777 Just give me the words and I'll make the sentence for u.
Deleted User - This is how one of Lamaker's partners talks LMFAO 🙂))


So you can see the high IQ level of his staff members, partners and etc.

I mean, damn, I'm not the one that searched "how to be a weeb" on google, and then made a video and leaked their search history on how to make a free server type of video. Also y'all, in here you can see how one of pamar's partners talks with people

Sloth - Lamaker, you retarded son of a bitch, you did it, user data of 70k people, leaked. Passwords in plaintext, scuffed client panel, don't code PHP applications if you have no sense of security at all, webapps are difficult to create, hence why you don't want a bunch of people who have no fucking idea what they're doing creating them. I do not understand how FalixNodes grew as large as it is, it's a terrible service, run by people who have no idea what they're doing, who also brag about their e-girl simp relationship online to their clientbase of kids which are too cheap to purchase proper hosting. I feel no sympathy for you at all, I feel sympathetic for all the people whose data got destroyed and leaked by you, rot in hell.

Ash777 - Jedrik well the abuser made a phishing website on a node and reported the wings ip as phishing
Justin - Ash777 still is quite ironic. Its fun how falix is listed dangerous. 1 day later, Database leak. Congratulations y'all fucked up
Justin - Sloth mate, u expect satan to let him in after this?
ShinyPlasm - holy shit how the hell is this still going? last i remember this started in like 2019
Sloth - Shiny Plasm 😳 ❤️
Deleted User - Fuck FalixNodes if i see my IP or anything leaked you all gonna be fucking reported and much more
ShinyPlasm - Sloth ?
mtt - GavinFontaine Falix needs to be held accountable for their bad security measures and letting the breach happen
ShinyPlasm - fun my shit is here but i dont really care, been doxxed so /shrug
LogicApples - ShinyPlasm dynamic ip, change of email, passwords reseted.....
ez win.
ShinyPlasm - LogicApples till it has your address but i don't really care
LogicApples - ShinyPlasm ye until my address is there, i'm totaly fine
my ip changes every 24 hours 😆
ElsieC - Sloth Thanks for revealing the truth 
(Sorry for Ping)
LogicApples - ElsieC well that is pog
ElsieC - LogicApples 🤣
DavidSaguna - Yup very nice...
Korbs - Jedrik For whatever reason, Lamaker chose to switch the name from "FalixNodes" to just "Falix" and use Falix.gg instead.
Then, since he can't make up his mind, switches everything back. 
Also, I'll unmute you, since the domain was official for a while.
L4db - you know what is pure shit? Storing Data in a Text File, its not just dumb, but also the pure shit right there, Informations Leaked, Emails Leaked, IP's Leaked, now what they can do? what if someone wants to ddos some falix clients here? this must be reported and take lawsuit for bad, terrible, and vulnerable security practices.
Two - ok, go sue them, bet (for legal reasons, no I won't actually bet)
Two - fun fact: Lamaker should make staff sign NDAs, so he could actually sue people who leak the database.
NickE - Sloth 200k*
VEX - Korbs Ok Korbs, you made an updated version of your review to falixnodes
BUT if you are from the management team, you cant resolve the problems? Or that rank is for design and nothing else. Like I'm not saying that you need to buy new nodes for falix, that is owners job but you mentioned that they need to make a better version of the website that keeps the same design across all websites, like wtf Korbs you can do that and there you said there
"Work on better communications with our customers" BUT YOU CAN DO IT TOO 

Sometimes I think that some ranks are made for design...
And I saw that you made an app for falixnodes but that is useless as fuck

No hate Korbs
Triassic - Lmfao are you stupid, that's Lamaker's job at the moment.
Deleted User - Korbs Yo korbs, you lost this 👑 !

Welcome to the gang!
Deleted User - VEX They are just to be in there. They don't even have access to the admin panel, I mean, wtf? Staff does and managers don't have access to it?
Deleted User - Korbs Friend Request me on discord ktnxbye
Justin - L4db it wasn't a Text file, it was a database, but the passwords we're not Hashed, everything was stored in PLAIN TEXT.
Justin - Two Everyone who got leaked has legal right to demand 2000$ from FalixNodes for leaing their data.
Justin - mituishere Welcome to the Squad @Korbs 😔
RumGuru - Justin lol
Will anyone sue falix?
Justin - mituishere Me too @Korbs i might have some information you might wanna see.
Sloth - RumGuru Most likely not, it wouldn't really be worth it, people could however demand damages from FalixNodes, if the leakage of their name, email address, or phone number leads to anything "traumatic". Not that they have the money to pay those damages out anyways, or that the data breach would result in someone being scammed via some Nigerian prince or something.
Justin - RumGuru Its not worth it. But they can report fraudulant actions. 🙏
Deleted User - I'm tired of this shit so I'll just make here a long ass list with what he did, and also with a small surprise in it. Let's call it a recapitulation.

So, We're starting with his first name. ItzAwesome. I know him from the time he had a free host with Nathan, in 2018 (I think). That free host was running on WHMCS and they were giving 2GB ram MC servers for free. Guess what... It failed in 2 days. And then he rebranded and changed his name, and here it comes. FalixNodes. In all of this. And it's started. ItzAwesome had no money, he had to find a way to get his nodes for FalixNodes, right? And he did! Everyone say welcome to IONOS! What's IONOS? The host's payment system which he abused! 



It didn't take them too long to die and start having a data loss every one week. But wait, he needed to install his nodes somehow! So he finds a way! After getting money from donations, he bought Tommy's script from McMarket. Yeah, y'all know, the one he leaked, the same script which he edited and nuked his nodes under the name of IetCrift. And guess what, he got banned on mc-market for a little bit of time. He wanted to revamp FalixNodes, to make it "Better than FreeMC". Mario appeared. You don't know who's Mario? Mario is the guy that made the Dashboard! It went great for the first 2 weeks until they wanted to revamp again, and yah, you guessed. It got closed... It was so sad...(Sarcasm) But wait! After a little bit, it came back! It came back with new forces! There was a new stunning design, but still no money for nodes...
It got closed after a few name changes and after another data loss.





He even used this last image as proof of him really paying for the IONOS nodes.

I mean, even one of his staff DMed me to come back...
After it got closed, he started wanting to get hired. He got hired, he gave their FalixNodes's SRC and then he nuked one of them after his identity was found again, as him being ItzAwesome. 





He had one more try after that with a host, the host was called PureRam. I did him a trashy logo for free because we were friends back then (I don't even know how). It got closed after a short time.
But now, he got hired on FabitHost, with a new name "Pamar". He did the same things... He installed FalixNodes SRC, they even gave WISP for free for a short time. They were having success. Aaaaand, he got demoted. And here everything starts again. The new FalixNodes (the actual one). I joined in, to see what illegal thing is he doing now. After a bit, he needed help from me again. He said this

And I did. He added me in one group with his alt. I did him the logo and guess what. He blocked me from all of his accounts but not banned me on Falix.
After a bit, I've sent 2 photos with the same guy, and guess what... I GOT WARNED FOR GAY CONTENT!

The guy was a bodybuilder, he even sells training plans... Such a homophobe. To escape that, he came out as bisexual, and he even included the pride into his logo... More time goes away, I keep helping people in FalixnNodes, started my own projects (Failed with all of them), and then I've got hired. I was almost the only one helping. Oliver, another staff member, abused, Pamar didn't give a fuck. I've had to make a whole propaganda so he could get fired. And he got, but not by Lamaker. By Cat, the only guy that gives a shit about this host. He even made a company for them, he made everything that Lamaker needed. And here we are. Lamaker is online dating and not giving a shit, the performance is trash, FalixNodes's database got leaked. People got spammed with porn emails and every email and IP of their users are now on the Internet. I'm tired of this shit. Even one of his staff members started complaining and making bad reviews. So here I am, working on my actual project, Unfolded Domains (A Minecraft server), and writing about this shit. The only hope we have right now is Cat. He is the only one that can save FalixNodes by firing Lamaker because he haves every permission on discord and he also owns the Company, and hire talented people, people which actually care.

After getting money from donations, he bought Tommy's script from McMarket. Yeah, y'all know, the one he leaked, the same script which he edited and nuked his nodes under the name of IetCrift. And guess what, he got banned on mc-market for a little bit of time. He wanted to revamp FalixNodes, to make it "Better than FreeMC". Mario appeared. You don't know who's Mario? Mario is the guy that made the Dashboard! It went great for the first 2 weeks until they wanted to revamp again, and yah, you guessed. It got closed... It was so sad...(Sarcasm) But wait! After a little bit, it came back! It came back with new forces! There was a new stunning design, but still no money for nodes...
It got closed after a few name changes and after another data loss.





He even used this last image as proof of him really paying for the IONOS nodes.

I mean, even one of his staff DMed me to come back...
After it got closed, he started wanting to get hired. He got hired, he gave their FalixNodes's SRC and then he nuked one of them after his identity was found again, as him being ItzAwesome. 





He had one more try after that with a host, the host was called PureRam. I did him a trashy logo for free because we were friends back then (I don't even know how). It got closed after a short time.
But now, he got hired on FabitHost, with a new name "Pamar". He did the same things... He installed FalixNodes SRC, they even gave WISP for free for a short time. They were having success. Aaaaand, he got demoted. And here everything starts again. The new FalixNodes (the actual one). I joined in, to see what illegal thing is he doing now. After a bit, he needed help from me again. He said this

And I did. He added me in one group with his alt. I did him the logo and guess what. He blocked me from all of his accounts but not banned me on Falix.
After a bit, I've sent 2 photos with the same guy, and guess what... I GOT WARNED FOR GAY CONTENT!

The guy was a bodybuilder, he even sells training plans... Such a homophobe. To escape that, he came out as bisexual, and he even included the pride into his logo... More time goes away, I keep helping people in FalixnNodes, started my own projects (Failed with all of them), and then I've got hired. I was almost the only one helping. Oliver, another staff member, abused, Pamar didn't give a fuck. I've had to make a whole propaganda so he could get fired. And he got, but not by Lamaker. By Cat, the only guy that gives a shit about this host. He even made a company for them, he made everything that Lamaker needed. And here we are. Lamaker is online dating and not giving a shit, the performance is trash, FalixNodes's database got leaked. People got spammed with porn emails and every email and IP of their users are now on the Internet. I'm tired of this shit. Even one of his staff members started complaining and making bad reviews. So here I am, working on my actual project, Unfolded Domains (A Minecraft server), and writing about this shit. The only hope we have right now is Cat. He is the only one that can save FalixNodes by firing Lamaker because he haves every permission on discord and he also owns the Company, and hire talented people, people which actually care.

Deleted User - I'm tired of this shit so I'll just make here a long ass list with what he did, and also with a small surprise in it. Let's call it a recapitulation.

So, We're starting with his first name. ItzAwesome. I know him from the time he had a free host with Nathan, in 2018 (I think). That free host was running on WHMCS and they were giving 2GB ram MC servers for free. Guess what... It failed in 2 days. And then he rebranded and changed his name, and here it comes. FalixNodes. In all of this. And it's started. ItzAwesome had no money, he had to find a way to get his nodes for FalixNodes, right? And he did! Everyone say welcome to IONOS! What's IONOS? The host's payment system which he abused! 



It didn't take them too long to die and start having a data loss every one week. But wait, he needed to install his nodes somehow! So he finds a way!

Hussjs - Hello there, I am writing about the unprofessional company by the name of "FalixNodes Limited"
the owner (ItzAwesome, Pamar, Lamaker, LeonS, Lily) for whatever reason does not trust his own
management team to control the nodes or have pterodactyl administration access. Why do management
need this access? Well, since the owner (ItzAwesome, Pamar, Lamaker, LeonS, Lily) is honestly so
lazy and has the sleeping schedule of a newborn baby sleeps a-lot. The nodes/daemon goes down
and causes a huge fuss in the server. What is the point of having a management team if there is
no such thing as "managing" the platform? Also, the owner (ItzAwesome, Pamar, Lamaker, LeonS, Lily)
started FalixNodes at the age of 12, according to the Discord Terms of Service, you are not to be
using Discord under the age of 13. FalixNodes V1 however was run by a 12 year old which is why
the owner of FalixNodes (ItzAwesome, Pamar, Lamaker, LeonS, Lily) has a huge scamming history.
Did you know FalixNodes closed twice without any notice? This is because there was so many problems
and drama that the 12 year old owner (ItzAwesome, Pamar, Lamaker, LeonS, Lily gosh he has so many names
at this point) couldn't take the heat.

Following onwards, recently in the month of April, there has been a huge raid in the FalixNodes Discord
server where an approximation of around the figure of 5 thousand or more members were banned. How did this
happen? Well, the owner of FalixNodes (ItzAwesome, Pamar, Lamaker, LeonS, Lily) gave out a role to an
ex-falixnodes executives alternative account and when that user left FalixNodes, (I'll just call Lamaker
by his legal name at this point which is Niks) Niks had forgotten about the * role he gave to that members
alternative and thought nothing of it. Now back to this day, the ex-falixnodes executive had his alternative
account token hacked or something alike and resulted in the raid of falixnodes. But guess what? I, HussGB
was blamed for this raid, why? Because I was on not so good terms with the owner and staff, to make myself
even more suspicious I had the * role myself too. But if you were to request my audit logs from the FalixNodes
Discord server, there is no proof of me giving out permissions to any of the members who contributed to the raid
of FalixNodes. I don't even know why people like Korbs or Chirag or other staff members blame me for the raid
when they could check audit-logs themselves.

Forwarding a few days after the raid, there was a database leak, where some hacker had managed to get into the
FalixNodes database and leak all the information onto nulled.co if you want to see for yourself you can
&lt;a href="https://t.co/0UNZ2a1gQA?amp=1"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt; to view the FalixNodes database leak. Guess who was blamed
for the database leak? ME (HussGB)! I had nothing to do with any of the raids or leaks of FalixNodes and for some
reason I am now a security concern in the server when there is honestly no proof at all of me doing any of the
raiding or database leaking. In-fact the person who is behind all of the leaking and raiding and stuff is soon
coming out with a huge statement that will hurt the reputation of FalixNodes.

Oh and yes, I know Niks is reading this. I have a question for you; why are you letting Korbs
(member of your management) get away with his one star reviews on trustpilot and calling the host unprofessional, 
but when I was doing exactly what Korbs did, I was banned from the server and put at a security concern level in
the FalixNodes Discord server. Let me copy exactly what Korbs said at the end of his review:

"Also Lamaker, the owner of FalixNodes, needs to step down from the company. Because of drama.gg, Lamaker is hurting 
the brand of this company. Also, Exotical legally owns FalixNodes last time I checked." - Korbs

I honestly still don't know why FalixNodes is in partnership with Korbs Studio as his article is technically public
shaming to Niks reputation and FalixNodes. But yeah, I agree with Korbs even though I despise him.

Staff on FalixNodes are having a blast; enjoying abusing their power on people ever since I have left the team. I was the
staff that sorted out a lot of staff drama by telling the staff to shut the f*** up and do their unpaid job.

Hmm, I'm looking forward for my third ban and block by Lamaker for doing exactly what Korbs just did. If he does
ban me from FalixNodes, it just shows how he's letting a management member who still had authority in the Discord,
despise FalixNodes get away trouble-free from what he's done compared to a late member of the server (me, HussGB).

Logisch_JoJo - Normally I don’t care about things like that, but this host affects more than 60 k users... It’s a big problem in my opinion that Falix can’t manage their Problems... It’s hard to manage a host, a few staff members are a bit toxic, but all in all, Falix has a very great Staff... Lamaker and the other owners should be thankful for having so great support... In my opinion, Falix should just relaunch... I read the posts above and heard that Falix had many problems before as well, but I think that Falix changes the plan resources  and add paid plans to their main server. It’s not my plan to blame anyone because I don’t think that it’s helpful at the moment...
EmeraldMike - I can't be the only one wanting to sue falix for the data breach right.
DHiro - u r the 
only one
Willypro7 - Hussjs Thanks for the info, never knew that falix was a scam, and illegal company
SnowMan - @Korbs Do you mind adding me on Discord really quick?
!SnowMan#5381
Deleted User - EmeraldMike There is also another reason for suing and we already contacted a person about it. I'll update y'all in a bit.
Korbs - Two SHUT, then I can't poke fun at FalixNodes if he did that 😅
Korbs - VEX I still have files somewhere from when I tried re-designing all the sites.
Also, I only manage certain things: social media, help center, optional desktop software, and I also look at tickets every now and then. 

But yeah, I can do it!
Deleted User - Ok, so... Here's an update.

I found this and I wanted to share it with y'all


I don't think that's quite legal when we're talking about sharing fake info on a .gov.uk website.
https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/12470245/officers

And yah, that's all.




After a bit of googling, I found out that the website from PrimeSRV is stollen. 
https://dribbble.com/shots/6003677-WYBO-Full-Page - Link from where he stole the website.

I've decided to ask Niks about it, but secretly. Here is what he answered.

He removed one of the messages while he was typing, which contained "I also contributed" or something similar to that, but I didn't have enough time to screenshot it. So we took it further. We contacted the owner of the website. He said that they stole the design. I will not re-share the screenshot because I'm not the guy that DMED him.

UPDATE - 3 mins later. : He deleted the website right now.

NickE - It seems that Lamaker does not care about his paid hosting clients, over a week downtime not even a message in discord mentioning if or when it will ever be fixed
Chirag - Hussjs Also, the owner (ItzAwesome, Pamar, Lamaker, LeonS, Lily)
started FalixNodes at the age of 12, according to the Discord Terms of Service, you are not to be
using Discord under the age of 13. FalixNodes V1 however was run by a 12 year old

About that, I agree it was wrong. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-04-13/1618348801-346372-screenshot-2021-04-14-02-47-48-40.jpg
Jen - Chirag tbh u realize he is literally 14 so its a bit late to report him now
Chirag - Jen see the ss bru-, also he's 15
Jen - Chirag Okay well still he's above the age in his country
now fuck off like damn mind yo own business don't get into his personal issues ya damn fucktard
Jen - Like u don't gotta worry about his age
u is not gonna fuck him in the ass any time soon
Jen - Horny bitch 

Chirag
Deleted User - I'm curious what will lamaker do next. I mean, he claimed that he helped making that stolen website, he abused payments systems... What's next? Claiming that they bought a IRL dedi but they will still be using Hetzner...?
NickE - mituishere he has already claimed that he bought all the parts for a physical server but not has sent any proof
Jen - NickE i mean u claimed ur host was fast yet ur Host load times are like 200ms for loading a new server
NickE - Jen 200ms for starting server is actually extremely fast
eraters - ^^
Jen - NickE ur stupid oml
Jen - even a fucking contabo can load a damn server under 150ms
Deleted User - mituishere  I don't think I see the whole picture there, you show this yet only show his perspective, show full screenshot
Reverso - That database leak could've been avoided entirely, and they could've not stored data in PLAIN TEXT. FalixNodes, well Lamaker is "trying to fix it" when it shouldn't have happened in the first place. Literally rule number fucking 1 about databases, SECURE THE DATA AND THE DB.
DHiro - u are all shit expect jen omfl
Deleted User - mituishere I'm curious what will lamaker do next

same lmao, he's really scummy, but interesting. is a fun topic for drama.
Deleted User - Justin It was a unsecure text file with confidential info.

Nobody gave a shit about securing it &amp; how people could file a lawsuit against them, (and now can, because there info was leaked, have 100% the legal right too, however most of falixs users are under 15, whom can't file a lawsuit), but they can report them (lamaker) to the police in London, for abusing a payment method, which is shown to be illegal, and he knows it, as shown in the screenshot.
Deleted User - Sloth their clientbase of kids which are too cheap to purchase proper hosting

It's kids, most of falixnodes users are under 15, which most are prob under 13. They don't have money for proper hosting, and falix grew, because it offered a lot for free legit 8 gb ram for FREE, which just crashed every day, so useless at the same time.
Deleted User - Chirag Also, the owner (ItzAwesome, Pamar, Lamaker, LeonS, Lily)
started FalixNodes at the age of 12

wait, so he paid for the hosting &amp; the building for the company?? even though he abused the system, he did that all at age 13??!!
Jedrik - Striker he paid for the hosting &amp; the building for the company

none of these happened
Deleted User - NovaismyRoommate  I don't own it. I just yeeted it in here like how Lamaker did with Cristian's website on PrimeSRV.
Justin - Striker Bryan Kea. Fake Iban stuff, Hetzner Sepa. Client-Area made by Mario. Thats the early days.
these *Later * days, he is paying his nodes with Adsense and such. But still not good enough.
Jedrik - Justin paying

only when he gets caught
Justin - Jedrik well. yes.
Deleted User - Jedrik 
Lamaker reading this: YESN'T
DeadBush - OK im making this thread cuz its too much one of the immature Staff called ASS i mean Ash has literally no sense. One guy in falix said Management and Staff is trash which is true and straight up facts. He did factual critisim there. He was muted for Staff Disrrespect. Why? That wasnt even staff disrespect he didnt target a specific staff he said a community is trash for eg if you say humans are trash everyone will be like yes they are and when someone calls them trash they get offended. which is a hypocrite behaviour. And the Ash says e was disrespecting staff when he targeted a community of people not a single person and plus yes Falix staff sucks. Ash says rule 15 which is common sense when he dosent have one to understand difference between hate and critisim. And now that ash is just Staff and he is making unexisting rules and muting/abusing when someone memtions drama.gg in the chat. Thats not even rule and he says its misleading. How is it misleading? just because of some posts? then I can say all boys/girls are same cuz one made mistake. Plus he is from India so I should have expected that. And now he will be like dont disrespect my country. Dude I have rights to critise anyone its not North Korea. I can critise and say bad about anyone its your job to reply or shut yourself. Cuz everyone knows indian teens are soo immature and illogical (this line is not for all its to 80%. Cuz some of them are actually cool). And you dont have freedom of speech and rights to critise in falix. Now I know why every old staff left falixnodes and im resigning too. Now finally I realised Mitu, Withdrawl aka derp, jeekie were true about it.
DeadBush - and @Pamar Either demote Ash or tell him to behave since this is too much from him he has been doing these illogical shit from long or take away my staff role ill resign if you not taking any action this time
Turnip - Yes, indian teens are quite immature, there a lot of people I've met who are at the age of 13/14, I remember this kid being in an mc server of 300 people, he was an administrator, basically abused etc and claimed he never did anything, etc, my point is that the statement Deabush made was pretty factual, most indian teens are quite stubborn and immature, just like the person I spoke of earlier and ofc, Ash777.
Turnip - Lmao, "Harming Server reputation &amp; Bad behavior with Management/Staff Team." 7 day mute, alright so what I've gathered is that you can't have your own opinions in Falix everyone!!!! This is the logic of Falix apparently, you can't criticize shit in there, "bad bavior with management/staff team" doesn't make any sense at all.. I was expressing on how fucking retarded their promotion system works, apparently, they promote those who are "ready and capable" yeah, even those with fucking braindead spellings/grammatical mistakes, oops yeah I forgot some wolfy guy was promoted to support team cause chimken approached this little retard and said "You're going to make a great addition".. fucking seriously? This idiot keeps typing in "XD XD"" has grammatical mistakes, spelling mistakes, and a lot of other shit, tbh I wouldn't even be surprised as they have a 13 year old staff member Ashutosh Kumar, he was promoted because he solved 1000 tickets cool, This kid has a lot of fucking grammar mistakes and spelling mistakes like wolfy, tends to forget the rules and makes his own rules which happened a lot before Falix got raided, anyways I'mma end this right here because I feel retarded even trying to comprehend Falix's logic like seriously, improve your management system ffs.
DeadBush - Turnip and I got demoted for keeping facts lmfao
Turnip - DeadBush dms
ely - Turnip You were muted mainly for the fact that you speak bad of a certain group or country, which  consider as xenophobia.
DeadBush - ely I never said all indians are bad neither I said I hate indians. I only said typical Indian behaviour which was Ash doing and I have seen those things in lot of Indian MC servers. I literally quoted in bracket not for all. and that guys is literally 13 why is he even staff?
AlphaDarky - DeadBush yes ash acts like a retard
AlphaDarky - he mutes people for no absolute reason (like i was he muted me for a hour or 2 for reply pinging him once he should put in his name DO NOT PING OR MUTE if he has that many issues)
Ash777 - AlphaDarky I never muted 2 hours for pinging there must be another reason and read rules it clearly say don't ping staff 

DeadBush first of stop acting pike you were demoted.  You resigned
Ash777 - You are still prejudicing
AlphaDarky - Ash777 ash alot of staff allow pinging so make ur nick do not ping
Ash777 - DeadBush go cry in a corner
eraters - Ash777 go fuck yourself or are you to pre-pubescent to know about that yet
DeadBush - Ash777 lmao you are literally 13 i can destroy you so well buddy so don't even with that. And plus All the ex-staff and even lot of current staff hates you for the shittiest ego and attitude i won't name them here but yes they have told me that they almost left falix cuz of you lmfao. So stoo with your shitty attitude. And stop making senseless rules by yourself. I can literally prove here you are biased and hypocrite as fuck but I can't share the ss here cuz the personal dosen't want me to
UltraGD - I need falixnodes script, you can send me all files? Thanks 🙂
Chirag - UltraGD wdym bruh
Ash777 - AlphaDarky instead they should change their name not me
Ash777 - DeadBush well the person doesn't want to cuz the screenshot doesn't exist and you are bluffing
DeadBush - Ash777 ok then ill ask the person
DeadBush - And yea I won't cuz I respect their privacy too


I can only say is he is one of the staff team - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-04-15/1618464513-499432-img-20210415-105709.jpg

DeadBush - Ok this is soo cool by falix
I had no idea about this and someone told me so i noticed.
I have a role in falix called self adv ban. Like for what? neither I adv any host nor I broke any rules. But I have that role. I asked for explanation for why i have that role and no one seemed to answer.


I asked chimken why do i have and and he tells me to ask korbs 


And when i asked korbs he didnt respond either


Like wtf I got that weird roe for literally no reason and Exotical cat was typing in general chat when I asked him he clearly ignored and avoided my question and ignored me. And no one seems to answer me about this and im annoyed asf.

And if someone says falix staff team is trash a guy called Ash mutes them for staff disrespect. Basically you dont have rights to critise in falix when it is a right to everyone and I dont see where the disrespect in that sentence - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-04-21/1619000897-98208-image.png

Jedrik - @Korbs 

DeadBush
_MrKnight_ - DeadBush It's a fact that falix have shit staffs . I just rosted them by asking rules and they don't even know rules .they make rules there own. Falix. Staff = true form of anarchy
DeadBush - And plus ash knows shit about anything and shows attitude as if he is the king. Makes unnecessary rules like now he made a rule himself who ever mentions drama.gg in falix gets muted like wtf bro he says its misleading. How is it misleading? hiding truth? he is a 13 years old kid 

and I got to know that someone told me this that Lamaker dosent want ash as staff but Chimken and Exotical cat suck for him and vouch for him so he is staff (dont know 100% but someone told me this)
_MrKnight_ - Wow . Ash just message me saying" well... Staffs are humans". There are 15+ staffs ( including management, support,etc) and it's been 3 days that deadbush is asking for reply. And in these 3 days I saw this "humans" typing like metro train . And they just avoided his msg . Now WTF i need to tell . These "humans"are ment to support not to kick ass out of people whom as support and mute them.
DeadBush - _MrKnight_ :pepekwek:

DeadBush - _MrKnight_ :pepekwek: and again @Sloth add discord emojis here
Chirag - _MrKnight_ hope that's not for me /shrug
_MrKnight_ - Chirag It's for the people like "ash". Chirag.. you are a big brain not a brain-dead moron
_MrKnight_ - And also . lamaker pls don't be mad at me or anything after seeing this. I dont have any issue with falix I hve only issue with some moron kid staffs whom act like "thera bap aya" ( translate it it's hindi)
DeadBush - Chirag you are a cool guy as much as I know you

_MrKnight_ - Turnip indeed they have kids whom must go to pre-school as staff in falix xD

Deleted User - This host is literally like meeting some dodgy geezer in the underpass who's established a company with £100 capital and giving them gift cards; no valid contracts (they don't seem to be in English to me at all; the terms are something about a "port"), any positive background (or even non-negative) or professionalism (we've even seen their employees leave 1-star reviews on Trustpilot). I am not using their services, but I am happy that at least they do not offer paid services as if you were to actually pay these folks, I mean, you must be the most insane person on earth. Obviously, they can't operate this way, especially with the extremely low security and privacy standards (if any) that appear to be set in place. It just feels like some kids watched an HTML tutorial on YouTube and got hyped up to create a platform and since it somehow works it should be all good, I mean they even hash the passwords, what more can you ask for? If you're looking for a free 24/7 Minecraft server one could suspect you are trying to do something at a bigger scale and if your hosting provider of choice for that is the dodgy geezer instead of one of the first 10 pages of search results on Google it just feels like you just want to risk it all and go with a provider as this one which by the way we have seen issue notices to back up all your data due to a next-day network-wide data wipe. I mean, come on, do you really see it work somehow? You'd have a x10 better server on Server.pro with 10 plugins, 1 hour uptime and a free subdomain lol, I mean at least you won't be worried your data is being publicly available to anyone at any time, the professional support is 12 yo kids, and your data is ready to be purged at any given time, but not a time of your choosing obviously. They are telling you not to worry because they are improving, but someone please remind me for how long they've been operating already
NickE - WilliamD 
he does offer paid hosting
Deleted User - NickE that's actually sad. They must be somehow luring people in and making them believe they'll both benefit from it, while the people operating the host probably have realised themselves that they are not a reliable solution, e.g. one that they would recommend to a friend to start a Minecraft network or some more serious project
NickE - WilliamD I don’t have the screenshots at the moment because they’re on my other phone. But there was downtime for over a week on multiple nodes on the paid hosting. But rather than him fixing the paid nodes, he instead chose to fix the free nodes leaving the paid customers to complain in discord without replies
Deleted User - NickE Doesn't sound like a huge surprise lmao
Sloth - Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm I wonder what happened to PrimeSRV's landing page, could it be because people found out about you stealing the site?

_MrKnight_ - Ok so.. again against falix staff. I got muted by auto mod for typing fast. ( I was having ping issue and my msg got delayed and made me muted) . Everyone in the chat including the support team asked to unmute me . Then ash showed up. And said no I will not I will make me demoted. They said just do it. He said tell him to make a ticket. All of them told him the bot is down. Ash said it's not my problem ( nice professional way of staff) . And he said tell him  (me) to wait until I'm unmuted. After I got unmuted I asked him why dint he unmuted me . He said he will get demoted for that and he don't want that... Wow what a selfish staff whom only care about himself only ... Lamaker stop hiring retarded like him. Pls don't hire any retarded anymore
_MrKnight_ - Again against falix staff. Today I saw someone mentioning other host name. I asked staff to warn them . They said no  . You can talk. About other hosts but can't advertise it. There was no rules till yesterday night. Yesterday and day before yesterday 2 people got muted for saying name of other host. Falix staffs are making own rules . Is falix ruled by lamakers rules or staffs own made rules? Jeez why these 11yo retarded working for a huge company...
DeadBush - _MrKnight_ lmao ikr their moderation shit   sucks
_MrKnight_ - Don't forget who is deadbush... He is an ex staff of falix.. whom got fired for exposing there dirty business. Round of applause to falix staff team for that..
_MrKnight_ - Again against falix staff. I asked in general chat that . Telling drama.gg is against rules? . All staffs except ash said no it's not against rules you can name it. But ash said it's kinda rule breaking as it's "miss leading". All hail to ash the custom owned rule maker!
Chirag - _MrKnight_ deadbush resigned, he never got demoted.
Ash777 - hmmm chirag is right
Ash777 - _MrKnight_ what dirty business ? and he was a support team member not a staff
Ash777 - _MrKnight_ i agree on this one ely just removed that rule without even telling us
Wild_TFS - _MrKnight_ that rule has existed from a long time but no one even knows about it
ShinyPlasm - _MrKnight_ I can't help but agree with this. I am apart of FalixNode's support, and when I told Ash about this post, his first words were "can you censor the bad words" Is he a kid?

Anyways, after that he said "Ignore them, haters gonna hate"


Since when is someone giving their opinion on falix and what happened there hate? - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-04-27/1619517787-170362-image.png

ShinyPlasm - Lol I was scrolling through general to get evidence of something, i then found this - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-04-27/1619518670-429623-image.png
ely - I think this is an excellent time to talk more about how the rules are working at the moment. And about how the current situation of the Staff is:

The punishments and some minimum rules have changed, and I warned everyone about it, as I asked for the entire staff's opinion before making the change. Now, when you repeat a rule-breaker in a short period of time, it will have a greater punishment. This prevents people from being banned and having big mod logs.

One of the only rules I asked for change (which I already warned that it wasn't to have punishments) was to talk about other hosts since many times this depends on hypocrisy; someone could speak well of Falix but going against another host and not be muted. Still, in a situation where he only quotes the host, he is muted.

Drama.gg has never been and doesn't need to be considered as a suspicious site, considering that here never had and not even provides links with users' data (if it has, it will no longer be allowed to talk about Drama. gg). Anything against this should be considered an opinion that cannot be against the rules, as this site does not apply.

Regarding the behavior of the entire staff, including support and management, I consider that nowadays there are only a few problems between us, considering that we no longer have personal problems between members and not even arguments, making it a peaceful environment (of course there is still a lot of work to be done, and I am working on it). I want to clean up what is expected of the Falix moderation.

Thanks for the consideration
Ash777 - ShinyPlasm you ever read rules ? they say no swearing and they gave opinion about me and its my opinion to take their opinion as hate
Wild_TFS - ShinyPlasm wanna know something?
He says Mf is "my friend" and uses that a lot
Alot of ppl get offended by seeing that
Ash777 - Wild_TFS for your kind information no one got offended by that
Turnip - _MrKnight_ yeah, and idgaf.
SealMan - Utterly absurd, I don't know where to begin.

Remind me again why kids are allowed to own businesses? I'm all for supporting innovation, but this kind of thing was bound to happen.

ItzAwesome (or whatever he goes by these days) is not apt to own or run a business, lest of all one that handles personally identifiable information.

For one, you have the, in my opinion, insane level of unprofessionalism and clear flaunting of responsibility (more on that later). He's unable to take criticism or even begin responding to it civilly. He's cultured the same attitude in his staff team, muting and banning for the slightest criticism, their feigned sense of superiority might make some irate but I take solace in the fact, that, at the end of the day, most of them are still 11-year-olds whose understanding of pretty much any topic shall be very limited and who can't be expected to know how to treat someone with the slightest degree of professionalism. 

On to the "hot topic", the data leak.
For those of us familiar with the matter, it wasn't a case of if this would happen it was a case of when this would happen, and how bad would it be.
I think the gravity of the situation impressed most of us, 200k unhashed passwords ItzAwesome is trying to give RockYou a run for their money. Thinking back he appears to be copying their MO.

Unhashed Passwords - Check
Takes time to notify users of the breach - Check
Privacy policy completely ignored when handling the breach - Check

Clearly, ItzAwesome understands nothing about handling people's sensitive data (as if it needed to be said) and when confronted with the possibility of a massive fine instantly registers a company in the US (#5841775 in the state of Delaware) and tries to dissolve the UK company.

I don't know how he can still attempt to defend himself, this isn't slander, this is a description of current events.

A note to ItzAwesome: Face the consequences of your actions, your cretinism caused this. You are inept to run a hosting company, you understand nothing of basic system security and don't have the discernment to hire those who do. People's data isn't a toy, and hopefully, the ICO will make you see this.
Korbs - Yay, a 523 error all over it's website 😃
_MrKnight_ - ShinyPlasm meh its me redknight. i dont hate falix. i hate only how the staffs behaves sometimes
_MrKnight_ - ShinyPlasm lol
_MrKnight_ - ely there is a thing called update ping. do it when u update rule as we cant check rules 24/7
_MrKnight_ - Wild_TFS yeah i even have a doubt that ash is below 11 yrs old lol
_MrKnight_ - Ash777 you cant say it as u are not there dad or that offended person. they have there rights to say that they are offended or not . ok kid ! did u got what we telling ? go to kindergarten and eat some lollipops. and allow the big guys to work. kthxbye!!!
Sloth - 13 more posts till' 1k woo
FatGrizzly - les GOoooooooooooooooooo
Turnip - SealMan absolutely  true statement right here
ely - _MrKnight_ Not really useful since we changed a rule by removing forms of punishments from it. And the punishments themselves are private for staff
Deleted User - get in the car b*tches we're going shopping 😌 💅
Deleted User - this place is dead, can't tell if thats a good thing or bad thing
_MrKnight_ - NovaismyRoommate Its not bad as ur bad life xD. Get a new life b*tch
samxd - _MrKnight_ stfu fag, it's a lot better life than you'll ever have
_MrKnight_ - samxd Meh I don't have a life xD. Nova was my friend. But not anymore. For what she did!
samxd - _MrKnight_ she did fuck all, it's people like you that have caused problems, some people cannot tolerate cyberbullying
_MrKnight_ - samxd Meh you don't know anything about me xD. Nova was my best friend. One day morning at 4am IST. She dmed saying she is quiting. I asked why . She replied saying" I can't say the reason as you will hate me". But now I really hate her for leaving us
_MrKnight_ - She could have atleast said the reason before making me panic and scared
samxd - _MrKnight_ it's clearly due to reasons that she doesn't wish to disclose, so you can't hate her for that. Discord can be a toxic asf community at times, especially in the skidded side of the hosting industry (this side). If you were her friend, you should've supported her and wanted the best for her
_MrKnight_ - And meh why we are talking about her in this thread. If anyone want to bully me just dm me in discord. My id is redknight#0001
Ash777 - hi guys 
_MrKnight_ thye didnt got offended cuz i told them what mf meant and they were fine
Ash777 - SealMan well lamaker was planing to make falix as a us company way before data breach
Hussjs - He's an executive at FalixNodes?? WOW, AND I GET DEMOTED FOR NO REASON AND FOR NOT HAVING ANYTHING TO DO WITH FALIXNODES RAID? - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-02/1619958165-578492-image.png
Hussjs - Hussjs I actually didn't want to upload this and I wanted to set things straight with Lamaker, but when I questioned him about who Redknight was, he just acted like a complete dick questioning the entire Idle staff team. When I ask people questions, I ask with a solid reason, not just to play games. I thought Lamaker had changed but nope, he hasn't.
L4db - i still remember the breach, and everytime i remember it, it make me just stay away of this company
SealMan - Ash777 I daresay it's more than coincidental that he moved Falixnodes to the US after the data breach, you know, with the US having more lenient data protection laws. 

It still doesn't invalidate the fact that he did it, with this timing, to avoid a massive fine from the ICO, it doesn't matter if he intended to do it before, he's still evading his responsibilities
Deleted User - _MrKnight_  your one of the reasons why I left, shut up
Deleted User - and how do I deleted my account on here @Sloth @Jedrik
Turnip - MrKnight was a braindead faggot anyways...
idiot got offended I said "most of indians teens are imbeciles and some of them are cool" I said SOME of them are COOL... not every teen. But sadly this oppressed cunt doesn't get what that means since he's a thirld worlder retard.
Turnip - _MrKnight_ sad retard
Ash777 - Hussjs lamaker just give roles to his friends and i dont like that
Ash777 - SealMan we paid ico the fine and we switched to us for tax related things i think
_MrKnight_ - Turnip Ye I got offended so?. Iknow what's the problem you currently have.
_MrKnight_ - Hussjs I think you know the reason why I have the role. Which I had dmed you
_MrKnight_ - @1014#13155 Ok?
_MrKnight_ - Turnip Like you?
_MrKnight_ - Iknow most of the people have turned against me because I have exicutive role in falix. The only thing I want to say is that's just a role I don't have any power on that role
FC5570 - Ash777 I wouldn't call them friends.
Turnip - _MrKnight_ nah, I personally don't pick up dog ends like you wasteman.
_MrKnight_ - Turnip i think you better say it by looking at a mirror kthxbye!

Withdrawal - ok and
awsamboi - falix nodes is da bezt hosting ever, dey never hev ben haket!!!!!!
Gman - Nova who
DeadBush - @Ash777 But I want a answer how is factual critisim staff disrespect? everyone knows falix staff team is trash. Poeple have rights to critise. If he said Falix staff are dicks then there was a reason to mute for swearing. But I don't see anything like staff disrespect in "falix staff is trash" rather than factual critisim. And still About resign Yes I resigned cuz of the illogical and shit behaviour of other members which I couldn't handle anymore. (mainly you).
 The logic falix staffs uses are sun and moon which never gonna meet. And I was support team but the only shit I didn't had access to was logs. And I can clearly say that Ass I mean Ash is a clear dickhead. Not only me saying it other staff members who resigned says it too and Ash is one of the reason for them resign as well.
DeadBush - I would like to add.
Plus if you ping any staffs (mainly management Excluding ExoticalCat) for report like dm adv etc. Instead of they getting punished you get warned or muted. Falix Staff aka Professional Poeple
Chirag - DeadBush some people don't like pings like korbs doesn't like pings at all or you might've pinged exo when he's busy
some staff might not warn you for pinging staff like you can ping me without getting warned (just don't spam ping)
DeadBush - Chirag Ik about korbs and Ik i can ping you. But dosen't mean other staff can warn or mute for reporting rule breaker and I clearly said excluding exo cuz he is innocent here. But I have been warned multiple times for reporting. I don't have a good memory (I had big accident once and it affected my brain) so my Memory power is low. I can't remember exactly the names but I have been warned 3-4 times for one ping
Nova - Gman Bro, you're dead if you don't know who I am
Nova - _MrKnight_ you fag, you need a new life every fucking day because you can't seem to live with your own
DeadBush - Nova Lmfao and plus I can't add you as friend .________.
Nova - DeadBush oh wat, HIIIIIIII 🙂
dchu096 - welp, this thread is still here?!

Wild_TFS - Korbs..... 
Like bruh he warns anyone who pings him
Even if it was accidental and they said sorry or smt
Even i being a support team member get warned for fucking pinging him...
Now a days I just ignore him or close discord when he comes so I don't warned (I got get punished for warns but it's very annoying when u get auto muted) and in discord mobile it dosent set the reply ping as off in the next message like pc discord does..
And my shirty af phone kinda lags and pings ppl even I was selected to turn it off. 
So ye, korbs of you are reading this, DONT FUCKING INSTANTLY WARN SOMEONE
GIVE THEM VERBAL WARNINGS...
Yie - Wild_TFS and in discord mobile it dosent set the reply ping as off in the next message like pc discord does..

Really mate? It's the same on every platform. The ping will not be automatically turned off, unless you have some mods going on.
Wild_TFS - Yie idk
I never used pc discord with replies that much (pc died) so when I used it, it never enabled back..

NOT_WB - Hi
Korbs - Wild_TFS This one is all on me, I take the rule 13 too far.
Ash777 - Korbs can you give more context on what you mean ?
Korbs - Ash777 In a broader sense, I'm certainly too strict with the rules. It's become second nature for me to warn members if I see any messages with a yellow background.
Ash777 - That message looked out of blue that's why I asked like tfs didn't said anything about you
Mitoxe - Never knew about that thread kinda sad what Lamaker did for money
Ash777 - Mitoxe what he did ? cuz lot of things has been proven wrong

SINCE WHEN
Ash777 - Jedrik i mean there are 2 falix the old one (where the things has proved right) and the new one where i think there are very less things like lamaker doesnt pay bill and stuff like that .
Jedrik - Ash777 and the new one where i think there are very less things like lamaker doesnt pay bill and stuff like that

They were true, he got caught and had to pay them now he has "proof" that he couldn't give months ago 🤣
Ash777 - Jedrik nah 
in staff chat we used to do a like income reports now i can speak of past when i was not in falix

FC5570 - someone put some sense into these staff members - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-26/1622036124-616041-image.png
Deleted User - FC5570 Nah, mostly they can just steal and yeet ur files whenever they want
Pamda - mituishere first of all they dont steal your files
second of all deleting the files : 
the files are not deleted the nodes are just on maintenance get some news about what is going on before screaming something you kid
leastile - bruh
Ash777 - FC5570 i will agree at the same time disagree
Ash777 - A free company can be a scam but some places here are misleading and most of the people just try to damage the reputation (i said most not all)
Spoony - Honestly, Falix is at no use its not a good host either with lag spikes, unprofessional staff members, no uptime no use of using it
TFSxADVITH - .
leastile - .
Ash777 - Spoony @ely come
Mocab - hmm, some people here are sus
Legendary - Spoony its just u who dont know how to use a host . Minecraft server requires lot if resources. And if u good amount of cores ur server may never lag. Rather than being dumb . Do something worth it
SirBlob - Legendary Agreed
Mocab - Legendary well said
DeadBush - Legendary That's just some bullshit you said I'll explain you the real shit here. I'm on Falix From so long when it had like 500 members. It used to be really good but now since there are like 80k+ users. The nodes are not enough and they are just overloaded no matter how much ram or core you have will still lag if the node gets overloaded. Maybe sometimes when most of the server goes offline it may not lag but 90% of the time it does. Leave java server aside which uses a lot of resources even one of the lowest resources eater PocketMine-MP lags too. It's because of Overload in nodes cuz of over allocation. They just need more nodes.
And this is the truth
DeadBush - Spoony I can partially agree to first point. 
And I totally agree with the point where you mentioned staffs 😂
DeadBush - Ash777 So in your pov you mean
If I open a free company I can freely run scams.
Mocab - DeadBush the problem is there are some abusers, and they wont give up. if they go away most of the problems will be solved
Ash777 - DeadBush when i said that ?
Ash777 - i said a free company can be a scam
Mocab - Spoony as for the staff you can report to chimken or lamaker
DeadBush - Mocab it's not about abusers. It's about over-allocation. do. even know what over allocation means
DeadBush - Ash777 and still it's illegal
SirBlob - DeadBush Yo friendly Fire, I do see your point about node overload tho . . .
Ash777 - Mocab i say only to chimken as lamaker has said he has no involment with staff of discord (doesnt mean he cant do anything but he will most likely ask you to contact chimken)
DeadBush - SirBlob Dude even PocketMine-MP lags in there which needs like 2GB Ram on like 20 players amd 20+ plugins
Mocab - DeadBush yes that is a problem, but the abusers do alot of damage
Ash777 - DeadBush when i said its not 
i think you misunderstood me , ely or whoever replied to review said free company cant be a scam and i said that a free company can be a scam
Ash777 - Mocab omg bs
Ash777 - unless you consider people runing minecraft java server without optimization abuser
SirBlob - DeadBush I agree
Mocab - Ash777 ddos , and alt accounts running on full cpu
Ash777 - Mocab first of all i belive falix has fine anti alt and how ddos affect performance it should effect ping more than performance and falix doesnt get ddos attack on daily basis also running on full cpu is not there mistake
Mocab - Ash777 take a look at the Singapore node
Mocab - Ash777 and the alt , i dont see an anti alt, its just staff detecting then banning them
Ash777 - Mocab sorry mocab but there is a anti alt in discord and client panel
Ash777 - Mocab its not just that node its about most of the node
Ash777 - and i dont think there is any ddos on any nodes rn
Ash777 - i will like to clear that i am not anti falix or falix hater i am just neutral
Ash777 - and i will like to congratulate @Pamar on implementation on new anti load (the error 137 is the anti overload) it has increased node uptime drastically but i will like to see some improvement in it
SirBlob - Mocab I have seen a lot of Anti Alt. I have also tried and failed ( THIS WAS MONTHS BACK WHEN I WAS NEW TO FALIXNODES ). Not banned from the discord but its stops you from joining and creating an account with falixnodes.
DeadBush - Ash777 oh u mean the shitty anti alt?
What will I get if I bypassed that easily?
if you know a bit of your browser settings you can easily bypass it
Ash777 - DeadBush well ik it can be bypassed but atleast it exist and i dont take alts as a reason of soo much overload
Ash777 - any way bai gtg
SirBlob - DeadBush Let’s be honest, how many people have a deep understanding about their browser.
Mocab - i tried testing it now, i made an account and logged into the client just fine with a 10 minute old discord account, i deleted the account though, it was just for testing
SirBlob - Damn .
Ash777 - why falix dont let us talk about lamaker in general chat ?
Ash777 - kimpie and i were talking on how lamaker doesnt care about staff and tickets and bears summon in chat and purged it and looks like he was counting my messages

BrendansAtWork - We told Lamaker exactly how they're going to get attacked and what'll happen after an audit and they basically told us to fuck off and then a month later they're in a breach lmao

BaconHead - HenryH I've read threads with 400 posts but I can't be DAMNED to go through this
HenryH - BaconHead ikr lmao
MTGSquad - Damn, 1147 posts? Well, i guess exposing a big group of scammers takes a ton of discussing 😆
Deleted User - MTGSquad mostly his staff members (dogs) are trying to protect his ass but they can't.
Ash777 - mituishere well if they cant why this tread isnt done yet
Chirag - now you know why all nodes were at 100% CPU last month: - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-11/1623443918-558785-image.png
Jen - Chirag he needs bitcoin to afford his servers bruh
That's why he can't invest in a offsite backup system
Ash777 - Chirag he can have dedi solely for mining
Chirag - Ash777 he can have one, but not 10 dedis for mining
Mocab - mituishere well I'm guessing you are worst than dogs, I am neutral here but I cannot keep quiet at people who mock and call others things they don't like, watch your mouth next time.
Mocab - Also I don't see any staff protecting him here
DeadBush - Mocab well You are new here so you know nothing. @mituishere was scammed by Lamaker. Lamaker recently scammed Kimpie's friend too. 
Lamaker has scammed a lot of people. And even abused the Node providers.
And I don't see anything wrong in mocking wrong doing. But trying to vouch for wrong doing is wrong.
You should really read the document prepared by jeekie where he wrote all the facts and truth.
And a lot if staffs tried vouch and many of them resigned so you then as non staff they used to vouch when they were staff
DeadBush - @Mocab and why do think almost all of the old staff resigned except ExoticalCat, Chimken and Korbs.
Even Jeekie left who helped Lamaker the most with the host
DeadBush - But don't they already over allocate?
Cuz My Pocketmine server lags as fuck even with 5 plugins lmao. Before Falix Simps start saying get more ram Just stfu
I have 4 years of Developed experience in Pocketmine.
And pocketmine Should run fine in 2GB Ram, 1 core of Intel Xeon or Intel I5 2nd gen with 20 plugins. But don't falix say they use i7, i9 and ryzen? But Where is the performance lmao. Aternos and Server pro provides 512MB ram and it even runs Vanilla Server without lag when Pocketmine Consumes 100x less resources than Vanilla - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-13/1623557006-69310-img-20210613-094421.jpg
Ash777 - lamaker is getting pretty rich , he used to say he takes wage for tax and well some bills but i just found out how  he spend his money

Ash777 - and last month i remember lamaker saying falix is running in loss
Yie - Ash777 he DO have enough money for stuff. If he afford buying shits, why don't he have money for falix?
Ash777 - Yie well i am just saying what he said
Yie - I see
Deleted User - Mocab And what will you do to me, tell me to your mother? LMFAOOOOO Falix Dog Simp
Just go and watch tom&amp;jerry or what kids do watch these times.
Deleted User - Ash777 I still remember when he didn't have money for the nodes and begged to cat LMFAO

Also in there, u can see the specimen whore, called Lamaker, simping over RedKnight.
Here is another message that RedKnight got from Lamaker, as he said. (NSFW) - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-13/1623562092-387464-image.png
leastile - DeadBush Before Falix Simps start saying get more ram Just stfu

geT mOrE rAm iDIoT
Mocab - DeadBush oh I didn't know what happened in point 1 and I apologize, but mocking is still bad, and I'm not vouching for anyone I just said dont mock people
Mocab - mituishere my mother has no part in this, as for your second point I don't watch Tom and Jerry, it seems you forget common sense when you are mad. I will back of and just watch.
Chirag - Mocab best idea is to leave falix, aka what I did.
Mocab - I don't simp for anyone, I'm just here to learn some stuff, also don't call anyone a dog.
Mocab - Chirag I need some experience before I get tossed around, I also like talking to other people.
Ash777 - lets not disrespect anyone here
DeadBush - @Mocab 
Mocking is deserved if you do wrong doing.
Since you don't know the past ig you are making yourself look like an idiot here. We all are talking on facts. Plus I can clearly see you cannot understand sarcasm and critisim.
And plus why do you think this place is named drama.gg?
Mocab - DeadBush he called staff dogs, not the person you guys are accusing, as for the sarcasm part yeah its hard for me to catch up to it online, irl i know immediately, 3 llol ye ig
Deleted User - Mocab Because they are. 🤷
ExoticalCat - Hmmmmm
Deleted User - Mocab https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcasm
Chirag - mituishere everyone except exo*
Deleted User - Chirag Ofc.
DeadBush - Mocab well calling dog was an eggaguration if you don't get it you shouldn't be here
Ash777 - DeadBush eggaguration ?
Mocab - mituishere you don't have to teach me English lol, I'm just bad at detecting it online
Deleted User - Mocab didn't asked

Fallen - Jesus Christ, You don't have to say the truth in a spam sentence god damn.
Dviih - @1265#18904 Falix simp here who cry in the shower
Mocab - mituishere idgaf wether you asked or not, it's my opinion so respect it
DeadBush - Mocab Well this makes your hypocrite
Last time you didn't respect our opinion and kept bragging about it and now when someone don't give a fuck About your opinion we should respect it?
this is why we don't want kids here omg Discord age limit Should be 16+
Deleted User - Why do we even post in this post anymore? I dont think Lamaker cares at all, and it certainly doesnt stop falixnodes and his hosts..
_MrKnight_ - Totally agreed, lamaker don't even care about this thread or this forum
Mitchell - Lamaker simps
Ash777 - Znilla well idk why post more but the reason you gave is really wrong , this place is about 'exposing host' so it doesnt really matter if owner of host care about it or not
BaconHead - mituishere what did I just read also where did you find that? Did redkdnight leak or what
Deleted User - Mocab no. cry about it
L4db - Once again, anytime there will be database leak where all of your falix accounts are leaked + using again unsecured database.
Nova - Wassup peeps
Nova - The cool kid is here 😃
_MrKnight_ - so my discord main account got disabled , and i made new account , i asked chimken if it is against falix rules , said its fine . but falix retard staff logiclessmotherfuckerapples said im alting and made a co staff to ban me , but i got unbanned , but he started to say i broke rule , omg redknight is alting , etc thats how a professional staff behaves ? LMAO is this how u talk to ur customers ? - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-18/1623984140-46699-screenshot-1088.png
_MrKnight_ - then he started to dm me saying , i deserve getting disabled meanwhile i already made a report in discord by showing valid evidences , and he started to spam in my dms (literally acting like a 11 yo moron ) - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-18/1623984269-101638-screenshot-1090.png
_MrKnight_ - then that mother fucker insulted me , i talked to chimken but he said its not a problem i can just block him and he didnt do anything bad , he literally insulted me because of falix issues  , staffs can insult a member but we cant insult a staff what the fuck rule is this , was the people of falix staff team in drugs while making this retard rules , its ridiculous - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-18/1623984333-555133-screenshot-1092.png

_MrKnight_ - just sharing this because now the retard will say i inspect element this  stuff
_MrKnight_ - falix have the worst and unstable rules , last week it said u cant swear ,but u can name any hosts . but now its the opposite , u can swear but u cant name any hosts , why the fuck the rules are always cringe there its like a 5 yo old made the rules in falixnodes - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-18/1623985411-620640-screenshot-1093.png
DeadBush - _MrKnight_ Mom I'm on the ss
_MrKnight_ - LMAO
DeadBush - Their rules are more confusing than Quantum Physics 🤣
_MrKnight_ - #true
Ash777 - _MrKnight_ well if your account got disabled by discord , you are not allowed to make a new account as its against tos
_MrKnight_ - Ash777 well i already told , i had shown valid proof to discord that im innocent ,so its there fault to disable my account , there reason was "hacking , ddosing,carding,etc" meanwhile i was writing notes for past 1 week and didnt even code properly for past 1 month because of irl classes and tuitions
Ash777 - but i agree with logic apple situation , he false warned and muted yesterday when i started telling people that he tried to track my location and when i made a ticket to report he replied like this - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-18/1623995419-389432-image.png
Ash777 - _MrKnight_ well wait for discord then
Ash777 - _MrKnight_ well wait for discord then btw you said lot of time that you will ddos
_MrKnight_ - also someone spammed yesterday in falix , and i said to him to mute that person and that retardapple said h wont because he just started his day and he dont want to cry. i said i will report he said go on no one care , its like falix staffs things they are the boss , they are just piece of shit who dk what is proper rules and actions
_MrKnight_ - Ash777 did i ever ddosed tho? words dosnt make anything show "valid" proof
Ash777 - _MrKnight_ thats discord dude , do you actually expect them to check everything ?
Ash777 - _MrKnight_ this is something i will agree on
_MrKnight_ - Ash777 thats not our topic atm , our topic is " how retard is falix staffs and how shit is there rules and the actions the staff takes to control others "
Ash777 - i have my ticket open and logic apple talk to me like that i am nothing , when i was a staff we used to talk with words like sorry and please but he is like 'wow ash
you really are trouble'
_MrKnight_ - logic started saying "omg , omg , omg , redknight is alting , ban him , ban him now." bruh he didnt even allowed me to explain the situtation , then he muted me saying "no drama". meanwhile he started the drama saying im breaking rules of falix when chimken literally said im not breaking any rules
_MrKnight_ - Ash777 add me in it let me show  them "valid" proof of that retard apples
Yie - Ash777 that shows how unprofessional he is 🤷
Yie - _MrKnight_ some of falix staff pretty much kids.
_MrKnight_ - Yie 80%
Ash777 - _MrKnight_ let me ask staffs to add you

Deleted User - _MrKnight_ he acts more like a 12yrs old which just discovered the internet.
HenryH - bruh what??? "pinging staff" they act like 11 year olds and they never stated cursing isnt allowed in they're rules. Im fucking muted because of this bullshit - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-19/1624122195-126713-image.png

Ash777 - HenryH i guess they say 'Excessive swearing or swearing for no reason is also not allowed.'
leastile - HenryH u can curse and ping staff tho

Nova - Triassic hiii

leastile - mituishere gae
Nova - this place has gotten old
BaconHead - yes now we literally have nothing to do here
BaconHead - other than looking at old stuff
leastile - and joining discord.gg/falixnudes
ShemBane - discord.gg/falixnudes is the best host to host your nudes
BaconHead - yes yes your data is encrypted with sha256 encryption then we encrypt the encrypted data 5 times
Wild_TFS - Yeah falixnudes is the best place to host ur nudes
Mocab - Tbh falixnudes is the best, their support was very professional and fast and they even gave me free nudes 420/69, highly recommend.
Deleted User - Mocab yah they even gave us free gb of child photography
Mocab - mituishere ok thats messed up- (what he said was a joke dont eat us for it)

Deleted User - _MrKnight_ Don't think that I am on ur side or smth, u r just annoying and IDC about u, but what huss said sounded a bit homophobic.
_MrKnight_ - mituishere well im neutral im just vibing , not interested in any sides , and he was talking about me so i can say that he was joking
Mocab - Bruh, more than 70% of the trust pilot reviews is just a bunch of people who don't read the TOS nor do they know how to setup a server correctly, some people think that they can host a server like Hypixel on a free host and expect good results.

LandonHalley - leastile Im not hating on Lamaker but my server never stays on for more then 4 hours without the anti overload shutting it down. Then staff claim it is using too much resources even though I never joined it and it was paper with no plugins and they were still claiming it is using too many resources.

Chirag - mituishere lamaker has actually improved some things. but but, most things aren't hashed, emails aren't hashed, they're encrypted. same applies for passwords. passwords are encrypted, staff who have spa can see your email in raw, password in raw, username and resources
Wild_TFS - LandonHalley also known as very overloaded node
Wild_TFS - But I say that the ultimate tier is actually kinda nice
Deleted User - Chirag I still want proof of them actually reporting the data breach to ICO
Justin - mituishere They didn't, they registerd Falix Inc so they were in the US, they didn't have to that way, aka law ignorance. If someone sues them for 20k, their dead.
Chirag - mituishere he only paid data protection fees which is 40 pounds
Deleted User - Chirag That's still not reporting the data breach to the ICO, as that guy said.

leastile - Nova amogus
NoboKik - i saw someone saying like "Didn't get 1000 members..." in ads then it got removed loool
cyberwolf - first off give it up bringing up the data breach thats pointless at this point it was handled. 2cd off the data breach was reported lamaker even had to pay a fee. so shut your mouths nubs. also you should know under the law you are not entitled to that so called proof or have the right to ask for it since it may contain sensitive info
cyberwolf - so drop the topic and stop bringing up old topics because you can't get over yourself
Deleted User - cyberwolf

also you should know under the law you are not entitled to that so called proof or have the right to ask for it since it may contain sensitive info

He can censor the photo

so shut your mouths nubs.
  
Ok minecraft avatar photo falixnodes simp, a small question for you, do you even have the age to own an account on discord?
Deleted User - cyberwolf This whole topic is about FalixNodes being illegal, so if you can't handle it then delete your account from this website.
Yie - cyberwolf 2cd off the data breach was reported

i can't find any proof for that tho
Chirag - cyberwolf 2cd off the data breach was reported lamaker even had to pay a fee.

As an ex staff, who was a staff member at the time of the breach, the data breach was NOT reported, only the data protection fee was paid, which is 40 pounds.
Ryan - at this point believing that lambmaker is a good guy is the same as believing the earth is flat
leastile - mituishere LMAO

Mocab - Robert I think lamaker meant to use it as a fact, he never said you must click on it, or click on ads for no reason, he just said if anyone does then he earns more
Mocab - i might be wrong, but from what it says he never said click on ads for no reason, he was stating facts

Somewhat - Nova Honestly I hate mituishere, but joking about being gay isn't cool. People get killed for being gay. Like Saudi Arabia. People get silenced, LOVE IS FUCKING LOVE!

&amp; You can't argue with facts!
Nova - Somewhat its a joke. Chill dude- I'm a minor don't gotta be so harsh 😔
Nova - Somewhat why you gotta be so rude~ don't you know I'm human to~~~~
Nova - guys I'm officially gay, so surprising ikr 🤯
Somewhat - Nova I'm not being rude. It does sound in a rude tone, yeah I get that. But also we are all minors.
Nova - Somewhat I'm the definition of annoying on drama.gg, do you know who i am?
Somewhat - Nova !ban @Nova #1. Violating Discord Guidelines, Violating Drama.gg Community Rules. Violating Drama.gg Discord server rule 3. Discrimination. Annoying. Violating the USA LAW of Speech. Absolute egotistical. Violating USA Law (Arrival 17) for Public Speech.
Nova - Somewhat t f, that made my brain break its summer give me a break
Nova - Somewhat thanks 😉
Somewhat - Who even raises someone so badly, that they joke about something people get killed off of? Why don't u go to Saudi Arabia, and you'll get cut off for just being a women.
Nova - Somewhat my parents didn't me, i raised myself, IM A PROUD YOUNG WOMEN
Somewhat - Somewhat There are literally kids dying in Africa. Yet I understand you want to joke, But legit, why don't you go to Africa and see it. And INDIA COVID SPIKE, DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE WE'VE LOST TO THAT? you know this is exactly the reason why people lose faith in humanity.
Somewhat - This is exactly why the world can't fucking have nice things, BECAUSE OF PEOPLE LIKE THESE.
Nova - Somewhat Ayo look i didn't mention the killing part, that's all you, I'm bisexial so I have nothing against lgbtq+ things but like its just a joke, you shouldn't take it so personally. I get it if someone's like 19 years old and saying that sh1t, but a lot of people on discord are going to joke around like this. I get you don't like it but most people won't stop making jokes  about it just because you "said so" or "spoke up about it" so take a chill pill pls
Somewhat - Nova This is bigger then just you making jokes about stuff people get beheaded over. It's more of JUST YOU. LEARN TO RESPECT OTHERS, AND BECOME A BETTER PERSON.
Nova - Somewhat YOU'RE MAKING ME LAUGH SO HARD RN LIKE HAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA WTF NO ONE HAS EVER SAID THIS TO ME FOR JUST SAYING A JOKE 🤣
Wild_TFS - I'm still in falix so I can reach level 100
Soon I'm going to reach it then I might just leave it lmao
DeadBush - Wild_TFS you gonna leave ur friends like me alone? 🥺
BaconHead - Somewhat He's joking around dude
samxd - Somewhat You know what buddy, we should just kill the lot of em. Burn them all.
leastile - Nova .
leastile - Somewhat FUCKING INDIA COVID SPIKE

we gave shiba coins to them 😃
Nova - leastile 🙂
leastile - lol
Somewhat - BaconHead Joking around of something people get killed about?
Triassic - What has this thread come to, it's literally full of small talk and nothing that is actually on-topic.
Nova - Somewhat you're making such a big deal about this like wtf
Somewhat - Nova Because you made a joke out of something so serious? Do you not get that?
BaconHead - guys I think he's new here
BaconHead - Triassic lmao yes we just use this thread for random stuff
Wild_TFS - DeadBush no ill just stop talking as much and i will become a discord mod at xfuryus's server
Somewhat - BaconHead Hmmm.
Triassic - BaconHead Me?
samxd - Somewhat Why has this site been flooded with little pathetic gender benders like you? Nobody gives a fuck what you think, this is for discussing bad hosting services, not if you're a gender bender or not. Cut the bullshit.
Somewhat - samxd You literally got banned from drama.gg discord server, and violated Discord Community Rules. You literally discriminated.
Somewhat - Nova You made a joke about something people get beheaded? And that is serious?
Triassic - I wish the Forum Moderators actually did something about people who just post shit on threads that has no relation to the actual topic, it's not even funny anymore :/
samxd - Somewhat Sorry Mr. Contradictor. You said that I deserved to be beheaded, and now you're criticising someone else for making a joke about people getting beheaded? Pathetic. Watch your mouth, bender.
samxd - Somewhat Do I give a fuck? No. Shut your trap, and move on. It's not that deep.
Nova - Triassic im sorry triassic I cant sit here and get attacked for this even though it makes sense
Somewhat - @samxd, you literally:

Also joked (more like discrimination) about gay people and LGBT (which people get beheaded for)
Discriminated against trans people, which gender dysphoria is proven by science.
Violating Discord Community Guidelines
Violating Discord Legal Agreement
Not understanding what you even did
Being a idiot
Nova - Somewhat how would I possibly have known that, do you not understand how a joke works. You're the only person who cares about this
Somewhat - samxd Okay, yeah I'm sorry for saying you should be beheaded. It was caught in the moment.
samxd - Somewhat That's nice, dear.  However, why can't I identify as a DDR2 memory module? That's discrimination. I feel highly discriminated against. If I wish to identify as a DDR2 memory module, I can. It's no different from you with a ballsack identifying as a woman now is it?
Somewhat - Nova Dude. Literally a lot of the LGBT community would care. Maybe READ THE news? Did you watch news that ISIS killed the gay people, and Saudi Arabia mass -exed-

You literally already lost this debate, I already englighten you, lame excuse.
samxd - Dear @Somewhat,

I believe you are highly mistaken. The purpose of this thread is not to discuss gender bender topics, it's to discuss FalixNodes, as clearly displayed by the title. Do you have a pair of eyes? If so, use them. Read the rules in the Discord server, this isn't for bent discussions on shitty lgbt. Nobody gives a fuck about lgbt, they should just be normal, how about that?

Kindly saying fuck off,
Sam.
Somewhat - samxd Gender dysphoria is proven by science, you can identity as whatever you want. And that's non-binary, so you can identity as that?
Nova - Somewhat I DONT WANT TO WATCH THE FUCKING NEWS, you're just making me want to be homophobic and not wanting to support the lgbtq+ community now, great job
samxd - Somewhat I identify as a DDR2 memory module. Do not discriminate against it, otherwise you will be reported to authorities.
Somewhat - samxd Well then, we wouldn't be in this mess if you just realized what you did was wrong &amp; apologized? I'm not gonna lose this debate, and I'm going to respond.
samxd - Somewhat What? Why should I apologise? It's YOU who is discriminating against me. Say it loud and clear, now. "Sam can identify as a DDR2 memory module if he wants to and there is nothing wrong with that". Go on, say it
Somewhat - Nova Well if you don't watch the news, I just enlightened you, and even before, though you did not decide to apologize, and continued arguing, and bringing up stuff already debated.
samxd - Somewhat You're full of biased bullshit, just like the news. That's all the news is. LEFT WING PROPAGANDA
Somewhat - samxd It's a honest thing if you actually want to. But now you BEING ENGLIGHTENED ABOUT LGBT PEOPLE BRING KILLED, you decide to make a joke. Who raised you?
Nova - Somewhat I'm not going to apologize, i didn't do anything wrong
samxd - Somewhat Reminds me of the time when I floored a gay kid for being a little dipshit to me, don't really care tbh
Somewhat - Nova Yeah sure, making a joke about people something people get beheaded for isn't anything bad.
Somewhat - samxd  If you can't fucking answer, and just bringing up other stuff, you've already lose this debate. With/without a apology.
samxd - Yeah, please ban this fucking bent piece of shit. Thinks it can rule the roost with it's lgbt propaganda. What does your thick skull not understand that this is a HOSTING DISCUSSION FORUM, not a place for gender benders to socialize. Get lost
Nova - Somewhat first off, my buddy sloth loves me, he would never ban me 😩 and jedrik is my best friend, I ask him questions ALL THE TIME. I did nothing wrong, i never mentioned anything about people getting beheaded. I'm ignoring you from now on
Somewhat - samxd WE WOULDN'T VE IN THIS PLACE, IF YOU JUST APOLOGIZED, BUT YOU ALREADY LOST THE DEBATE. 2nd time, I'm responding to that. And other times of me just repeating myself.
samxd - Somewhat I'll say it again, get lost
Somewhat - Nova LMFAOOO!!! Cheap move. You know you've lose the debate, and now saying "your ignoring me".

Sister, get a life.
Somewhat - samxd Not responding to any claims, already answered to.

Nova - Somewhat you're the one who actually got banned 🤣
Somewhat - Nova Wait wait. Let some LGBT communites join in.
samxd - Somewhat https://yip.su/2D5gq6.png explain this..
Nova - Somewhat so scary
Somewhat - samxd IP loggers? Yeah vpn 1 sec.
samxd - Somewhat Too late, gotcha
Nova - Somewhat LOL
Somewhat - samxd Someone forgot I used a VPN?
Toki0179 - samxd nah u probably got mine lmfao
Somewhat - samxd Also I changed my IP, in the case you did get it.
samxd - Somewhat That's fine, I'll be reporting your online activities of discrimination &amp; hate speech to your ISP.
Somewhat - Which ISP? I have like 4 routers
samxd - Somewhat Don't you worry about it, your contract will be terminated. Thank you for understanding - have a great day!
Somewhat - samxd LOL. Don't report someone that's not me. And which ISP is it, I have 3 fucking connections.
samxd - Somewhat Changed from 4 to 3. Don't want to hear it. I know which one is you, as I've studied your location based on screenshots &amp; other information in which you've sent in the past.
Somewhat - Somewhat anyways I used a vpn. And I'm sure other people clicked the link. So good luck reporting me to a vpn.
samxd - Somewhat That's absolutely fine, there are no VPN / proxy IPs logged. I know your location, and one of the IPs matches with that location. You will be reported.
Somewhat - samxd I've studied your location based on screenshots &amp; other information in which you've sent in the past.

Sure sure. I've used vpns close to me. It's called "quick connect".
Somewhat - Mate. Go ahead.
samxd - Somewhat Mhm, and I know your service provider doesn't offer a VPN service. The IP logged is registered with your service providers ASN. You will be reported - good day.
Somewhat - samxd good day.
Somewhat - Also, I know I've acted very "rude", but it was caught in the moment, but that is no excuse. But yeah. This place is for drama &amp; toxicity, it's very childish to send a IP Logger. Honest. Don't think you'll have much luck with reporting me.
samxd - Somewhat Thank you for your opinion. However, I am going to go ahead and submit an abuse report. - Sam
Triassic - @Somewhat Not just rude, you've been basically annoying, you're one of those butthurt people who find something offensive online and just can't move on. I'd appreciate if we all could just move on and carry on the thread with the topic that it was intended for, Thanks.
Somewhat - Triassic I would, and would like to. However I am not leaving this debate, until they apologize. Your being hypocrites.
Triassic - Somewhat or alternatively just move on.
Somewhat - samxd Go ahead. Anyone who can read, can actually see this.
Somewhat - Triassic No. Forget it. I'm not losing to some "toxic" people.
Triassic - Please fill this out, thank you 🙂 - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-19/1626725756-655440-image0-15.jpg
Nova - Triassic thank you triassic, perfect form for the perfect person @Somewhat
leastile - Triassic LOL
leastile - jeez 60 new posts
Somewhat - I'd like to say sorry for being a bit toxic, and stuff like that. It was mostly caught in the moment but that is no excuse at all. And I shouldn't have said stuff like that.

However I am not backing down, you can just accept defeat.

If you don't understand this, don't talk.
Somewhat - Nova LOL
Somewhat - Triassic This just proves your toxicity.
Triassic - Somewhat Yeah I am really toxic etc etc, is that what you wanted to hear?
Somewhat - You guys don't understand this, and think it's pointless. But it's not, people suffer from being lgbt &amp; die, have pain, get cained. If you don't care (which we know you don't), then don't say it's a small think we're arguing about. It would be find if you apologized but you didn't. I've already apologized for being a bit rude. Though this place is literally filled with toxicity.
Somewhat - Triassic I've already stated, I want a apology, and then this could be ended.
Triassic - Somewhat I never said I don't care, it's a serious matter and shouldn't be ignored, but also shouldn't be discussed on forums that are mean't for exposing hosting services, you could've done this all in DMs to prevent spam in this thread, now this thread is basically littered with useless information that has no association with FalixNodes.
Somewhat - I'm gonna and try to remove all bad stuff &amp; toxicity &amp; rudeness out of me. And I'm tryna improve. Not that this is a excuse, though I have depression, and do stuff I shouldn't because of it. (I'm just giving a reason, and stuff that's going on in my life, for some of the reasons I acted like this)
Somewhat - Triassic I've responded to the claim, that this had nothing to do with FalixNodes before.
Somewhat - Somewhat I am not repeating myself
Nova - I apologize for nothing
Triassic - It's fine, just, please continue this in DMs if you are planning to, because some people do want to use this thread to find actual information still and I apologize if I appeared a bit toxic (the form i sent was just a joke). Sorry.
Somewhat - Nova stop acting like you did nothing wrong, when I've already told you what you did wrong.

I know you don't mean your apology, apology not accepted.
Nova - Somewhat just add me on discord and we'll deal this through dms Nova.#0529
Somewhat - Nova Fine but if you block me. I'm going back here.
Triassic - Thank you! 🙂
samxd - @Sloth @Jedrik In future, please just ban all lgbt discussions on site &amp; in the Discord.
Toki0179 - samxd Make sure its not my ip lmfaooo that you are reporting
samxd - Toki0179 It's not, don't worry
Somewhat - @Nova Can't accept defeat, and blocked me. So childish.

Nova - Somewhat No, I just don't want to continue this conversation because I have something to do with my life
Somewhat - Nova No, you just don't have anything else fo say, you took like 10 minutes to respond for each thing, thinking about what to respond with. You just can't accept defeat, nor apologize.

Somewhat - mituishere Your not defending yourself. You also the one using gay as a insult.
Somewhat - Also mituishere is toxicccc.. Just read his messages in the drama.gg discord server.

Deleted User - Somewhat I made the thread because he was a staff member at primesrv and as a staff member you can't tell people that they've lost their virginity to their mom, even if he was angry, he could just shut up.
Also, he was annoyingly keeping flexing, and also he admitted nuking a server, so that's another reason why he haves his place in here.

TioStitch - Jpaul They also deleted my server '-' but it was because they deleted the node BASICAMETE you LOOKING FOR A FREE HOST? ENTER FALIXSCAMMMERSNODES :d 101% SCAMSECURES
Mocab - TioStitch 
we gave you multiple warnings in the announcement channel and in the console
did you pay for it? if not how did you get scammed without paying?
Deleted User - Mocab Y'all literally deleted his files. And also, There is only one announcement in the announcements channel.
Mocab - mituishere well we did warn him in the console, about the announcements channel everything was purged yesterday cause of an update
Deleted User - Mocab Another reason to not use falixnodes. Why announcing in the console instead of the panel or the client panel? It's literally a dataloss for him and it still not his fault that you weren't able to announce something properly. Also, an update is not a reason for purging the most important channel in the server.
Mocab - mituishere well you have a point but we still warned him multiple times. Idk about the purge
Deleted User - Mocab What don't u get that the warning in the console is dumb and useless? No one is going to read the 1st list in the console, no fucking one.
Mocab - mituishere well you do have a point but lamaker did warn everyone in the announcement channels + people should backup their files often
leastile - https://discord.com/invite/falixnudes
SoftyDuck - shocking news
Deleted User - Mocab get yourself some new arguments because you already used that line. As long as falixnodes can't do regular backups then they should not be open. Everything you've said is approving me, that falixnodes can only your files, and if you want to use it, you have to do backups because you will not know when the nodes will go poof
Mocab - mituishere as I said, we warned him plus you should always take regular backups even in a paid host, so his fault for not reading the announcements or taking any backups. the way you say it is like wanting us to send him a personal message right to his doorstep
Triassic - Mocab On a proper real host, you shouldn't have to fucking worry about it randomly shutting down and losing all your files, therefore, you shouldn't have to worry about backing up unless you're doing some major changes to your server, also, backups are supposed to be automatic on proper free hosts.
Triassic - Sorry I mean Paid Hosts* sorry.
Mocab - Triassic well ive been suggesting adding a way to connect your cloud storage provider with your server but ive never gotten an answer ¯_(ツ)_/¯, but you are right
Mocab - falix has a lot of improving to do
MTGSquad - xCrystalz_ That is an extreme breach of privacy, whoever did this to you, you should report to discord trust and safety, tell them that someone did that. Discord will ban them.
MTGSquad - I remember, once I got recruited by a scam host, Of course i didn't mean anything i just wanted to ruin their work of course. So i join their team. A Random Guy, I have no levels, Not a single message, and They let me join. Alright, so i basically go ahead, and asked: Where are you buying your servers from? They said: We don't buy them. Me: How do you become a host then?! They: We get them from FalixNodes, I blocked each and everyone and left the server, never to be see again. A Happy Ending 😁
leastile - Lol
your_normal_professional_idiot - now falix's discord server is just a 0lace for egirls and eboys to hang out (and also for idiots who ask support in general)
your_normal_professional_idiot - your_normal_professional_idiot amirite?
Triassic - your_normal_professional_idiot Completely agreed, I really don't like the community there and this is why.
your_normal_professional_idiot - Triassic before it was a nice community for people to talk (that's why I have 101 levels) but now just idiotic egirls and eboys and a nice big hub server for steam creds grabber discord nitro scam bots
Triassic - your_normal_professional_idiot Yeah it was atleast bareable, now it's trashed with edgy people, horny people, egirls and eboys, basically, it's your average dating server.
your_normal_professional_idiot - Triassic also a massive hub for scam bots
Triassic - your_normal_professional_idiot well the scam bots are everywhere so..
your_normal_professional_idiot - Triassic but falix has more members (with more alts) sooo more scam bots than ur average server
your_normal_professional_idiot - Also they never pruned the server to get rid of these scam bots
your_normal_professional_idiot - your_normal_professional_idiot and alts
Triassic - your_normal_professional_idiot A staff once told me that if they did a inactive member prune, they'd lose 70k+ users (this was a while ago now, probably 80-90k by now).
your_normal_professional_idiot - Triassic yeah that's why they are not pruning (they don't wanna lose their no 1 spot)
Triassic - your_normal_professional_idiot but they're not #1 either way, who tf counts a free host's success by their discord members
Deleted User - Triassic They are #1 LOL r u dumb? #1 best scamming host service award 2019/2020/2021. It's their streak and no one can steal it from them

Nova - mituishere i can 100% confirm that is true
ZacharyPH - Uh primesrv, Had a VPS with them since awhile - suddenly went down. Left their discord around a month ago. Heard from someone they got rid of all nodes and deleted the discord yesterday, without informing or refunding anyone.
Kowone - ZacharyPH exit scam go brrrr
Mocab - ZacharyPH biggest problem Lamaker has is the lack of communication, something is changed/updated and most people don't know about it, the announcement channel is useless. primeSRV just goes poof with no announcements or any warnings.
ItzJack - mituishere badsk can.
Nova - ZacharyPH  primeSRV finally shut down? i saw that coming, and i knew lamaker wasnt going to refund anyone, he's just to "lazy" to do that
leastile - ItzJack only for 20/21 🙂
IoNetty - leastile Wiktor has a bad experience with primesrv, go message him.

Triassic - when was the last actually meaningful post here?
BaconPowered - SCAMMER COMPANY DARYNODES IS WORST THAN FALIXNODES!!!!!!! 🚨
Mario - We all should wait 2k years before the next reply so Flarum would go like "2000 years later"
Deleted User - hmmm
Yesyes - I lost my 3 months of progress here due to their server data loss and blame us for not taking a backup every day, that lamaker is a living clown even the support team is lying that my browser is blocking the panel to connect, i don't know what to do with them honestly
Yesyes - Never warned us to take a backup that the node is going to get removed
Mocab - Yesyes There are plugins that do that for you, you can even configure it to backup every 5 minutes,  as for you claiming the support team "lying" I need more proof.
Mocab - Yesyes We would have warned you if we got a warning from Hetzner, but we didnt plus: - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-10-27/1635314389-333287-image.png
Yesyes - Mocab one of the staff said "your browser is blocking the website" even other users experience that, I cannot take a backup since 70 GB is a large file and I can't pay for google drive there's a reason why I'm using this host
Yesyes - Mocab And I cannot provide proofs since the screenshots are at my main account and I lost access to my 2FA Authentication
Yesyes - It's just unfortunate they never care about users if they lose something y'all straight up ignore it
Mocab - Yesyes 70 GB??!?!!? it would take you days to download that much. Plus that plugin also has a feature to backup to your local device.
Triassic - Mocab kinda shitty that they take no responsibility if they lose somebody's files.
Yesyes - Mocab yea as i said earlier i got 3 months of progress there with my friends so it makes sense why the file is that big, the plugin I'm using only got option for googledrive
Mocab - Yesyes Use Drivebackup2.
Mocab - Triassic Yeah I agree but the entire node was yeeted so I doubt anything could be done, plus you should not expect much from a free host.
Deleted User - 2021 and y'all still use falixnodes...
owoSctrz - Imagine using Flaix Nodes in 2021
Bear - Welp, Nice.

whosthisagain - figured with months of screenshots of poor practice, excused by 'we have lives' in the context of poor customer service, fraud, and plenty of other shady circumstances. Id revive this thread. I've had plenty of people tell me the company has taken a turn for the better when new ownership was arranged. But from my experience, and what i see in the discord. its not 'better', they just mute and ban anyone who speaks up about the shady practices. intentionally fill up ticket systems for breaks, and purge the channels of anything that can get them in trouble. 

lets go over just one situation I've run into recently. Falix has released a premium plan which gives users better resources and access on par with a paid host. of course, you need to pay. Problem? I paid for my plan, and it double charged my bank. bringing it to overdrawn balance due to it messing up the money I had set aside for cellular this month waiting for next paycheck. 

In the discord, obviously just went to create a ticket. Ticket system was down, waited an hour. Tried again, ticket system still down with no progress whatsoever. Tried again in a few hours, still down with no progress whatsoever. At that point, asked around in the discord when it was gonna be back up again. only response I got was this one. wow, because that isnt shady at all.


For images of their 'busy' ticket system.


The bot has been monitoring 50 tickets with no changes continuously for almost two days. Considering I highly doubt they have 50 serious issues that need the max wait of 3 days for resolution. Another logical suggestion is that they filled it with dummy tickets to not deal with it through a softlock. Would explain the shady reaction :/

Now then, lets go to the responses when I pointed out they nabbed my money and gave no means of a refund. First people to tell me how to go about with advice told me I needed to create a ticket. Once I reminded them the ticket systems been 'down' for a while, they told me to talk to lamaker. 


Once I went to talk to lamaker on a dm, every bit of it was ignored.


After an entire day with an overdrawn bank balance, dm still ignored. I pointed it out to them on the discord. Magically lamaker responds there only to tell me that they all have personal lives. wow, isnt the first rule of consumer marketing not to overlap personal life with a company or business? im pretty sure weve seen this issue plenty before already in this thread. Now to get onto the more illegal practices aside from fraud. Considering poor customer service isnt really illegal, just shoddy.

After a conversation in the discord for a bit about the personal life bs. I managed to get one of the staff telling me this 🙂


So lemme get this straight.. You are selling paid goods and services in an environment where you arent an established business, do not pay your staff whatsoever at all, and blame fraud and poor management on personal lives? Seeing how the owners alt has a user info saying they are a literal 16 year old, idk what the laws are where you are for businesses. But if youre scamming people, not paying staff, undermanaging customer support and still somehow offering paid services and goods. Putting aside how illegal that entire set up is in the first place. If your personal life is too overburdening for the platform. Maybe thats because owning a company when you arent even graduated is a terrible idea. If things dont turn around, check your inboxes. Might be getting a lawsuit soon 😛

oh, look at that. icing on the cake i was just muted :/



and for lamaker, or whoever mentions 'you can email the support address', i tried before ever asking about this stuff here. I got a noreply email back saying it was also down :/ - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-03/1638555556-500003-image.png

Falix_Lily - whosthisagain

Hey, sorry that you had issues with our services and as of our last talk, we have issued refund to your transaction, however I would like to clarify few things out of what you have commented there.

First of all, I have checked your transaction history with us and I can not find any duplicate transactions made under email address you have provided us earlier, proof here - https://imgur.com/1DDFVmH (censored data for obvious reasons) 

Regarding tickets situation, my apologizes that our Discord ticket system is indeed bit overwhelmed with support requests, it may have happened due to reasons such as major update announcement which was asked for many users to open support ticket. We do not falsely report amount of tickets and it is indeed real tickets, proof - https://imgur.com/a/8zLlzLu

Regarding the ignore at the direct message level, it is our staff member right either to ignore user or help them in the direct message since in correct way, you should contact us either through Discord public channel (if it is not sensitive case), Discord ticket system or email.

About the employees, we do have legal employees and volunteers, our Discord server support team (do not confuse it with company employees) are volunteers whos goal is to help people for generic issues, regarding legal employees, we currently have 3 legal employees at company which receive salary for their hourly work.

And finally, our mail server is up and running, I have made testing email and it works just fine, are you sure something have not went wrong in your side? Proof - https://imgur.com/a/D8IN6He

Thanks for your read.
whosthisagain - def aint no refund here. you guys asked for my email address despite it being a debit transaction on stripe when i could have provided the transaction id. i gave you my email and you ignored it, didnt send anything and wow look, seems the balance is still the same - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-03/1638560876-574893-image.png
ExoticalCat - Mail server status
https://hetrixtools.com/report/uptime/09bce5261b5f5a376a900606b710ace8/
whosthisagain - i mentioned in the screenshots above as well, this isnt the account the purchase was made on. i gave you the tag for the account the purchase was made on in dms as well. which was also ignored. as well as explained the account being autobanned due to it believing it was an alt account of this one
whosthisagain - ExoticalCat with that status it should prove my point even more if anything. the response time and uptime on it is 99% with crisp responses, magically enough no email
Falix_Lily - whosthisagain bank card payments takes time to receive refund, it is not instant
Falix_Lily - whosthisagain This does not change the fact that DM is not place for support, instead email or ticket system
Falix_Lily - whosthisagain Could you provide evidence that you got error from your mail provider? Also regarding duplicate transactions, thank you.
whosthisagain - Falix_Lily you dont have my bank card, never asked for information that correlates to the bank card in the first place. and never sent an email that supposedly went through

ps: my bank has a portion of the logs for upcoming transactions where refunds are shown as issued under pending until the balance actually comes through.

on my bank, theres nothing there.
whosthisagain - Falix_Lily if you backread you would see that i tried the ticket, i tried the email, and was told by lamaker to dm in the first place.
Falix_Lily - whosthisagain We use payment processor Stripe, they take care of payments and in their dashboard we can view your latest payments, invoices and subscriptions, we do not need to know your full bank card details just to find your payment, simple email address is enough.

Regarding the refunds, instant is only possible if it was only pre-authorized I believe, but since your bank card has been captured for the payment, it may take time for our payment processor and your bank to process the refund to your bank card. You can find more information on how refunds works in the search engine.
whosthisagain - Falix_Lily sure thing. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-03/1638561873-892744-image.png
whosthisagain - Falix_Lily you never asked for my stripe transaction id in the first place. you asked for an email despite stripe never using one during the transaction in the first place
Falix_Lily - whosthisagain You have not been charged twice, top transaction is in 'pending' and I am pretty sure it will be reverted within few business days, if it is not, you can try to contact your bank or Stripe regarding it and they will look into it. Stripe reports only 1 payment was made from your bank card and there is no option for me to do anything with it.
Falix_Lily - whosthisagain When you register in Falix, you provide your email address which later on are used for billing purposes
whosthisagain - Falix_Lily not when you register through discord.
Falix_Lily - I have looked into your payment more closely and it seems that one of reasons your bank might have temporary taken funds from your balance is that you did not had enough money in the balance originally (it is shown in the screenshot), if it is valid case, your funds will be refunded by your bank after few business days. Proof of refund - https://imgur.com/a/NnGPiAq
Falix_Lily - whosthisagain Discord account email address
whosthisagain - Falix_Lily it shows up as pending because it ate up the last few dollars i had in the account and put my balance into overdrawn. 'pending' here means its waiting for my overdrawn balance to clear. which it put on in the first place.
whosthisagain - alright, that was all i needed to get. proof of refund
Falix_Lily - whosthisagain I already have explained, I have no control over your bank transactions, all I know is that you tried to purchase our plan, it failed since your balance didn't had enough money and after 2nd attempt it had success, then I refunded the payment upon your request, if your bank does not return duplicate transaction within 5 business days, I would recommend you to contact them
