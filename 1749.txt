anonymous_amogus - If someone ran a host paying for 6 nodes and they decided to get an India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ node but all indian VPS providers were overpriced. So they decided to add an Oracle cloud node admitting they used Oracle for that node and stated it on their Discord server would Drama.gg get mad at them or what?
anonymous_amogus - Keep in mind their already paying for 6 in this example and showed invoices of all those, and their using the oracle free one as an extra node
Zark - It really doesn't matter unless you break the TOS or laws
__SECRET__ - anonymous_amogus bullshit

Dvij1233 - anonymous_amogus not all indian server providers are overpriced check e2enetworks they are cheap
Ibrahim - Dvij1233 what the heck is e2e networks? Never heard of it in my life
anonymous_amogus - Dvij1233 Not bad tbh
Ibrahim - Dvij1233 it's sorta good but it starts at 12GB only
Ibrahim - Dvij1233 find me another good vps host but in Pakistan or UAE rather then India coz of ping
Jen - Ibrahim https://www.websouls.com/pk-vps
Dvij1233 - Ibrahim serverwala
Ibrahim - Jen their a bit expensive ngl - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-02-27/1645962924-664134-0a4141a5-6f94-4f05-8dfc-6c0f928d90d1.jpg
Ibrahim - Dvij1233 worse then websouls
Jen - Ibrahim idk what you expect, pakistani VPS's are of course not going to be cheap
Digital ocean is cheap for a small tiny VPS in india for hosting like 1 website
Jen - Ibrahim Pakistani doesn't have infrastructure like other country's
That's why it's soo expensive
You need to think about how much it costs them to operate
Ibrahim - Jen I know about that my dad used to run a VPS company, network costs are high bandwidth costs are an issue and etc
Jen - Ibrahim It's not an issue at all in most countries, Unlike certain countries where a Gig connection may cost $1,000
places like america etc countries with large infrastructure can get a gig for $100-200
Ibrahim - Jen and a 100GB SSD for free which Asians will obviously abuse
Jen - Ibrahim No.
Ibrahim - Jen ye you've srsly never heard of the microcenter?
Ibrahim - Jen https://www.microcenter.com/site/content/specialoffer240gbssd.aspx ah no 250gb lol
Jen - Ibrahim Datacenters don't use micro center LMFAO
Ibrahim - Jen well duh but i mean someone could do that lmfao
Jen - Ibrahim No you're just not being realistic and you sound like a young child with no braincells.
Datacenters get parts that are discounted and wholesale. Which means it's going to cost them 5-10 dollars less or even more than the average consumer
And they don't buy these tiny ass 100GB SSDs for VPS's they would rather buy TB+ in HDD or SSDs
Ibrahim - Jen not talking about proper datacenters lol
Oliver1234dotdot - Jen $100-200

I got a gig connection for 27$ at my home
Jen - Oliver1234dotdot Nobody is talking about residential connections that those speeds are not even dedicated to you regardless lmfao. 
Datacenter connections cost way more than your thinking
I've seen the quotes from these giant datacenters on how much a 1Gig Fiber Optic cost
Jen - Ibrahim Even cheap ass datacenters like contabo germany still don't use micro center
You're literally not using your braincells
FlyingMane - Zark 

Shershah You mean hee is becoming more and more based day by day
Ibrahim - Jen I'm talking like indian kid datacenter, can u not take a joke lol
