kamey - I've recently got my account banned from localmonero.co and my telegram blocked from accessing their group just because my telegram account had a flag and the name of a North Korean person, after someone who isn't even staff asked me in their group if I'm from north Korea I answered yes to that as I tough it would be fun seeing the reaction of that person. I joined that group originally because I had some questions and issues with localmonero.co that I wanted to solve.

This is just ridiculous that they just went and banned me without any further notice, and also deleted my data, It's just ridiculous that they believe that I'm from North Korea. I mean you all know the situation there. I've got the issue solved and myself unbanned but my data and money are gone, all the balance that I had in my wallet all the reputation and trades that I've built up are now gone. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-08-30/1661886583-78337-screenshot-20220829-203618.png

Sydney - They do have to take those things seriously, as dealing with North Korean is illegal in some countries (Not sure if it illegal in their country though)
