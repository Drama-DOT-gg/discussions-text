donttellmeanything - One question: Can an owner of a Discord server ban/demote a staff JUST for doing their job?

NOTE: I AM JUST ASKING BECAUSE IT SEEMS WEIRD TO ME. I DON'T WANT THE DELAYED TURN TO COME NOW TO INSULT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I'M JUST ASKING BECAUSE IT DOESN'T SQUARE ME. SO ANSWER ME IN A GOOD WAY

I am a staff of a Discord server. And they gave me a warn for doing my job. Look at these.


Rules for staffs:
DO NOT CREATE CHANNELS WITHOUT PERMISSION
This seems logical to me, because the server has a structure and if channels started to be created it would be chaos.

DO NOT CREATE THREADS. ADD REACTIONS, OR SEND MESSAGES IN #WELCOME

I can understand this about the messages, but the threads or reactions do NOT make sense.

DO NOT WRITE TO (x channels)
UNLESS THE FOUNDER GIVES YOU PERMISSION

Same as before, I get it.

DO NOT ADD ROLES.

This is indeed incredible. I mean, you can't create roles, when your role system is a dogshit?



Well, each owner decides the rules, but I see that server with a lot of potential, but the lack of competition from the owner is ruining it.

Well, read this for yourselves.



how old are you have
you have*
12 years old
damn, what a fucking kid



I'm not saying anything else, he's a 12 yo bullshit kid trying to make a server, but if he doesn't let the staff do their job, I don't think he's going to do well.

CobraE-Sports - you have to be at least 13 years old to use discord. Open a report ticket here dis.gd/support and report his messages
Aplimmm - The owner of the server can technichly do whatever they want , if the server is ruined its the owner's fault. You dont even say why you are demoted, it chould be for a good reason. And you probally did not get paid, so why are you so mad? This thread is bullshit
Timanttikuutio - donttellmeanything One question: Can an owner of a Discord server ban/demote a staff JUST for doing their job?

yes, yes they can. it's not a real job and you have no rights on discord, its simply a role the owner removed from you, its absolutely worthless
Timanttikuutio - this thread is also basically useless, you shold do what cobraE said though, if you have proof they're underaged for discord, report them.

At the end of the day, the owner (or the larping title of "CEO" on discord) decides everything. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-03-01/1677710190-815668-image.png
Aplimmm - Timanttikuutio This is just true. Tons of kids are mad because they got demoted on discord. Like its not even a big deal, they arent even getting paid.
Snyder - So true
LewisG - Aplimmm ^^^^^
