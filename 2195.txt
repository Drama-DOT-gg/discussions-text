MemzAMD - A random guy contacted me out of the blue, asking me to join his discord server FusionNodes, even though I already had a job with a hosting service in my bio. He kept asking for donations and promised a "free" VPS, which is a shitty VPS at 2.28$ (the min donation amount). I decided to join his server to check it out, and his verification system wasn't working. He didn't have any pricing, privacy policy, or ToS

I acted like I didn't know much and asked about the server CPU he was using. He said he hadn't decided on a CPU and didn't have a budget. He bragged about being rich and then gave away the scam by saying "Oracle has free servers right?" and said he was using donations to start a hosting service from scratch. He also asked me where to get free VPSes.

then his "IRL friend" dm'd and told me that the scammer dude was only 13 years old and trying to scam kids.

if anyone here knows how to take down fraud servers like these without Discord support taking 2 years I'd appreciate the help.

PadowYT2 - the dc has literally 3 members, this is literally like advertising
SolidSilk - "Im super rich, btw I heard oracle gives free vps" this is by far the most funniest thing i've heard all year.
