eraters - I'm just putting in 2 random ones, but ping me in the winterhoax discord with more options!
Endermined - Aren't. They. Uh. The same???
eraters - Pepenodes is a joke host made by Korudo: https://pepenodes.tk
Matteo - where holohosting
eraters - I'll add that for you
Sloth - where falixnodes, fabithost, and everything else on the frontpage when posts sorted by top
eraters - Added
Jedrik - So you wanna like add Relabs, Nexal, Navo, Nevo, FastDVS y'know the ones with threads on the forum you're using like I cba to check if they're bad or smth you do that :)
Triassic - Many are missing from the list.
Jedrik - Yeah where's cbtnodes smh
AYS - Idleyhost please add
Jedrik - cortex when
eraters - AYS I added Idleyhost, but I can't add any more, due to a limit.
Triassic - But IdleyHost has done nothing, it's not even released and nothing suspicious or sketchy has been done, we are still in the process of buying nodes (should be today or tommorow), we don't provide any service yet as we aren't released, so it cannot fall under bad services, it's just AYS hating me again.
Deleted User - Add FalixNodes into this lol
