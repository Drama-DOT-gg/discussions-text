Jamie_ - Finally someone has called this guy out. My company bought quite a few addons from him back when we were using 0.7. We found out they were leaked, tried asking for our money back and only gave it back when we threatened legal action.
Oliver1234dotdot - PGBhai He havent been active for years on his site, atleast not what I know of
PGBhai - Oliver1234dotdot he adds some leaked resources in like every 10-15 days
WolfLover - Yes its just reselling plugins which is not allowed
INfoUpgraders - https://pterodactylmarket.com ftw ðŸ’ª
Aniket - Damn, a friend of mine did told me about this scam, he even has some addons which are available on GitHub for free.
tenzfan - The only time I've seen him rewrite any code after getting it from ptero market or github is if it no longer works. Willypro made an egg that allowed for a VPS in pterodactyl. Willypro had a IP whitelist in the egg so that people couldn't pirate his egg (it later turned out he got this code from github) 

LocalHost ended up removing the IP whitelist and selling it, but thats around the only time he's done anything
LemonDrp2 - I have a whole document about him all his scams and everything about him. I have being investigated for long time.
luffyy - pterodactyl-addons.com is now legit
LemonDrp2 - luffyy yea I know it goes to the real SITE.
