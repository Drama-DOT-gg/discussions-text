Sappy - So I own a Minecraft Server called SapMC and TechHaves#6891 agreed to host it. After a lot of drama, TechHaves decided to quit hosting the server. Which is fine, but what isn't fine is after he refuses to give my files that I own. 



And iusehuzunibrother#0051 admitted to bullying me.



I already made a Discord report against them. I'm only making this to tell all of you not to trust any of them, like I did. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-11-16/1637024268-852321-image.png

FlyingMane - And? They have every right to.since THEY are hosting you and it's THEIR files on THEIR machine. 
Why tf would you ask someone to host you? Just buy a host space and keep your server where ever. 
You fucked up, nothing we can do
Sydney - FlyingMane Hosts DO NOT own the files of their clients. That is stupid, and the more you talk, the more painful it becomes to listen to you.
FlyingMane - Sydney except it's not a host but a guy who just decided to host it? If it were a hosting company you would be right. 
But they are not a host company as far as i know
Sydney - FlyingMane Still. The ownership of the files rests with the original uploader, no matter where the hell they are uploaded
pwned - MrTechy how old are you
