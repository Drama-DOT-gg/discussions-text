Perny - Plexed (Cyperia's owner) seem to be very rich as he is able to afford apparently 40 nodes for 9 diffrent hosts. That is already very unbelivable. Also by the numbers in OxyNodes (A hosting service owned by Cyperia) they host over 4 TB of RAM and 440 CPU cores.

But how?
Obviusly illegal activities. In this case, abuising VPS providers like Hetzner. 


(Images are from me and my friend whos name will not be told as he wanted so.)

Any proof?
Lets take a look at OxyNodes once again.

Here is a few normal active nodes:


Google cloud is pretty overpriced for a free hosting service. So I think we all know what plan cyperia is running there.

Here is a picture of a few no longer existing nodes:


Wow ok, I see.

Also my friend said this:

Oliver1234dotdot - I'm not the owner of Cyperia?
Dubs - Perny Oliver just works for cyperia, Plexed is the only owner.
Perny - Oliver1234dotdot Sorry for the missunderstanding.
Oliver1234dotdot - Since I've been in cyperia I haven't heard anything about abusing or something like that, so I don't really know you're on about, I could of course be mistaken but you know thats up to you to judge
Plexed - Cyperia does not abuse services.
This would be illegal and cause us to be sued and lose all our nodes.
And who is the person saying that? They do not match anyone on the cyp team
Dubs - Perny 
He has said he has rich parents and a massive sepa fund.



His accounts get suspended because he orders in bulk..


Thats all I have to prove Cyperia dont abuse anything. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-11-16/1637098388-138898-image.png

Perny - Oliver1234dotdot I have been gived evidence and found my own. And im pretty convinced that they are abuising. I mean the fact that only hetzner nodes are offline and nothing else isn pretty wierd too. And the fact that my friend whos host is owned by them, got hes hetzner accounts that Cypeira gave him suspended
Perny - Plexed Can you show any evidence against the fact that you are not abuising.
Tomas - „massive sepa fund“

if this guy is "rich" then hitler is still alive
MD211211 - Perny yea lol
Oliver1234dotdot - Perny I believe it's coz we ordered I think it was 9 dedicated servers, but I'm not entirely sure. I don't know about anything. but idk
Perny - Also why did I get banned? - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-11-16/1637099028-190831-b3318c97-0713-4e04-8d0d-d410ff119f5c.jpg
Plexed - Perny seriously...
Plexed - Perny This is internal information which Cyperia has no reason to provide, also this is a corrupt system 
First prove we abuse
Perny - Plexed read my first message for that part.
Perny - Dubs 
i happend to find this  from https://drama.gg/d/1024-plexnodecf/3 - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-11-16/1637100501-962755-56113928-a49c-4790-b5ae-80093873a3c8.png
MD211211 - He banned me to for sending screenshots of proof and I wrote a paragraph he deleted it and banned me. It seems like he’s hiding smth…
QloxXy - Perny listen were not fucking abusing, we are literally sleeping when were suppose to pay the invoice i cannot stay awake to fucking 02:00 am on a school night jsut to pay the fucking invoice and when i wake up, oh well boom hetzner thinks im late and suspends my fcking acc.
Tomas - But the invoice generates and is payable for a good amount of time, they wouldn't just suspend you over leaving it 3 hours late when it was just generated?
QloxXy - Tomas well they literally did, its fucking annoying as hell bro.
QloxXy - just cuz im like 1 hour late they suspend me they give me liek no time at all
Kowone - QloxXy they shouldn't
Tomas - that just isn't a thing? they even give time after the invoice is due
QloxXy - Tomas @Kowone ik they shouldnt at all, but they do it to me i dont know why its very annoying if i ever wanna pay the invoice again i have to stay up VERY VERY late on a school night and barely get sleep, just to pay the fuckign stupid invoice, cuz hetzner gives me no time at all
Kowone - QloxXy they should give some time, i remember paying the invoice few days late
QloxXy - Kowone well idk how, basically when i go to sleep then i wake up to my acc being fucking disabled so i cant login and pay hte goddamn invoice.
PolyAnthi - QloxXy Nope. I have Hetzner and I can pay my invoice up to (iirc) 3 days late.
QloxXy - PolyAnthi WHAT! WHY CANT I DO THAT THEN I DONT KNOW WHAT KIDN OF PROOF I CAN GIVE TO SHOW ALL OF U I CANT PAY IN TIME CUZ IM JUST 1 HOUR LATE OS THEY SUSPEND ME, wait sht i had capslock on...
PolyAnthi - QloxXy You can do that.. but you don't because you abuse Hetzner.
PolyAnthi - For proof, you could show us your invoices 🙂
QloxXy - PolyAnthi bro i would LOVE to pay my fucking invoices if the ygave me actuall time but no they suspend me for just being like 1 hour late it also happens for plexed!
Sappy - QloxXy can you show us your invoices as proof? Maybe they suspend your account because you abuse Heztner
SamCoThePug - PolyAnthi 

they let me pay mine 2 weeks late lol
Perny - QloxXy that would mean that you bought it at 2 AM.
Perny - QloxXy Also my friends dedis were not up for even close than a mounth. So this is just plain lies.
Ples - Perny u mean lellis lol, rn his spreaidng false info
PolyAnthi - SamCoThePug Probably customer duration trust idk
PolyAnthi - Ples You mean, you abuse Hetzner and just don't want to admit it?
Perny - PolyAnthi This ^
Perny - Oliver1234dotdot If that would be true, you wouldn't have bought 32 dedis at once 2 days ago.
Oliver1234dotdot - Perny Excuse me? YOU? What, I'm no fucking part of that 32 dedis? And if you're referring to the screenshots I sent in the group chat, they was inspect elemented, and I can even show you proof that I pay my invoices

Ples - PolyAnthi of course thsi fat cunt has to say it
PolyAnthi - Ples 👍️
Dubs - Oliver1234dotdot Whats so bad about it?
Leafy-ui - Huh. Cypria.. more like scamria
Terrible uptime, losing nodes every week. Add it again. Lose it again
F YOU CYPERIA
europa - Guide not being scammed:

Once you've found a place you like, verify the following:
   That it's existed for more than a couple of months
   That it has up-to-date contact information and any applicable legal information
   That it follows the basic legal framework of today, i.e. has terms that define the contract you and the "company" enter into, and doesn't have terms with ridiculous strings attached as well as has proper policies on data protection and buyers protection (often called a Service Level Agreement, or something alike).
   That, if it claims to be a registered business, it has a proper registration in the jurisdiction it operates in/from. www.opencorporates.com  is a great tool for this.
Make sure the place you're going to be buying from has a good standing within the community. If they have a Trustpilot, look at it, and if they have a very low number of reviews ensure those reviews are almost, if not all, positive.
Interact with their support, sales support is quite literally just a tool for businesses to show themselves in their best light, so take advantage of this and have their sales team give you suggestions and help with choosing a package or a service. If they don't have a sales team, that's your cue to leave. If their sales team seems inexperienced or incompetent, that is also your cue to leave.
Use common sense; if it's free to use don't expect the same data redundancy that Equinix would give you, oftentimes free "hosts" aren't scummy at all instead unrealistic expectations are set of what they provide.
If their website/logo/branding/terms/discord/anything looks off, or generic, or copy-pasted, or anything negative, then leave.
Jamie_ - I am like 90% sure plex is just badsk on a new account. Doing the same things, speaks the same, designs logos and websites the same.
Tato - europa wrong thread
TheDevil - Jamie_ lol 😂
Gamingrock - Fuck plex
