JAY - this host said they sold me an I9-9900k node with 64GB ram and 500GB HDD storage for £45 = $60 

me and my staff was wondering why the node was so slow for any kind of Node  so we kept asking and wondering why it was so slow and they managed to help a bit but one day we just get tired of it and check SSH console to see specs turns out they put us on an Intel Xeon CPU and we had never been on I9-9900k at all acording to josh {Owner of Quack host} so we ask why and apparently they said there node hasnt been recieved and they didnt inform us about it at all

so we ask for a refund and they say yes and then 2 days later all staff ignore us and wont refund us a cent at all so they expect paypal to pay there debt XD

JAY - Oh and i forgot to say i borrowed £5 from j0sh and got it cheaper for pre-payment for the node so this has gone on for some time
Tomas - After reading over their ToS, they don't give refunds. You really should read the ToS before making any purchases. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-01-18/1610983333-216023-image.png
Deleted User - You should win the PayPal dispute.
Detective_Alpha - At this point the Xeons are better then their current shit :3
Detective_Alpha - Tomas Lmfao well at least they gave
J0SH - woah whats the quackhost mention for
Detective_Alpha - J0SH He was mentioning you as in "Josh from quackhost"
J0SH - There is a whole side to this story. it is bullshit. I can't be arsed typing an essay about what happened here, firstly refunds can take up to 14 days, I said I would refund you out of my own money as the tilted PayPal didn't have the funds to pay JAY, He ignored this and proceeded to make this post.
J0SH - Detective_Alpha I have eyes i know what he said
J0SH - Firstly you chosen to get WHMCS credit instead of a refund, so firstly I could've chosen not to refund you as you chose to get credit and that can not be reversed.
Ryder - Tomas unfortunately that wont help since you are not getting what you paid for. He can still go on a dispute and win it
BabyAces - This company is a good company. I do host one of there VPS for them, and they give me something back. They have never scammed me and I do NOT now what this person is talking about. I recommend deleting this forum because it's not true and everything they say is not relevant.
Detective_Alpha - BabyAces Indeed, all of my friends bought directly from J0sh and they all had positive reviews :3
Detective_Alpha - Lmfao thinking about it rn, you kinda did fraud because u adverted those nodes as nodes with "NVME"
Detective_Alpha - Not on the vps reselling tab but in the mc,discord bot and rest :3
Tilted - Sam He should but the thing is he didn't even mention the part about how he wanted to take the WHMCS credit and then all of a sudden ask for a PayPal refund and puts a distribute within 24 hours of him asking.
Detective_Alpha - indeed
Detective_Alpha - btw proof about them advertising as having NVME but actually having a HDD xD - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-01-20/1611163811-860649-image.png
Tilted - Detective_Alpha Thank you but it's not up there anymore https://clientarea.navohosting.net/cart.php
Detective_Alpha - Tilted Yes ik,they got rid of it the second u gave them the refund
J0SH - what
when did we say it was nvme
Deleted User - J0SH It's right there in the screenshot
Detective_Alpha - J0SH forever xD
Tilted - J0SH we didn't navo hosting was false advertising
Detective_Alpha - J0SH never :3
JAY - hey here is the story -

Tilted - JAY 
Did you think about why I did this your host is corrupt your coo is legit taking money from a streamer and calling it his.
what happened to the cancer that TMKC says he has? 
When I figured this out I was honestly sick to my stomach. 
He comes and ask me for money and says he's poor and he needs help paying for his bill well wow I call bull shit because how can he pay for this new ryzen 7 node when he has bills to pay.
Also next time maybe next time stick to your word.
You say you want to make the refund by whmcs but boom 2 days later we get a dispute put on us. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-01-23/1611391755-843458-screen-shot-2021-01-22-at-12532-pm.png

TMKC - Tilted How I get money for my server box is none of your concern. I am diagnosed with breast cancer and I asked for donations to help paying for it. People donated, I got enough to pay half of the treatments because of that, which I am very grateful for.

That I have a server box, is from other sources. How do you know where I get money from? I work 2 jobs and every penny I have to spare goes towards the server box that I have.

You are such a damn asshole for using my cancer diagnose to attempt to win a case.  That is just low.
JAY - TMKC he is just salty because he didnt get his %25 cut because he is negative on his paypal and his host is going to sh**t
