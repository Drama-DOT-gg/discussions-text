quacky - Hi before I start I would like to make it clear that this is my first time posting so don't give me your toxic behaviors right now.. 

Anyways I met this guy !techdude1610 his is id 581855280770580490. So basically I worked on a botlist for discord with him, then I suddenly released that techdude likes to ping people a lot in announcements and is very immature. So I asked him if he was underage, and after some convincing he admitted he was underage. I have some proof 
and that's proof he admitted it him self. And he is proof he Is immature: 

(he said that his parents don't have there id on them, which is illegal beacuse he said he went on a long road trip and they can't drive without license)

Also another thing Is he banned me for threating to stab him, but is reality we were just talking about what being forced mean and I used the example as someone trying to stab someone but he spread it was a rumor and said I was stabbing him.

He also thinks that asking someone for proof like a photo id is against the discord tos. Which isn't, he could've just said no.. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-02/1625236134-134264-screen-shot-2021-06-30-at-112726-am.png

Dennis - quacky wasn't this the dude that owned a botlist or something, i recognise the name, and you to be exact
TheAmazonGuy - quacky  so I am not being toxic but here is some thing I would want to say

I believe in the TOS it says you have to be 13 years old and older and you can be underage but a parent or guardian has to know  

Techdude  said 

I donâ€™t think they have there ID either

Itâ€™s not illegal to not have a ID so idk where you got that from maybe to much Patty mayo or some shit

you said 

he said that his parents don't have there id on them, which is illegal beacuse he said he went on a long road trip and they can't drive without license)

The screen shots here does not show you that he did say that. 

you have no proof to get this guy in jail or report it to the police 

He can ban you from his server for what ever he wants there Does not have to be a valid reason, he can ban you.

also how tf do you suspect someone pinging a lot of times being under age
BenCollins - I'm new to this thing. I don't know how to change my username.       HOW
Toki0179 - quacky I mean, yes he's underage. But, I don't see why you'd be reporting him to the police. Why would he want to send his parents' ID? Ah yes, lets send a picture of their ID which has their address on it to some random stranger on the internet, sounds totally safe. Just report him to Discord and move on, don't make it such a big deal honestly. Also light mode ew.
Toki0179 - BaconHead Stay quiet you have a roblox profile pic
quacky - Toki0179 Yeah, I dont know why I wrote that. I wasn't anyways reporting him to police
Toki0179 - quacky Then why were you telling him you were going to. That just seems like a dick move to me.
quacky - Toki0179  Yep.
