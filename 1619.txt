lgamerlive_ - Just an reminder for all the kids,

NO, you can't get any free nitro by clicking on free nitro links in your dms or in a server.
Just to be safe, install an antivirus (i suggest WannaCry.exe, awsome software!) on your PC and turn off you DM's. Stay safe!

Oh, and if you find any of these scam links, paste them here and ill "review" them (on my VM ofcourse)
Robert - Sorry, but Drama.gg's goal is to expose fraudulent companies and people. I get that this is a wide-spread problem, hence why I will lock this thread - not delete it, but this is not really the thread we want.
