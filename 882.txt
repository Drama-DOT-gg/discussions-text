tan_playz - Hey guys I've seen a few talk bad about hye and I wanted to know if its okay to trust his new hosting service called enzonet? Because I have a server there and I can't really take local backups so all I can do is rely on server backups but I'm not sure if its save to use it without your confirmation!
Robert - I'd suggest staying away from Hye and his hosts, there are multiple threads on Drama.gg which should (if I recall correctly) explain why.
calcal - hye funny moment https://www.reddit.com/r/ShitAmericansSay/comments/p44duu/trump_is_our_lord_and_saviour/
SoftyDuck - tan_playz I use Enzonet and dont see a problem with it.
Caldeira - I'm co-owner on an smp that changed to enzonet as the hosting provider and it has been reliable and seems to be good quality, ofc there is always the possibility of it being a scam in terms of selling data n stuff but as far as the hosting itself goes it seems fine
calcal - hye doesnt believe in climate change
tan_playz - Hye is being an idiot tbh I've seen 2 people talk to hye in #general chat about the native miner not working in windows and all he says is "you're wrong" 1 of em even suggested him to check it on a VM and when he did he said "Oh I guess xmrig 5 doesn't work on windows" and when he didn't check yet he said "mac and windows have same miners". He literally used that excuse to avoid checking the issue and later when he did give a file to download 1 of the 2 could download it and the other couldn't download it and hye just ignored it even after seeing a screenshot of the download denied page. I don't even know what hye is planning to do with enzonet with this lack of support.

All I can say is if Hye stops acting like a kid which he is because I haven't seen an adult continue an argument when they think the opponent is wrong.

Tell me your views on this, I'm just shocked witnessing the chat of 2 users and Hye
Hye - I was wrong about the miner. So what? I issued a fix already.

People are incorrect about things sometimes, that's life. No one is every always correct.

Also for you to even say that I used an avoid checking the issue is absolutely ridiculous. I launched a VM and extensively tested the miner after they tried the steps in the AntiVirus which I instructed (which failed)
calcal - Hye i have a few stupid msgs from u aswell lmfao 'if climate change is real why did texas freeze'
Hye - This is not the place for politics, also that's not an accurate quote, I said global warming, not climate change.
Hye - Well it is real, just not to the degree that politicians like to say that it is. Enough politics.
Tomas - Hye "Instead of "climate change" the preferred terms are "climate emergency, crisis or breakdown" and "global heating" is favoured over "global warming," although the original terms are not banned."
calcal - - ableist much?

Kowone - calcal ah, as usual, endermined still attached to his big man the donald duck
calcal - Kowone yh i have more dumb shit like this but cba
Kowone - calcal beware, endermined and his shitty beliefs can destroy you
calcal - Kowone tell me about it, i was in a gc w him before he left, thats how i have all these screenshots
tan_playz - If he was matured as he stated he wouldn't reply to every message that offends him or includes him because thats something a kid would do "a raged kid"
Simply - Uh I enzonet too it's good I guess
Simply - I use*
tan_playz - I disagree with the opinion on USA being the best country when you can literally see most of the karens/racist in there which changed my mind and I don't feel like going to USA anymore once I get enough to travel but instead I'd rather go to an Asian country or a European country. 

Well donald trumpt was good but it doesn't change the fact that USA has the most racists/karens on earth
calcal - tan_playz doesnt believe climate change is real because of what happened to texas in like early march
tan_playz - calcal lol, at final what I can say about enzonet is enzonet is a good hosting to use as didn't have any data losses or anything but hye is 12, like wtf he argues like a kid I bet atleast a 1 start hosting's owner is better than hye and his stuborness
calcal - tan_playz he also destroyed heimsnet, loads of meetings were just people shouting at him for dumb shit he did
tan_playz - bruh its like talking to a raged kid lol but let me tell you something enzonet support are shit like when I asked my friends first they told me they used to reply first but stopped replying untill recently like the miner doesn't even work properly and we have to keep reopening it untill it doesn't work anymore, I'm thinking it was cuz the client panel isn't available anymore but they should have been able to tell is atleast about it like lol I for real think enzonet is a kids made host and is alive only cuz he hasn't given access to others to cause data loss or node loss like badsk or galaxic host owners
