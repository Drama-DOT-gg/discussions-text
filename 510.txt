Ricardo - So you wan't to start hoaxing?
Here is my guide:

1 - Find a hoaxable host
Disboard is a great website to search for free hoaxable hosts!
Just use the FREE-HOSTING tag  or search for free hosting
As you see, lots of hostings are advertised there!


We recommend hoaxing little hostings that aren't a registered company, normally with these errors:
Freenom domain (.tk, .ml, .ga, .cf, .gq)
No TOS and PP
Bad Uptime
Datalosess
Underage Owner
(You can hoax any host but with a valid reason)

2 - Recollect information
Join the discord server and start recollecting info.
We recommend having at least this information:
Domain Information
Node Information
Discord Server Invite (Better disboard URL if they delete your invite)

3 - Start a drama.gg thread
You can guide you on this step with one of my hoax, NexusNodes

4 - Enjoy!
Remember to use Grammarly for the better composition of threads! - https://i.imgur.com/lrCudED.png
FatGrizzly - üëçÔ∏è  Please always try to dm/create a ticket to first inform the owner about the flaws, most host owners love to improve their service, its always good to inform them first as the situation may be resolved right there
MysteriousK69 - Great guide, adding on to it, I would suggest you look at the advertisements channel and everyone's status in Dashactyl's support server. Its quite easy to find hoax able hosts there.
