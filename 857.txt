DeadBush - Ok I found a hosting the owner adv in my dm


They use freenom domain lmao 




uses arc for afk against arc tos


They use privacy policy generator do they even read the privacy policy which was generated? cuz ig they have no idea what is their privacy policy themselves



when i asked about privacy policy to owner



they have 2 8GB contabo nodes (nothing bad with contabo) but they have 1/4 of the disk as swap 8GB ram and 50GB swap like wtf isnt that over the limits and I bet they are overallocating too 



Tos: I think they used generator for this as well but they didnt mention but user generated content on a MC server host?  im confused
