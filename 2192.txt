Below are screenshots about proof of abuse of Google cloud 


Black PR, a raid on another hosting was used to attract other users:

Evidence of PR message: 

Evidence that they pinged twinks 


Children think that they are grandfathers when in fact the billing was turned off. 




Proof to message technical service (Billing)

I recommend not using abusive hosting, especially when children manage the hosting. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-09-21/1695280695-390574-screenshot-20230921-101547-chrome.jpg

DarkNight81 - I agree tbh
SoSad - Mafix Can you translate the discord messages + A screenshot of the nodes isnt really proof of anything
PadowYT2 - some other proof:

(from discord.gg/pterodactyl) - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-09-21/1695319164-664993-screenshot-20230921-205606.jpg
SoSad - PadowYT2 Nah this shit mad funny i dont care if people null stuff or whatever but to be exposed like this is hella funny
ast3risk - Once again, please provide any message/site links where possible (ex. the link to that query from the first image, or the statuspage, or the host's site). Mafix
Mafix - ast3risk 

links as you asked: 
https://panel.justnodes.fun 
https://dsc.gg/justnodes

they do not have a status page or billing
ast3risk - Mafix How about the check from the first screenshot, or links to those messages?
ast3risk - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-09-21/1695280695-390574-screenshot-20230921-101547-chrome.jpg This check.

ast3risk - Mafix This is actually the search URL. 

https://search.censys.io/search?resource=hosts&amp;sort=RELEVANCE&amp;per_page=25&amp;virtual_hosts=EXCLUDE&amp;q=justnodes.fun
PadowYT2 - they even admit to raid servers:


deepl translation as cba to translate it myself:
Good evening Dear Members Today and yesterday we Raided A couple of large scale Hosting Ani dudos free panel if you are wondering Why?
Ani is weak for us.
That's why all the tariffs you see in the No Access categories. 
Any tariff 30% off
Icho little bonus Any tariff when you buy Characteristics increase in x2.
There are 5 pieces of blanket panel so don't worry there will be no dudos on them üôÇ .
I make such a discount for you that you would buy a lot of tariffs and make your own beautiful servers and that –±–∏–ª you have onl
@here@everyone 
If you want to buy write to üé´ticket
Saaryn | Tech. JN Support - MC - Yesterday at 6:17 pm
Hello, today ddos attacks from large scale hosting sites that we raid. Attacks go mainly on free node, so if you want stability take tariffs, because for money we will do anything that your servers were in uptime as instasamka which says for money yes!!!!! Well you get the hint üòâ

ItzScripts-ItzSab - Mafix yk, i dont know much context about this nor am i defending anybody directly, but just because somebody is using GCP doesn't mean its automatically abusing lol
Mafix - ItzScripts-ItzSab 

Hmm, but their free plan has 8 GB of frames and 1 core of 20 disks, and do you seriously think that this is not an abuse?
ast3risk - Mafix The stats of a free plan can be a red flag, but alone don't prove anything.
Mafix - ast3risk 
are you serious now? I wrote an abuse letter and they turned off 1 of the locations. What can you say to this, and let‚Äôs also take as an example such a person as Badks, Layer. If he did that, then everyone would write an abuse, but it wouldn‚Äôt be an abuse. Judge for yourself, if they had money, they would use other providers, but definitely not Google, and they also say that they have 5 panels and they don‚Äôt care, but when they dosa their donor, users complained about the inaccessibility of the panel, they also sell it under the guise of i9 xeon

En &gt; Dear participants! Our hosting will restore free nodes on Monday, since we do not have time to do it so quickly. And we have more good news: a paid option will be added.

That is, you will understand that they have been given an abuse and they will restore their work. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-09-25/1695667880-348350-image.png

ItzScripts-ItzSab - Mafix wdym by if they had money they wouldnt use Google? I use GCP for stuff, Discord uses GCP, etc.
Mafix - ItzScripts-ItzSab 
We went to the military with them, there was clearly a non-paying audience there
See how much 128 GB frames cost there?
ast3risk - Discord does use GCP: https://radar.cloudflare.com/scan/38c17a07-e0b4-4a5f-b64d-8210b26f8f22/technology

So, that alone doesn't mean it's a scam.
