KylePlays - Hello, Everyone

ATTENTION:
Just wanted to clarify somethings, I don't mean to do this thread but I just wanted you guys option for the hosting

=========================================

So, It started when I saw "Alpha RDP" As like a company right, So I joined the server I see no Privacy Policy or Return-Refund Policy, So I message in the mainhall that where's the Privacy-Polivy and the Return-Refund Policy Here's our conversation.

Just trying to take caution on Owners of an hosting that should be careful before making public your hosting.

Cheers,

Yie - KylePlays about the screenshot about "tos" he sent, it's not a tos, but it's a rule
KylePlays - Yie

KylePlays - And to be fair, Using Azure is good but if you buy a RDP There's no way you find on where's or who on how they manage your Data on their hosting right?
Jedrik - They use Azure free credits + sell azure accounts (probably .edu's)
Jedrik - kek
LazyKing - Is it a scam to sell azure or aws rdp's? (Im admin there) is there a problem in selling those ? Yeah ik those are free credits but not all can crack some are beginners in the community so we can't do business ? ... And regarding host and data privacy we never mentioned we host those rdp's we clearly mentioned those are azure n aws rdp's and yeah we won't provide refund but we can provide replacement. Refunds will be provided only when we fail to provide RDP. Is there anything wrong ? We no rich to buy those colocation providers so we started something where people are happy with our service. What is the issue here can I know ?
LazyKing - @KylePlays discord - LazyKing#8708 dm me and ask Jessi is a noob
Chirag - LazyKing you're making money from free stuff. You're abusing a service to make money. You aren't even paying for it.
Don't open a host if you aren't rich enough.
Ash777 - you can just by dedicated servers and sell vps from them no need to buy the hardware
BrendansAtWork - Not taking sides here but you realise sole trading is completely legal, you don't need to file and incorporate your company to operate it.
BrendansAtWork - LazyKing On Azure, it's not and it is, and it's especially not allowed to resell any subscription balance which includes free trial credits.
Not sure about AWS we don't use them
AlphaDefault - BrendansAtWork Bro you made that post on my bday
