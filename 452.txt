Prudentia - I recently met a person named CloudBud (known as SpikyCord in drama.gg). He asked if he could help me with the new host I'm making. I agreed and let him become management, I later received a dm from one of my friends who informed me that CloudBud was "immature". My experience with CloudBud for the last 3 hours went against that, but I removed his management role and I went into his connected social media accounts. After searching for a while on drama.gg, I found his Tikok which is very cringe (https://www.tiktok.com/@[Some content here may have been removed by the Drama.gg team]?lang=en). [Update: He has deleted all his videos from his tiktok]. He posts several videos about him moving his camera over the announcements he makes on his discord server. I asked him about it and he claimed it was his brother, and his brother had his discord login info. I was skeptical, but I went along with it. One thing I found on his tiktok was that he was struggling to eat a single taki (JUST ONE). I left his tiktok which has now been deleted (all the videos have) which is very sus. I spent a while going through his twitter and found a bunch of weird stuff. But before I get into that, heres some more stuff. Before this whole thing, I asked him if he was a Roblox game developer, he said "I don't, but my brother does". I then went to his twitter and found several tweets going to games on roblox asking "Can I develop for you". Then, I asked him to invite me to Poly Hosting server (his host I think). He replied saying he deleted it/doesn't exist. I found the discord widget on his twitch and it showed people online on his server. I showed him that and he said, "why do you want to join". That was a big red flag. Now I'll show pictures and everything to let you know, (Btw, hes a furry)

Prudentia - I recently met a person named CloudBud (known as SpikyCord in drama.gg). He asked if he could help me with the new host I'm making. I agreed and let him become management, I later received a dm from one of my friends who informed me that CloudBud was "immature". My experience with CloudBud for the last 3 hours went against that, but I removed his management role and I went into his connected social media accounts. After searching for a while on drama.gg, I found his Tikok which is very cringe (https://www.tiktok.com/@[Some content here may have been removed by the Drama.gg team]?lang=en). [Update: He has deleted all his videos from his tiktok]. He posts several videos about him moving his camera over the announcements he makes on his discord server. I asked him about it and he claimed it was his brother, and his brother had his discord login info. I was skeptical, but I went along with it. One thing I found on his tiktok was that he was struggling to eat a single taki (JUST ONE). I left his tiktok which has now been deleted (all the videos have) which is very sus. I spent a while going through his twitter and found a bunch of weird stuff. But before I get into that, heres some more stuff. Before this whole thing, I asked him if he was a Roblox game developer, he said "I don't, but my brother does". I then went to his twitter and found several tweets going to games on roblox asking "Can I develop for you". Then, I asked him to invite me to Poly Hosting server (his host I think). He replied saying he deleted it/doesn't exist. I found the discord widget on his twitch and it showed people online on his server. I showed him that and he said, "why do you want to join". That was a big red flag. Now I'll show pictures and everything to let you know, (Btw, hes a furry)

Spikycord - Imagine talking shit.
Sydney - Quick note:

I can personally confirm that CloudBud is over the age of 13. I have verified with multiple sources (3), and all of them point to him being over 13.

Do not bring me into this drama
_Player1 - Spikycord He is talking facts gavin. All of this is true because your name in BlueFox Hosting is Gavin and your push all this crap to your brother. Your a 11 year old little boy who is trying to be cooler then everybody else then it all backfires because your underage. Come back to discord in 2 years 😄
_Player1 - Sydney He is not 13 bro. HIS FACEBOOK account prooves it LMAO
Ricardo - Prudentia oh, cloudbud the kid that started a discussion about me, saying that i am racist and toxic other a few things...
he is like 11, on vc it lit sounds like 10 yr old kid
_Player1 - Ricardo fax
Ricardo - _Player1 ?
Sydney - _Player1 You checked his facebook. I checked county records... who wins there?

Doesn't Facebook delete accounts that are under 13 years old?
Prudentia - Sydney Facebook doesn't have the time to go through those many accounts, they basically don't care about it now. Also, I would like to see the "county records".
Prudentia - I think I provided enough proof that he's under 13, its clearer then my vision.
Prudentia - Also, UPDATE TIMEEEE

He has blocked me on discord 

And, his new name is 

ID: 792919303862747146

His social media accounts may have been removed from his profile
@Sydney He's clearly trying to hide himself now - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-05/1620253330-382040-image.png

Deleted User - eraters yea, but still true.
Prudentia - ShinyPlasm Not sherlock, I used Twint
Prudentia - I don't give a fuck about coppa, and you're saying I should sell his information, not give it for free. Also that's just twitter messages, I have no idea about his number, exact location and such.
Deleted User - Prudentia His face is still out there, which is against COPPA.
Deleted User - Prudentia kids tryna scam people now

Kids can do ANYTHING &amp; GET AWAY WITH IT!
Deleted User - Prudentia playing an mature game (bitlife):

Bitlife can be played for people by all ages &amp; is not "mature ", as you seen to presume.
Deleted User - Prudentia You gave away his town (MN), Name (Gavin from his tiktok) &amp; All of his social media accounts &amp; WHAT HIS FACE LOOKS LIKE!, to the people of Drama.gg free of cost.

Get that straight, he can contact the police &amp; get this post &amp; shit deleted, THIS POST IS VIOLATING COPPA!!, DRAMA.GG &amp; YOU CAN BE SUED &amp; HELP RELIABLE!! GET THAT STRAIGHT BITCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Prudentia - @25#13415 fucking dumbass - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-06/1620309555-772686-image.png
Sydney - Prudentia 

Hey! I will not be giving you the county records, due to them having his full address, school, full name, etc. You don't need them.
eraters - Sydney Then your proof is invalid as you have no way to show to us that he is above the age of 13
Sydney - eraters I am not doxing Gavin...
Trxppy - bruh wtf is this
Prudentia - Sydney So you know all his information, and you're not a part of his family in any way.
Nova - what is this
Nova - Imagine being underage smh can't relate JK JK JK KJK JKJ KJK 🤣
Nova - what does being underaged even do
Iceey - I'm coming across a few difficulties trying to accumulate people that seemed to ask.
z_t0ht - lmfao drama.gg is gonna get taken down
z_t0ht - z_t0ht 100% your posting someone's face without permission
FC5570 - z_t0ht show me where it was posted?
Prudentia - z_t0ht It's already online dumbass. His face is on tiktok and facebook. Why the fuck would they not get coppa'd
Prudentia - gottem: 

Removed by @Jedrik
BaconHead - Prudentia I mean tbh I don't find any problem with you making a host at 12 but you can't just violate discord tos and be under 13
quacky - Can confirm Cloudbud (aka Lumberbud) will be leaving discord. 

What he sent me:


Dear, Quacky I am sorry about all this fighting and drama and stuff. I am leaving Discord in a day. I think Leaving Discord is a better place for me. I've been in so much drama and stuff here. And I don't like this drama. I hope you know I am sorry about everything. I hope you and everyone in crazybotlist knows this and see this. 
It was fun and makes happy being apart with Crazybotlist/Discordlists.
As I was thinking I be here on Discord anymore. It was very cool to meet you here on Discord. I hope you all have a fun/better summer.
BaconHead - Do we lock this or what
Seer - Prudentia 
Hey!
Thanks for posting this, i have once nearly been scammed by this person, they made an absurd request:
200 USD for a discord bot list
They didn't want to pay first and wanted me to put it on Glitch/Repl which you can see the code on.

This alarmed me, but i did do it, so i made a screenshot (Blurring the project name &amp; id)
After this i deleted it and sent them the screenshot.
Just like i thought they wanted the link to see if it was the actual project.
BaconHead - Seer lol almost no one will spend 200$ on a bot
quacky - Seer whats your discord? beacuse he is very famous for that scam.
Ricardo - Nova CloudBud is a skid that defended NexusNodes and made a TOTALLY FALSE post about me, saying that I am racist, toxic and the drama queen (last one true)...
Also he is 11
Nova - Ricardo ok ;-;
BaconHead - He left discord ok we can now lock this there's no point of talking about stuff he did he literally left now he's probably involved in a different community
MrTechy - Also he banned me from a host for no exact reason at all and he's not gone. . - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-23/1624488826-211462-screenshot-20210623-185251-discord.jpg

quacky - MrTechy He did it for a reason... He didn't want to have any beef with you. So stop pissing lumberbud and go away.
MrTechy - quacky I didnt even do anything to him, I dont remember
quacky - MrTechy Yeah that's fine, he just doesn't want anything to do with drama.gg as a whole. Not just you.
Connor200024 - Would like to point out, that he "claimed" some code that was leaked by someone and used that in idk 5 bot lists... Soon as one of us joins he blocked us and didn't say a thing.... I proved my points to him in dms and he still didn't understand he took code.... But hey idc anymore.... He is just known to be hated in the Developers Community... Yeah you guys can what back him up saying oh he hasn't done a thing.... Yeah okay whatever.....

He took a bot lists code, Has just what now raided a good friends of mine his Bot List... Soon as I go to DM him he blocked me...

And you guys want to be friends with him LMFAO grow up!

I agree with every point that has been said...

He also failed to DDOS one of my websites (Was funny ngl) someone doesn't know what an IP Spam does but my server knows well to block it........ 😀 

So I guess he is the most hated person in the Developer Community and Discord.... Should be reported tbh...... But hey I guess Discord won't do anything? ✌
Dlsnhw3 - Connor200024  he found them on glitch.com  so??
Connor200024 - Dlsnhw3 🤔 Even so, no credits or anything soooo..........
Connor200024 - FlaringPhoenix I'm not, just wanted to say what i think about "him"....
MrOrangeSunshine - Just as a heads up, I believe he is going by the name RainyBows (and Randomx24) now, Rainybows joined our discord wanting to join our programming team, and I asked for any examples of work, the Github he shared was Lumberbud (Now Changed to Randomx24) he was less than forthcoming about his skills and what he had actually done work on. after doing a little digging I stumbled upon this thread and wanted to add my added information. Attached below are his Discord Profile, Old and new Github Profiles. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-15/1626316667-869100-dasc.png

Kitty - I knew CloudBud in the past and I didn't even think he was underage.
pwned - @28#13419 dad is gone.
LemonDrp2 - Oh I remember this when people started doxxing me and leaked my ip and face and address and more.
LemonDrp2 - Prudentia that doesn’t matter. Should I go around taking photos or saving photos of you and just put it all over here and social media.?
pwned - LemonDrp2 Do you not realize that this thread is fucking old.
LemonDrp2 - pwned do you fucking think I give too fucks
pwned - LemonDrp2 Two* and yes, I think you give two fucks because you cared enough to reply to my comment 8 days later.
