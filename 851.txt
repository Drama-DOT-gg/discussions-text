Aaron_ - IoNetty Edit: My ticket was closed for no reason 2 seconds after when I had a valid question.

Don't worry you are not the only one.
Aaron_ - Rembison doesn't know how to run a host and is really childish.
Loser - lol
Grabstop - Loser If you are considering this a laughable manner please do check this survey, its not advertising just thought that it might interest someone like you.
Loser - Grabstop I hovered over it and its a youtube link so I'm not gonna click it cuz I'm not an idiot like you but nice try on rickrolling me LMAO
Aaron_ - Loser Thank you for ruining the joke.
Loser - Aaron_ No Problem ðŸ˜„ ðŸ˜…
