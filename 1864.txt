Ibrahim - Recently, SHARADðŸ–¤#6969 (User ID 797512607077498920, created Discord account  Sat, 09 Jan 2021 17:10:22 UTC) has come back to the Hosting community after taking a leave for a while.

To start, he openly admitted to abusing Hetzner and Contabo. He sent his VPS IPs to me, showed screenshots and just bragged so much about them as he liked them The Contabo i unfortunately have no evidence of, cause he didn't really share any proof. He also abuses United Domains 

Now about the carding, he bragged to me that he managed to get his Minecraft for free using a BIN which he got from some Server for Invite Rewards and he used a Checker that charges 1$ to each card to verify. That is realllllly bad ngl.. He also used SEPA Direct Debit for Hetzner and Contabo using a Fake IBAN. He also signed up for Kubbur i think

He also DDOSed me once for no reason, yet it didn't really affect me much since my router has really good DDOS protection.

And like, this skid is no ordinary skid. Rather then lying, he straight up admits to everything lmao... He leaked tons of his personal information in the Drama.gg Discord Server like a month back for no reason, whenever someone said "Sharad give you dad's ____" he would give it.  This lasted for an hour lol, check "from:797512607077498920" on the server to see it all

Also apparently he will lawsuit whoever drama.gg's him, lmaooaooaoaooaoaoaoa

Hetcon - hey, I would need proper evidence that its actually carded, Uniteddomains and Hetzner can be abused from IBAN.
Ibrahim - Hetcon im not sure if he carded or used iban for united domains ngl, and hetzner he did with iban ik
Robert - He also tried carding at KUBBUR, https://tickets.kubbur.com/d95644ac-0e86-4862-89fe-934b6ca26667
Ibrahim - Robert tf - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-03-28/1648487555-211175-image.png
Hetcon - and as far as my knowledge charging "BINS" actually is not illegal since it is a bug in the bank's system and bank doesn't get debitted for it, It just gives a success message thats it,  "BIM" means "Bank Identification Number" and some banks either don't use them or have closed them but has not informed the issuing companies so its basically bugged and there is "Extraps" which is "BIN" but extended. "BIN" consists of 6 digits but "Extraps" consists of more which shows that bank has a bug in of of their card systems. Like 456789 is the "BIN" and "Extrap" defines that imagine this is the card model, "Personal Bank Ibra" = 4567896969 and "Sharad something" = 4567896789 and one of them is bugged so they just display charged message but its not.

Hetcon - Ibrahim As far as I know, you cannot actually know the balance in the card
Ibrahim - Hetcon Thing is, he actually bought stuff with it. and he aint charging the bins hes generating cards
Ibrahim - Hetcon true, but using stripe and other providers you can charge 1$ onto them
Robert - Hetcon Well, he is still carding (which is illegal)
Hetcon - Ibrahim He did buy stuff, but he actually isn't generating cards, he is generating bugged cards which cause 0 damage to the bank
Hetcon - Robert I don't actually, I just have the knowledge.
Ibrahim - Hetcon Are you sure about that?
Hetcon - Ibrahim They simply return a success message.
Hetcon - Ibrahim I am, it is impossible to generate cards.
Hetcon - Robert Its called binning not carding.
Robert - Since this has just become a discussion between 2 kids, I will be locking this. If you have anything else to add, DM me on Discord: Roberto#1762
Ibrahim - Hetcon just wanted to add a last note to that discussion so u could probs re open it, "He charges the cards 1.00$, then uses them for whatever he wants. He isn't simply using them for cards or just using a Luhn algrorithm checker, he is charging and generating cards from BINs. He isn't abusing a loophole, hes doing something different"
Ibrahim - also it is possible to generate cards and in fact is way too easy
the method people do is generate 500-1000 cards and then check them
Robert - Ibrahim The issue with that is that stuff like the CVV and the date won't match up.
Ibrahim - Robert which is why he generates so many
masterlord - Using bins, and check them using1$ charge and using in a lot of places until the bank's system flags it, they are not real cards.
masterlord - Robert True, but usually bins and extraps are supplied in a format the bin|month|year|cvv
Ibrahim - masterlord I know all about it.
Ibrahim - Some BINs some with CVV and Billing Address with it aswell

eg

bin: 2892y376928139u8y83fh83h8hfy7g4y90898984729737xxxx
exp: 02/25
cvv: rnd
Ibrahim - masterlord then they would get rejected
jxoljbq - Ibrahim No, banks have bugs.
Ibrahim - Ibrahim with usually the error GENERIC DECLINED or YOUR CARD NUMBER IS INCORRECT
Ibrahim - jxoljbq Maybe then, i am not sure. all i know is its illegal
Robert - jxoljbq Please don't make alternate accounts, thank you.
xaxaxa10 - Ibrahim that is why extrap comes in place, to replace your card number is incorrect and generic declined means high risk in stripe's system, now bye
SHARADYTINDIA - That wasn't me , you have no proof it was me doing that,..
SHARADYTINDIA - My friend Aditya will give you tight slap so don't mess me

Ibrahim - SHARADYTINDIA ummmmm in your literal trust pilot review (https://trstp.lt/qvJIm-6tK) you put an Imgur Link (https://imgur.com/a/beYb3cI) which literally shows you sending the card information which looks exactly like the ticket
