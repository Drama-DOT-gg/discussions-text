Drake - Let me introduce you to HostNexxus, LLC. HostNexxus, LLC (as per their twitter) is "A Low cost, Easy to Maintain Discord Bot &amp; Shared Website Hosting Company." According to their most recent Discord announcement they have been around since August of 2020. This is credible by looking through their Discord.

Let me introduce myself. Hi! I'm Drake, otherwise known as DaDrake#7921. While I believe everyone has a chance to correct themselves, I don't believe that it should be at the cost of others. In this case, let me introduce you into why I believe HostNexxus, LLC is "unprofessional", committing "Illegal Activites", and whatever else I set the topic tag as.

Unprofessional &amp; Illegal Activites. Upon joining their Discord I was greeted with an interesting overview. 

Nothing out of the ordinary, but it looks respectful at best. They do happen to do Discord tickets, which is scummy, but otherwise typical of a Discord host. I digress, onto the more pressing matters.
I asked about their LLC status, (NV20201890838) and why the status had changed from "active" to "default". I was met with abusive comments from their partner Itszylus and from one of their staff members Colin. Colin who had repeatedly informed me that he was on his way out after submitting a 2 week notice, kept telling me to ignore it and stated that it was just an error. I kept asking about it, only to be met with a chat clearing and nothing happening. (If you did not know, in the state of Nevada where HostNexxus, LLC happens to be registered, if your LLC status turns to default, it means you didn't pay the state and your LLC is now invalid, and as a result, you must pay late fees, plus registration, plus submitting some other documents to reinstate your LLC.) Essentially, continuing to state that you hold an LLC, when you actually don't, seems a bit fraud-y (wouldn't you agree?).

Recently, HostNexxus, LLC happened to have a 16 hour downtime, and when pressed about this matter,  (downtime as posted in #status-announcements) the chat was cleared in both their #general and #status-announcements. It seems like they don't want to answer our questions because they don't know what they are doing. Here is the only response one of my partners received about the downtime. 

So, what do you guys think? I would consider this to be a fraudulent operation, ran by kids who don't understand what they are doing. As of now, I'm banned from their Discord but I would love to see the community go in and ask the same questions I have asked (mainly about falsely portraying as an LLC) and at least get them shut down.

Drake - Drake here, again.

I found out about their TrustPilot, which has some interesting reviews. 

"I have used HostNexxus for all of 2 months now and have had nothing but a bad experience with them. I had 2-3 days of downtime when I first purchased my VPS. We had our files corrupted, had to reinstall Windows, and we were left with 2 machines running on the same IP (something that should not happen). We initially did not receive the specs promised and were required to migrate our server to a whole new data center. The website is constantly down and makes it very hard to manage our products. We have recently inquired about purchasing a dedicated server and were told that we can have one "custom made". We had given our specs and were then quoted a price of $180 for an initial setup plus $65 a month. Upon further inquiry and speaking with Alt he then informed us that the initial price would be going up to $230, he had said the shipping would be quite expensive. He then informs us that the initial price would be going to $492, he very "generously" said he would allow us to spread this $492 across 2 months. Upon looking into the server we have found one with the same exact specifications and in the same location for shipping on eBay priced at only $149.99 with $48.74 shipping. With tax and shipping, the system would be around $329, leaving HostNexxus with a $163 profit margin. That margin is not including the $65 a month he wanted to charge to host the server, mind you a server that has no DDOS protection. This would be hosted out of Dallas, Texas where hosting costs are around $35 for the magnitude of that server, once again leaving HostNexxus with a $30 a month profit margin. Overall their service is extremely overpriced and is very low quality. I would not recommend HostNexxus to anyone that would utilize the server on a day to day basis."

"This company is absolutely terrible compared to other companies. This company has been out of stock for the last 7 MONTHS! They tried offering me a lower storage plan with hdd for the same price as an SSD plan with 200+gb. The owner has a huge ego and is over controlling over everything in his company. Other companies offer way better cpu specs, ram &amp; storage compared to other companies. This company also had issues with their login for months making their customers reset their password every time they did a log in. Steer far away from this company as they are unexperienced."

There are quite a few negative ones, but here are some positive ones...

"Amazing, trustworthy, quick and reliable support team with a great, friendly and talented executive, Alt T.

I've used this service for a long time now and I've never been disappointed in their service. I continue to use HostNexxus because of how good they are at solving issues in cases of whether something was to happen or not, but - also, their hosting comes with such great things.

I will continue being their customer.

HostNexxus is recommended to all those out there!"

"The Executive, Alt T. | CEO is an awesome and amazing person that was providing great communication skills and top quality support for whenever we needed it.

I've been using HostNexxus for a vast amount of months and the support team have never failed to provide their support and have never let me down.

I appreciate the team and hope for HostNexxus to continue growing, as deserved."

Something about these two reviews just seem forced. Would anyone else agree? They kind of seem to be an clone of each other.

TP: https://www.trustpilot.com/review/hostnexxus.com
Hyperz - I cannot speak any on the new Executive, as I like him as a person, and I trust him far more than I trust Alt. I have only used HostNexxus when the previous CEO was present (Alt). I cancelled my service with them, and 1 month after that cancellation, they still charged my card. The owner was very uncompliant until I had to talk about my personal life, and how I couldn't afford to lose $25 because my family medical bills, only then was he all of a sudden not extremely busy and turned off the "Auto-Pay" on PayPal that would have also charged my card the following month if it hadn't been turned off. The service I ordered didn't work anyways, hence why I cancelled with them, and their website was broken to the point that you couldn't even access your services, let alone your account. As-of the current reputation and present of this timeline, I cannot say whether to trust them or not, as I believe Alt sold the company to Cahill (new CEO). Otherwise Alt is a scumbag, lying, and overpricing shit bag.

Here is some proof on Alt trying to sell a dedicated server to a client for 




He pulled some really devious and despicable shit. After I left a review on their trust pilot, they then proceeded to delete my review with the reason "Didn't get a proper experience with the company/service." When I am pretty sure that I got a very good experience with the company / service.

As-far as the new CEO goes, I haven't seen anyone having any problems yet. I know the guy and he actually is pretty genuine. However with Alt, that kid shouldn't be anywhere near money, let alone his own. - https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/805940843193171987/808834816501612584/unknown.png

Drake - Here is a quote from the current CEO... Cahill

I have read the document. I only recently took over HostNexxus from the previous CEO and this was a very big welcome gift anyway I have reviewed the document taken In the issues I have conversed with the staff member that was originally talking to you, I have also gone over LLC papers now there were blatant disregard for organization so it took me a while however we are in contact with the company our llc registration was done through and we awaiting official response I will keep you informed I am not here to keep secrets this was a major miscommunications between myself and the previous ceo.

As of now, 10/22/2021, this is the current standing on the LLC (as reported by opencorporates)...


Additionally, I was told that I was unbanned from their Discord, however I am still banned :/

Another day in the life with bullshit responses trying to cover corporate asses. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-10-22/1634872647-522581-image.png
