Jen - That's right! They are being taken down by WHMCS! - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-09-09/1599663381-452497-image.png
HCS - Since itâ€™s a registered company of whmcs tried to sue they could close the company
Jen - HCS its not registered, My-licences.uk was not found in WHMCS database at all
And is being taken down as we speak for selling Pirated copys of WHMCS And fake Licences
Deleted User - Jen I think he means registered as a actual company
Jen - Update!
Apple Admitted that the keys don't start with whmcs- which means the keys are fake, All WHMCS keys that are real have that on the start of it - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-09-09/1599667162-811380-image.png
Jen - Another update! Just admitted again

A Customer Admitted that they start with licences- which means they are a pirated key - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-09-09/1599667249-403249-image.png

AYS - No not all whmcs licences start with WHMCS- so thats not a valid argument
Jen - @AYS According to WHMCS Pirate team it does.
Jen - @AYS I have had a lot of conversations with them to make sure this is valid
HCS - Jen It is a registered company with companies house.
eraters - Can you show us the registration for the company name Licenses2Host
Jen - @HCS Yeah your point is? Your giving me more information to give to the WHMCS for the take down, lmao your just helping me, Thanks so much
eraters - Also, I'd like that proof of registration for the company named Licenses2Host, since that's what their name is, that's what it has to be registered as.
HCS - Jen I was just saying.
HCS - eraters They are on companies house, not under that name but they don't need to be registered under that name.
Jen - @HCS Licenses2Host Does not a thing in the EU Justice Portal which would show all companies registered in the EU
The Company that showed when I typed Licenses2Host Says that, So now your lying - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-09-09/1599671119-635353-image.png
Jen - @HCS - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-09-09/1599671179-349044-image.png
HCS - Jen Not under that name, this is a stupid argument, I just pointed out they are registered.
Jen - Are they registered with comapny number
Company number 11616161
Jen - We asked Virtualizer we bought a Virt Licence from L2H And Virt verified it was fake
We are contacting other companies and reporting l2h For Doing cracked shit - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-09-09/1599671501-436879-unknown.png

Jen - @deleted yes I know, I already posted that
Jen - @HCS Also yes it does, Any valid licence with WHMCS Starts with whmcs-
Thats literally how its always been r u dumb.
Even cPanel partners have that, Thats how you know its real
deleted - Jen have wut
mxnugget - Jen Got the same answer at the ticket. Basically this is my old post continued.
Pamar - Jen not true on that one, there are few with OWNED- (for old customers which purchased onetime plans of whmcs which was offered by whmcs themself before), WEBHOST- (provided by webhost certified resellers) and probably there are few others out there.
Jen - Pamar How come WHMCS Support said so huh?
Jen - Explain how they say it, You can't argue with them they are way above you.
Pamar - Jen :shrug: Just saying what I know, you can google it.
Pamar - https://extralicense.com/uploads/monthly_2020_09/1943590316_Adsz.thumb.png.666831e4c8381878511b0d1a6d8121e4.png example
Jen - @Pamar Ok, So How come WHMCS says otherwise?
Jen - Can you explain why they would say that huh?
Pamar - Jen I do not know why whmcs says that okay? But the fact is about a lot of people own owned (onetime plan) licenses and it includes owned- in the license part! Same for webhost- and stuff.
Jen - Pamar we are not tlaking about the onetime plan
We are literally also not talking about that other host
We are talking about my-licences.uk using Cracked stuff
We are talking about their monthly WHMCS Plans as well being fake, And WHMCS agrees
Deleted User - So why does the whmcs site show there licenses as real
Pamar - Jen my whole point was your message "Any valid licence with WHMCS Starts with whmcs-" and I wanted to prove otherwise, yes I know it's off topic but yeah
deleted - Jeekie +rep, they verified a few of my domains ( via who they reseller, them, and a reseller of theirs) ;)
Jen - @Pamar Thats what WHMCS told me
Any Licence with WHMCS- For monthly is a Real licence anything else is fake
deleted - Jen i still have memories of owned-huuriheuhrfurihhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Pamar - Jen oh no! hostgator and some other webhosts are providing fake licenses!!!!
deleted - Pamar yesyesyesy such fake!!!!!!! how dare they!!!!!!!!!!
Jen - @Pamar deleted I'm only agreeing to what WHMCS Staff told me
Its not to cause any other trouble this is only focused at my-licences.uk
deleted - @Jen my point is, they are good, and im locked out of my admin dash another story...
deleted - Jen they're actualy reselling (not gonna give out the provider...)
Jen - deleted Then why is WHMCS found them to be Piracy huh?
You wanna explain the fake licences they are selling at my-licences
deleted - Jen idk and idc, my license showed up as valid and that's the only thing i cared about..
Jen - deleted The reason My-licences are valid and according to whmcs its tricking the system in the algorithm whmcs uses to the one that the my-licences is the same, And there for the system thinks its real, But none of them are in their Databases
deleted - Jen again, they're reselling



Pamar
Jen - deleted Thats totally why WHMCS Marked them as piracy, Cause they are totally selling real stuff
deleted - Jen are u stupid? fr bro?
deleted - i feel like this has to be here - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-09-09/1599675753-36295-image.png
Deleted User - Jen what proof do you have that your whmcs licenses are real?
deleted - Jeekie wait what
Pamar - Jen is selling WHMCS licenses too - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-09-09/1599676073-212363-screenshot-2020-09-09-19-24-21-02.jpeg
Jen - @Jeekie Okay, The Key starts with whmcs-
And it literally is verified with whmcs database
deleted - Pamar A shit!!! 
@Sloth you're free to remove this- they're attacking an competitor for more sales
deleted - Jen yah same is with my-licenses ;)
Jen - deleted No, When I out a my-licences and asked a staff to verify it
They couldn't find it, I'm talking about the pure key
When I asked them about mine they said it was registered through a cPanel partner Liquidnet
deleted - Jen You realise you're doing something wrong as well - - 
You must not sell whmcs as a general product.... :eggsposed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:
Jen - deleted Its not a general product, I literally got it because I asked their support if I am allowed
They said as long as you are doing your re-accruing payments you can
Pamar - Jen Btw, Licenses2host have 2 types of WHMCS license, the internal one which is used in WHMCS installation and the other one in WHMCS database (that how your domain is verified in whmcs verify domain lookup), and You gave internal one to WHMCS support... Of course it won't be in dammit database!
deleted - Pamar nah he stoopit
Jen - Pamar No, I gave them a Actual Licence key from l2h or my-licences.uk And they said it wasn't a thing
deleted - Pamar tbh this is a sales-trashing thread
deleted - Jen mcfreehosting.co.uk kthx
Deleted User - Where did you get the license key from?
Pamar - Jen Which one? Where you got that license?
Deleted User - Anyway I'm out lul I don't like being involved in drama
deleted - What if he did not?
Jen - @Pamar I got it from a my-licences customer, It was directly from it and I gave it to WHMCS Support
I also gave the customers domain that shows its verified
They said it didn't show up as an Actual key or it wasn't suppose to be an authorized domain
deleted - Anyways, if you'd like to, i can talk to his reseller to change prefix to WHMCS-0
Deleted User - Jen wait so just so I understand, your saying that there somehow adding keys to the system without whmcs knowing?
Deleted User - Or domains
Jen - @Jeekie L2h or My-licenecs.uk is using the same Algorithm as WHMCS, There for it shows its authorized
However the Actual key isn't authorized by WHMCS There for it shouldn't show it, But it does because its the same algorithm as WHMCS Keys
deleted - They are using it for automation, pay, get your license,  so you do not have to wait hours....
Pamar - Jen Welp I am not staff of Licenses2host or anything related to Licenses2host, and I would like to get out of this pointless drama. However imo this thread is just for you (as competitor) to take down or give bad reputation to other competitor so you could get more sales, You did not provided any screenshots about the WHMCS support chats (about it wasn't suppose to be an authorized domain or it's not actual key) and I am pretty sure Licenses2host is legit here in WHMCS side, you just incorrectly asked WHMCS for verification (ex. You used the license from Licenses2host which is INTERNAL LICENSE it must be used only in installation). So pointless drama and thread.
deleted - OR DAYS
(talkign abt their reseller)
deleted - Pamar You realise providing screenshots would've voided some WHMCS legal shit
Jen - Pamar That's really not it, I literally told WHMCS my-licences.uk domain as well and they said that wasn't even an authorized domain. What are you talking about.
Jen - https://my-licences.uk
@Pamar This WHMCS on their site is real correct?
Pamar - deleted my mistake.

Jen Authorized domain to use WHMCS or be WHMCS reseller...? (Talking about my-licenses.uk domain)
Jen - Pamar They are not authorized for WHMCS or WHMCS Reseller
There's also no information On L2H or My-licences.uk For them to have any keys registered under their name
Pamar - Jen Alright, my mistake here as I see it's not authorised.
Jen - @Pamar They removed it authorized cause I reported the domain as Piracy
Pamar - Anyway, as I said I am out from this drama - looks pointless.

Jen - deleted Not lying if my WHMCS official ticket says so. :) Nice try for making me look bad tho, We will see what the actual Legal People of WHMCS Say about it
deleted - offer me 1s

deleted - oo btw valid license on mcfh
Jen - deleted My licences are under A Registered cPanel Authorized Seller, And that's what makes them legit, Because they are Verified as a WHMCS Reseller
And They have been around for more years like some place around 1991
But yeah.
deleted - Jen that makes you a competitor, salestrashing
Jen - deleted You can't sales Trash an Business that isn't suppose to be selling it in the first place
On top pirated Versions of Licenses.
deleted - Jen why so many caps + whmcs shows as legit, told you why they are "cracked"
Jen - deleted Because a WHMCS Legal Team Told me it was fake also as well
its coming from a non-bias person that being a WHMCS Staff That has more power over your Opinion

deleted - check out my cover :D
Jen - But that domain has nothing to do with my-licences.uk
Yes they own it but it does not cover the fact that they are using a Pirated WHMCS on my-licences
Jen - Anyways Ima just update this when they come back and tell me when they investigate it more, I'm just saying what they told me
deleted - Jen Yes they own it but it does not cover the fact that they are using a Pirated WHMCS on my-licences
