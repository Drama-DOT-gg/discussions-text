Oliver1234dotdot - Arctic HasX, who worked closely shared more information about the abuse

HasX did NEVER work close to Cyperia.
Oliver1234dotdot - Arctic as well as this Cyperia would remove peoples roles and force them to agree to join the network, but thats another topic

HasX was never a part of Cyperia, he begged a lot but was never accepted and did not own a host.
TheDevil - lol cypheria after all ? scammed? oh gosh that's why rusjs canceled the partner ship deal ðŸ˜…
AceyGoBoom - Oliver1234dotdot he was a staff at oxy i think
Thominek - poggers
Jamie_ - I am like 90% sure plex is just badsk on a new account. Doing the same things, speaks the same, designs logos and websites the same.
AceyGoBoom - Jamie_ then why dont you just ask plexed him self
Arctic - Oliver1234dotdot he was staff on a host
AceyGoBoom - Arctic oh hi arctic
Jamie_ - AceyGoBoom Well obviously he would say he isn't. He has done some dumb shit but I don't think he would be as stupid to admit that.
AceyGoBoom - Jamie_ he sorta said hes badsk
if you just crop out some shit and photoshop it
__SECRET__ - Jamie_ he is badsk but he says "he HaS cHaNgEd AnD iS NoT WhAT hE WaS"
