Prudentia - Is it better to have a theme for your hosting site or have it made custom by a website designer? 
With the price in mind.
samxd - What do you think? Use your brain
Prudentia - samxd Dude this is a discussion, can you not.
samxd - Prudentia It's obvious that Custom is better. You may want to reword this.

Prudentia - samxd Some people can't afford custom, so they use themes. And sometimes themes are the better way to go.
samxd - Prudentia You should have included context in your original statement. Custom is better if you have a more flexible budget. However, if you do have a slightly tighter budget, then yes a theme could work for the time being. Ensure you do research on the theme before purchasing though. You don't want something which is too overused.
