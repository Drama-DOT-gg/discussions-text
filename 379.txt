Chirag - Chirag and I said, "you're being reported" and got banned for "why".
It's a bedrock server...
DeadBush - Chirag the first thing everyone does lmfao. They know that they did illegal stuff so they are scared and banned u. :pepekwek:
DeadBush - @Chirag they are sending that in general chat lmfao - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-04-18/1618743484-381607-image.png

DeadBush - @Chirag i told them they were doing illegal stuff owner says all servers do it and I said hypixel, hive , which server and he says that more than 10 server and when I said then u gonna do sheep walk he banned me XD gotta expose them good and report to discord
DeadBush - and the server is owned by a indian kid so cant expect anything than ban XD
Nomi - DeadBush You see Bot name? I dont think/ it's my own Bot That I Created For Server And I was Testing it -_- also if I did giveawya of Account I should give it right? But I didn't cause that was Test
Nomi - DeadBush :huh: I'm not indian but I think you are xD
DeadBush - Nomi What about the first one
Nomi - DeadBush that was an boost perk that I got from another server so j posted in my booster perks too
FoxyInABoxy - DeadBush lol that is a tutorial server not the main one
DeadBush - Nomi well if some server have the shit dosent mean you do it too. you know its illegal and still you did thats not our fault
DeadBush - One of their owner known of scamming people and leaking other people plugin - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-04-19/1618826799-932155-image.png
Nomi - DeadBush ðŸ¤” Have you seen full video? I dont think Cause you just wanted screen shot also DID YOU READED SERVER NAME AND MY VIDEO TITLE???
DeadBush - Nomi ok i agree it was test server leave that but what about  other stuff the booster perk why would u add that just cuz some other server added it eventhough its illegal? we already shut down a server called rush craft for this things and we expose these kind of servers.
FoxyInABoxy - DeadBush we will look into this problem and try not to do it again!
FoxyInABoxy - DeadBush we cant help that as he says he is improving and will not do it
DeadBush - FoxyInABoxy what about my ban? I was banned for saying the shit you were performing was illegal?
Nomi - HMMMM WHAT IS DRAMA.GG
DeadBush - Nomi its a place to expose illgeal shits
Nomi - DeadBush OH

joppari - well what i can say is that they dont like fair competition. DDoSing, Nuking , raiding , advertising (on our server) , using  hacked clients , scamming is their specialty. I was not aware of this server until 3 days ago when my server got under DDoS attack . Thanks to my reliable info source i have confirmed they not only break Discord TOS they steal peoples work . Their current website is CosmicPVP s website which their owner claims he himself coded ( which surely not he just downloaded the source file and modified). Also tried to copy our servers website and failed. Has hypixel map , claims that they are hypixel server , which surely is against hypixel copyright. What i want to tell is if anyone seeing this thread i would recommend stay away from them as they can be quite dangerous (in terms of copying , and the dirty low tricks). If any server which has experienced such event is here i would recommend contacting me.
AbisGamer - DeadBush Worst part is, that lobby is from a paid setup and it got leak3d. They don't have any rights to use it.
AbisGamer - Their server is really buggy and poorly Developed. They got a big youtuber to review their server, I don't know if they paid and hoe much they did. Then I made a video about how buggy their server was and I was banned while I was making the video. After that his people have been trying to raid my discord server and keep spamming in comments of the video I made. I will be making more videos as this server is a scam and who knows what they will do with the playerdata they got from the people that joined due to the youtuber's video. The video I made is here - https://youtube.com/pogmc
DeadBushMC - AbisGamer well cant say much. Pogmc didnt do illegal shit yea pogmc is laggy but that's not the point. Point is nomi did some serious illegal shit for which he can be jailed if did FIR by jop. The kids that are supporting on both sides (Im saying the toxic ones) are 95%Indians i can say that confidential cuz of personal experience in both of the server and personal experience with indian people irl. Im not saying all but those 9-15 age group indian kids most of them are really toxic you can say that just by looking at how toxic Indian gaming community is. Again, Not hating on anyone everything is based on my opinion and personal experience.

Now lets come to fact:
Nomi cracked illegal accounts, Token logger, DDosing, Griefing, Nuking other competitions which he can be jailed for like 10 years and fined in 100 thousands if joppari actually wants. He used to give nitro and acc gen with Token logger in it. Does a lot of shit but he still doesn't have a paid domain for his server uses uk.to which is made from a Subdomain maker. and a lot of crap which joppari will explain
Nomi - oh
RealBJsingh - The dumpest thing is that he agreed that he ddosed  in a message and that's the best proof 
Will really suggest you to stop doing this crappy stuff or you know the consequences
AbisGamer - Took me fricking 1 hour to make this. Maybe its just because I code pogmc website myself and not cough steal it cough https://pogmc.net/dreammc/
DeadBushMC - RealBJsingh ye he can be jailed lmao

joppari - According to FoxyinBoxy when he was working in DreamMC the current owner Nomi never actually did anything for the developmental aspect. FoxyinBoxy developed the server alone just to be betrayed and kicked out of the server. The reason of their bugs is predicted that there is no one to maintain the server anymore since thier owner kicked the only one who was capable of maintain their server. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-06/1625557645-659626-image.png

joppari - i think i dont need to explain this (literally admitted to ddosing yet acting innocent) - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-06/1625558304-35141-image.png
joppari - e
he even tried to make a fight between friends to get out of water dry (meow is friend of mine who helped me on antiddos stuff) - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-06/1625558382-418567-image.png

joppari - RealBJsingh that screenshot is already sent at the first of the photos
DeadBush - he got exposed soo bad
@joppari if i wanted i can just ddos their server and use stresses and kill their server for months really easily. I know almost all loopholes in pmmp and geyser and make him taste his own sin. but yk I ain't like that. If i do the same what's difference in me and nomi lol.
DeadBush - well if you still see kids tryna vouch for Nomi even after seeing the confirmed tag then yk
90% of them are 9-15 age group Indian kids (not hating on Indians again it's just mostly kids are really toxic and I have seen their chat it's in Hindi and toxic asf). Thanks
CoreDaDev - Also Nomi pays big youtubers So he can make his position from above cc he cant spend more than 100$ to take down cc bcz he knows that CC is way far from his server, Alos "DreamMc" has no pvp area its a downloaded they copied hypixels hub "Downloaded" all of their plugins are from poggit and are stealen and their server can take upto an hour to make but because of foxys plugins "that he stole" making his server go better. he isnt releasing a next season as he said it in his discord bcz he cant code new plugins for his server as foxy has gone no one is there to code for him joppari @RealBJsingh - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-06/1625560127-462225-screenshot-2.png
neo - dont believe nomi he alredy nuked my server 5times who have 500 memeber and 32 boost and say we are friends but realtiy is he want dreammc is best skyblock server in whole world but cosmocraft is better than so he was doing ddos if u want more info about nomi dm me i will give all deltail about nomi
CoreDaDev - neo pls give all details abt nomi and give ss here
Sloth - @Sapro please do not condone DDoS attacks, as they are not just going to be hurting whatever organisation you'd attack, but the network behind it as well, and might cause other customers of the upstream provider who share the connection to be cut off. DDoS attacks are also quite illegal, and if anything is done about it afterwards, which rarely happens, it would make you liable. Don't DDoS, stay in school.
RealBJsingh - We can't be stupid for stupid people then what will be the difference between them and us. He ddosed and and now he will face the consequences. Ddosing them back will make us same as them and we aren't going to do that.
Sapro - Sloth  I said I will I not siad that I am gonna do ddos attack
FoxyInABoxy - RealBJsingh agreed, anyways im foxy
Sapro - Sloth also let me tell you that I completed school that you telling me to stay in school
srybruh - joppari bruuh your sever op but all they are some hater
srybruh - joppari I support cosmocraft
RealBJsingh - srybruh Who and what are u bruh
Momin - @joppari Cosmocraft op that they took action on nomi he hacked my friends server many times tried to hack mine but got banned and he is a liar he told me that he didn't hacked any server and the audit log full of saying nomi hacking ðŸ˜‚ i even have the server where he showed me his nuke bot
srybruh - RealBJsingh I am zippy I I think Nomi is good but now I know he very bad he nuke discord sever
Momin - srybruh TRUE HOW DARE HE DDOS ATTACK COSMOCRAFT WHERE OUR ALL FRIENDE LIKE U PRADEEP BJ JOPPARI FRIENDSHIP STARTED (IK WE DID SOME FIGHTS BETWEEN BUT IK WE R STILL FRIENDS IN HEART)  WE WANT TO TALE ACTION BUT NOT OF STUPID LIKE TO DDOS HIM WE R NOT STUPID OR WE WILL BE SAME AS HIM
Momin - srybruh I was not his friend before i was with foxy buthe tried to nuke WestroCraft but he got banned and then u took me to a server where we finished fights with everyone and become friends and then i left foxy and then foxy thought im nomi friend and other ppl to but i was not with him i was trying to nuke but i was wrong i didn't or i be stupid like him i was waiting for this to happen from weeks and this now happened
LakshyaWalia - DeadBush u know what discord trust and safety exists
LakshyaWalia - @Nomi tbh this wont make your server on top or increase your rep as if a guy in playing on a server will still keep playing until he gets bored of it even if he/she finds a better server as they have spent time and see it get changes
u can see the example of we all know HYPIXEL they got DDOS attacked and were down for  few days or around a week but after 1-2 days of coming back it had full on player base back to normal so downtime and criticization doesn't matter exactly
the thing that only matter is dedication and hard ship
if u have dedication and feeling of living together and not criticizing others u will be successful for sure
u can also see their are alot of shops in market so should one of the guys burn other's shops?
@FoxyInABoxy what u think?
pradeep - RealBJsingh ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£lol
pradeep - guys I think now he will try to nuke more server so be safe
pradeep - Momin yea
DeadBush - Why do I feel like the new server owner is his alt lmao - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-06/1625573307-274438-screenshot-2021-07-06-17-34-30-788-comdiscord.jpg
DeadBush - He says that the Sami is his alt he gave to guy called sami and he uses it but 100% it's Nomi himself playing along. And he names himself Nomi Come Back lmao he is tryna play with people's emotional to gain sympathy and support from brainwashed people - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-06/1625573446-668076-screenshot-2021-07-06-17-39-37-354-comdiscord.jpg
srybruh - DeadBush No he will never leave
pradeep - congratulations guys now leave but i think that his second because he can leave dream mc easily
pradeep - DeadBush no one can leave own server like this me also thinking his second account
DeadBush - srybruh that's what I mean that's all his alts
DeadBush - My alt got banned for sending drama.gg thread lol
joppari - Even after all the expositions and findings he seems to be still insisting to not take responsibility. He made it so it looks like he sold the server to someone else and left himself . In reality its just an act which is to be expected from this kind of person. Below is the proofs that this "Sami" is indeed his alt.
He still running away from responsibility  which confirming how fraudulent he is. Nomi you should take responsibility and properly apologize the servers you have troubled and more importantly you should give FoxyinBoxy his server back. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-06/1625576425-248441-screenshot-20210706-215510.jpg

FoxyInABoxy - LakshyaWalia agreed!
Sapro - DeadBush yeah there name is also like same 100% it's his alt
Sapro - Everyone be careful if it was nomi alt then many skyblock servers are in danger
joppari - he doesnt poses any "danger" at all . What i concerned about is the fact that he is faking everything and not even feeling guilt . He never even showed a sign of regret not to mention even admitted to me that he was ddosing my server. (as you saw from the pictures from above i had to take that info from foxyinboxy)
Sapro - I not mean that I said to be careful by his nukes nd ddos attacks
Momin - LakshyaWalia Maybe if he have ddos attack hypixel ðŸ˜…
FoxyInABoxy - DeadBush the highest role on dreammc was on nomi's main, duh

CoreDaDev - FoxyInABoxy  ye ik that idiot. it was his alt i knew it.
Nomi - CoreDaDev lmfao ofc its me any problem kiddu?
srybruh - Nomi scammer bitch fuck u mf
joppari - he thinks just closing down his server(purely an act) and acting like he is the victim can save himself. No, until you properly apologize to the people you have troubled they won't stop. All this hatred and anger is because of you and your action only. I would suggest you come forward and properly apologize to those who you have troubled. Joining our discord on alt and spamming won't get you anywhere. Stop DMing me i won't be talking with you anymore until you apologize to everyone who you have troubled.
Nomi - joppari huh apologize? never lmao
pradeep - Nomi shut up noob uncle

Kowone - DeadBush i'll watch this later
FoxyInABoxy - DeadBush so, on this situation.... i must say this aint something "new" as this son of a bitch better known as "nomi" has been trying to ruin my reputation ever since he kicked me out... in the recent days hes been creating discord alt account and trying to gain staff roles on my server which in future he would use to nuke the same. hes been ddosing server i work with, servers supporting me, and also... hes been stealing credits for my work (this was mentioned in the thread before). well all i would like to say is utilize the discord "block" function and ignore these nerds

PS: this aint ending soon... nomi would still try to continue these things and btw these attacks on my server have taken place in the same week. the date is 8/21/2021 for me!
DeadBush - FoxyInABoxy im just waiting for him to directly attack me so I can get that nerd into legal action
p.s: Im 18 and my maternal uncle is a Lawyer
