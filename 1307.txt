UnseenAcoustics - Hey, I found a host called Half Nodes, and I've been looking for the ToS and PP but haven't been able to find them, and they have a panel and dashboard that are hosted on Linode.



I suppose they are going to have free VPS?!


And they have to make an account for us on the panel, because they have no idea how to link the dashboard to the panel.

Ples - he didnt have any rules and he banned me smh false ban - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-18/1639862330-832447-image.png
TheAlex - Lemme check it, don't raid them yet
TheAlex - It looks ok now, they have ToS and Privacy olicy and said they will provide proof of purchase tomorrow since it is pretty late rn. 
They seem like ok people, just a new host but not skids
UnknownTheBestGamer - co-owner here I'm just here to say no 100$ free credit I buy my servers on Linode and I have deleted the host due to the fact that the second owner did this (he is 14) and I also deleted the discord server Dash wasn't ready and we didn't have nodes for free plans 
THIS HOST WAs IN PRE ALPHA everyone who created a ticket to buy a server we literally told them it isn't ready and we got listed here because we wanted to make a fucking host?

EDIT: merged posts
and you making fun of me really isn't funny we were creating accs because dash wasn't ready I forgot to say that registering on our Controlpanel-gg dashboard auto-creates an ACC there I am the only dev in this host setting up servers for an Indian 14 y/o kid who paid me to do it so fuck off I guess

EDIT: merged posts
I forgot to mention that the "Free" VPS runs on ADs and in-browser crypto mining on the WIP afk page 
edit: every time I try to start my own business someone on this stupid fucking website has to ruin it
UnknownTheBestGamer - Ples u were not banned the server was deleted
Ples - UnknownTheBestGamer i was banned the server was up 18 hours ago but it seems to be recently deleted, so no i was banned.
UnknownTheBestGamer - Ples I'm not a liar you weren't fucking banned lol unless the other "owner" did it
MrTechy - UnknownTheBestGamer No one said you lied, maybe a misunderstanding.
UnknownTheBestGamer - MrTechy yeah i should calm down because the host is fucking gone anyways lol
