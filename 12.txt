Deleted User - I think I remember Cole at some point, but I don't remember where.. Like, I remembered him like I have ever talked to him before..
Robert - StarLightz I believe he scammed DeeDoctor or someone similar, I am not too sure tho. I also remember Cole from somewhere else, but I can't remember where.
Deleted User - Robert Hey, now I remember when you mentioned Dee.
SomeRandomPleb - To be fair, you really shouldn't have fallen for that. It was very much an obvious scam.
candy - Wow! This thread is really dead.
CursedHoliday - Yes it is
RumGuru - So you all probably know james.
He raided rolled host and he stole their client theme.
thread about him stealing - "https://drama.gg/d/273-villagenodes-stealing-and-abuse"
He owned many hosts and they always die, either he "rebrands" or he wipes nodes and start again.
He started a new host "waffle host" kinda stupid name tbh but ok
A day ago i opened ticket i wanted to apply for staff and he immediately said "hell nah" and closed ticket, i opened ticket and asked whats problem he closed it again.
And couple minutes ago we were fighting in drama.gg discord and i just randomly see waffle host discord disappear.
He banned me for no reason lmao.
"James" had many names and accounts before this one.
Here are some that i remember : "james/leo/shonfli/candy/dhiro and many more that i dont remember."
I made this thread so you all would know his past and his bad behaviour, i suggest you to not use waffle host because he is owner on it, but you guys decide if you are gonna do it or no.

Waffle Host discord: https://discord.gg/a5j2hwgZ
DHiro - I don't see any proof
RumGuru - DHiro Go visit other thread, also im gonna send screenshot that im banned from waffle host
RumGuru -  - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-26/1622041855-341567-snimka-zaslona-568.png
DHiro - Why can't I ban you?
Hmm, that one is pretty much resolved as I don't own NeoCloud.
The theme issue was resolved by me and daft. Ask him if you want ig
doze - this is false
doze - He can fix himself
doze - James did nothing
RumGuru - DHiro You can but thats called "bad service", because you banned for no reason
About theme idc if its resolved you steal stole it.
And you owned lot of hosts lime 5 or more idk
RumGuru - doze You are his alt probably?
_MrKnight_ - RumGuru first the client thingy, we don't use it , we use client made by eisk which he custom build for me in the past and later we upgraded it . second i also works as same level manager of james so i dont see a point on all the host he made "dies". 3rd waffle dint even launched . 4th we where looking for operators or operations or whatever it is called , we dint wanted any staffs as we already have 18+ staffs
doze - and if he does quit in this host, I am gonna hold it since I have nodes with me so there is no problem with that.
doze - So I don't get the reason why this thread is made.
RumGuru - _MrKnight_ This thread  is mostly about james, but i just wanted to alert people about james bad past and stuff he did
_MrKnight_ - and last he have rights to ban anyone who spread hatred and miss leading info's
RumGuru - _MrKnight_ I never said anthying in waffle host.
So he banned me for no reason
RumGuru - doze Are you james alt or who lol?
DHiro - RumGuru it's my choice to ban anyone I want
DHiro - RumGuru he is not
RumGuru - DHiro it is but like i said banning for no reason is "bad service"
_MrKnight_ - RumGuru That's thomas
_MrKnight_ - RumGuru I said we dint launched
DHiro - RumGuru WE PINGED YOU SEVERAL TIMES That STAF APPLICATON IS NOT OPEN.
AND CLOSED THE TICKET..
also I decide to change my name or not
RumGuru - _MrKnight_ its still bad service banning someone for no reason lmao
_MrKnight_ - Our host isn't up then how u talk about services ,
DHiro - _MrKnight_ he is talking about the past
doze - Yeah I did by mistake Sorry.
_MrKnight_ - RumGuru The reason is u tried to ruin rep of the ceo of waffle
DHiro - Never really raided them lmao
RumGuru - DHiro You changed your names/accounts  because you were scared that people will haet you because of your past.
You didnt ping me you just said "hell nah" and closed ticket lmao
_MrKnight_ - DHiro Lol If I am sure the past was fixed
doze - And our host didn't even release lmao
RumGuru - _MrKnight_ He ruined his own rep by his actions, im just showing people what he did
doze - Its because we don't need staff we just need Operations.
_MrKnight_ - RumGuru No lol he just wanted to be professional so he added his irl name in dc
RumGuru - doze  i applied for that
_MrKnight_ - RumGuru The "past" was fixed
RumGuru - _MrKnight_ What about his past names/accounts lmao
"leo/shonfli/candy/dhiro and many more that i dont remember."
doze - _MrKnight_ Yeah.
DHiro - RumGuru You clearly said can I apply for staff. And we said no. Because we didn't wanted you.
DHiro - RumGuru All nicknames Minecraft names and stuff.
Please post a proof
_MrKnight_ - Anyway I don't see a good point here , the only thing I see is you are just mad at james for not hiring u so yeah bye. We dint launced our host so don't talk about services before it's even started
doze - RumGuru I think he closed it by mistake as I also applied for operations and in dms i said i want to be operations but he said nah so when i opened a ticket he misunderstood your ticket as mine and closed it.
RumGuru - _MrKnight_ Every time he opens host it fails, so i want people to know that.
And tbh i think same is gonna happen to waffle host
doze - RumGuru Nah, If he gives up i am gonna be the owner since I own nodes and domains for waffle.
_MrKnight_ - RumGuru It won't close, even if james leaves we have thomas , eisk , grizzly etc
RumGuru - DHiro i first said that i want to apply for staff, then some guy said that i can only apply for operations and i said "sure", then you came and said "hell nah" and closed my ticket
doze - doze let me show evidence
DHiro - RumGuru I only opened a hosting once.
And that was VillageNodes it was rebranded to cubemc then sold.
I joined duohosr which is dafts
And atomhosr which NGXs

So it didn't really fail
RumGuru - DHiro Proof of what?
_MrKnight_ - doze True
DHiro - RumGuru raiding etc.

Anyways I'm gonna head off to sleep.
_MrKnight_ - Rum, working for a host don't mean that u owns it buddy , understand the difference of owns and works
RumGuru - _MrKnight_ Lol if i was mad for that i wouldve made this thread yesterday, im mad because james started insulting me in drama.gg discord
RumGuru - doze lmao he didnt he said "hell nag"
_MrKnight_ - James owned only village nodes
RumGuru - RumGuru "hell nah"
sorry for mistake
RumGuru - _MrKnight_ what if james decides to delete discord or wipe nodes?
what are you gonna do then lmao
_MrKnight_ - RumGuru Idk about the dc , if you have issues with james talk to him , we also works for wafflehost all day so don't be a pain for us because we are not interested in a war or wasting our time
DHiro - RumGuru and once again our fellow rumtunturu is being destroyed
DHiro - RumGuru I would never.
I NEVER WIPED NODES WITHOUT A WARNING BEFORE.
doze - _MrKnight_ Yeah.
_MrKnight_ - RumGuru First we have panel access to nodes second I'm registering waffle soon in india third he won't delete dc
RumGuru - DHiro Rebrand usually means to just change name and domain
but your rebrand means "wiping nodes, changing discord"
You were owner of it - duohost
AtomHost- i never saw ngxs talk and yo had ownership of discord
_MrKnight_ - DHiro Pls be professional, we came to solve not to create a fight
doze - RumGuru NGX owns the domain.
RumGuru - _MrKnight_ if waffle is owned by james its  automatically bad
_MrKnight_ - Gtg I need to go now as I need to wake early morning so yeah bye for now
RumGuru - DHiro You always warned and gave them like 24 hours but you didnt just wipe nodes once in village nodes you did it multiple times lol
RumGuru - DHiro nop its going great
doze - RumGuru How?  We have no overallocation and we are not using a stolen theme/panel,
RumGuru - _MrKnight_ Lol james always said that he will register his companys but he never did because he knew they would fail
RumGuru - _MrKnight_ Imagine asking james to be proffesional
DHiro - I only wiped once.
You started more hosting than me
Raised host
Spark nodes
Valence
RumGuru - doze im saying about his previous hosts
doze - DHiro Tottaly right ✅
doze - I was using RaidedHost for just hosting my test bot and after few days boom it became Spark Nodes
doze - RumGuru Oh okay, alr but he changed him self.
RumGuru - DHiro You wiped multiple times!
I only owned one host
Raided host was rebranded to sparknodes
And no nodes were wiped, only domain and website changed.
And i had to change because tomas was owner of raidedhost.com domain
And valence never opened and it wont open soon
doze - DHiro *RaidedHost
RumGuru - doze Ye domain changed, and you never used my hosts, i dont remember you but ok lol
DHiro - RumGuru never did multiple names 😉
doze - RumGuru what when did i own raidedhost.com :BRUH:
doze - RumGuru ScriptedEvil
RumGuru - DHiro You did wipe it multiple times like 2-3  or more im not sure
doze - RumGuru Um when i checked panel my free bot hosting was gone.
RumGuru - doze im talking about other tomas not you
And i dont even know that you are tomas
DHiro - RumGuru Nah I'm sure I didnt do more than once
doze - RumGuru I am Thomas S.#0001/ScriptedEvil#0001/トーマスS。#0001.
RumGuru - doze liar i  just changed domain, and after 2 weeks i closed host and i gave people like a week to backup their servers, but no one did because no one even used host, people just created servers but they never actually uploaded any files
RumGuru - doze im talking about other tomas bruh
RumGuru - DHiro Im sure you did it 2+ times
DHiro - RumGuru give me proof kthx
doze - RumGuru anyway was a long time ago I probably forgot or something.
RumGuru - DHiro how can i find proof if discord is deleted lmao
DHiro - RumGuru It still exists. Just got raided 3 times and it's dead
honk - RumGuru DHiro wasn't the owner of DuoHost. Daft was the owner.
RumGuru - honk he was
RusJS - RumGuru DHiro was never involved into the team with DuoHost. Only Daft, The MG and his other friend that was donating a node was
RumGuru - RusJS he had owner role and he was announcing stuff bruh
honk - RumGuru No he wasn't I was executive in it lmao, Daft owned the Discord, domains etc.
RumGuru - honk 
Bruh see he was owner - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-26/1622049674-308969-screenshot-20210526-192027-discord.jpg
Daftscientist - honk DHiro owned the nodes, mythicalkitten owned the gp vps, i owned the domain and the discord and was a bit inactive lmfaso.
Daftscientist - we had blesta not whmcs.... and i own duohost domain so idk.
Daftscientist - nvm, wrong pic - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-26/1622051164-927962-image.png
RumGuru - Daftscientist finnaly @honk see bruh 
Also daft this thread is not connected to you in any way lol
Daftscientist - i can conferm DHiro owned duohost, i owned the domain and discord. but he managed it and dealt with winterhoax and owned the nodes, duohost used HIS paypal. i got no profits from it. DHiro took the money.
Daftscientist - RumGuru it better not be :/
honk - Daftscientist ye don't worry lmao
Daftscientist - WAIT JAMES IS DHiro????????
AlphaDarky - Daftscientist yes dumbo
Daftscientist - o, 
"He raided rolled host and he stole their client theme." - was fixed.
DHiro - Hello, I am james.
I apologize on my actions and I hope any of those stuff never happen again.
I'm just here to point out that.
"He raided rolled host and he stole their client theme." - was resolved by Daftscientist and me(james)
"He owned many hosts and they always die, either he "rebrands" or he wipes nodes and start again." -
I only owned one which was named VillageNodes, and the name just didn't fit our branding so we had to change the name to cubemc.host which is Daft's domain (He isn't involved in any of these.) also, VillageNodes.host domain was owned by a guy named GrimS.

I have worked on DuoHost as Management Team(Owner) for amount of time, I was too stressed so I just left, and Daftscientist decided to close down DuoHost.

So you heard about NeoCloud, I never worked on those, I asked for Aces to remove my role so many times. So probably some of you guys may think I owned it.

Hirocloud was owned by me, but before opening I decided to change the name to AtomHost for better branding, since HiroCloud didn't really fit on anything. After changing to AtomHost, it was fully owned by NGX and I was just a management.

I wiped the nodes by giving people a time to backup, and offering a backup to people who asked for their backups in tickets after wiping. I gave 24 hours of time, since I had no more funds to maintain the nodes.

"A day ago i opened ticket i wanted to apply for staff and he immediately said "hell nah" and closed ticket, i opened ticket and asked whats problem he closed it again." - We told you that we currently are not in need of staff members since we had over 16. Then closed the ticket.
You opened again, The reason why I said "hell nah" is because I have worked with you before, I know how much experience you have and how you work. so I just didn't want you work in WaffleHost.

"And couple minutes ago we were fighting in drama.gg discord and i just randomly see waffle host discord disappear.
He banned me for no reason lmao." - I have full rights to ban you, There is no need to be reason If i just wanted to ban you.

""James" had many names and accounts before this one.
Here are some that i remember : "james/leo/shonfli/candy/dhiro and many more that i dont remember.""
I just feel like changing name. candy was never my name, My name was D'Hiro for some joking purposes. and Shonfli is my minecraft username, Leo Boldoo is my nickname which people calls me for some reason, and James is my real name.

"i can conferm DHiro owned duohost, i owned the domain and discord. but he managed it and dealt with winterhoax and owned the nodes, duohost used HIS paypal. i got no profits from it. DHiro took the money." 
I didn't owned DuoHost, you did. I just paid for the nodes. and it used my PayPal because no one had any other way to store the money, If you wanted to use your paypal you could just ask for it. I took the money that I have invested into DuoHost, Total of 14$ one for 10$ on a node that I was owning and another one for 4$ on a node that I was owning too. and the 2 customers we're my friends, I refunded them.

Again, I'm sorry RumGuru.
I hope this won't happen again.
DHiro - RumGuru ^^ Explained above.
since WHMCS was too expensive, and we already had Blesta we just continued with Blesta, since it was easier to use and cleaner in my opinion.
DHiro - RumGuru 
"he had owner role and he was announcing stuff bruh" - I was management, so I would have to lol
RumGuru - DHiro ok some of these are still false but ok idc
@Jedrik you can mark this as resolved if you want
mtt - Apparently he is now a confirmed Pedophile...
He started flirting and asking Nova (whom is 15) for explicit pictures and started flirting. 
He has confirmed he's 18 before.
Tf...
_MrKnight_ - true
Nova - My past experience with James hasn't been so good, this is my first drama.gg thread so excuse me if it isn't perfect.
