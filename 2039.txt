"Not even a registered company"

Being registered is a plus but not a necessary, also apart from a service being set up i dont see anything wrong with them, provide proof of bad customer support or them not owning hardware please
MicroBot - SolaX Looks to me that there is an SSL. - https://cdn.upload.systems/uploads/BnQCUDfo.png
DeplexHost - This is him also asking for someone to ddos my site. Highly illegal. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-09-12/1662959349-647956-chrome-d5qbpuv3gm.png

Indeed - he could be legit paying for GCP but i highly doubt it GCP is just too expensive especially for a startup host like this
DeplexHost - Also here is some more crap on him when he was poaching customers. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-09-12/1662968347-281770-discord-prytfbm7ty.png

Leon - SolaX Just by looking at their website, they have no mention on any Privacy Policy, Terms of Service not to mention that the website only has two pages in total. Seems too sketchy for me even if the SSL certificate was valid.
AlexWebzz - SolaX Claiming they own the hardware when they only resell.

It's not an illegal activity or unprofessional, almost every company that provides hosting (in my experience) - doesn't actually own hardware, they only rent it at Hetzner, OVH and etc. But I've noticed that they don't have ToS, nor Privacy Policy, now this is truly unprofessional (And, maybe illegal, because we don't know how they use our data.)
