Ricardo - So today, i was on disboard, when i found a free host operating on a freenom domain!
So, well i found out that the uptime is really low!


And now what? Also they don't have any legal information!

And for a final touch, they don't want you to know what hosting they're reselling (Prob using free credits)

But, i finally get their node ip - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-04-21/1619014172-229270-33859.png

Ricardo - OH! Did i say that the logo is robbed? - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-04-21/1619016290-374695-33895.png
Well - Did you look at member count?
Slayer - All "free hostings" under the Freenom domain are interesting. Probably the worst ones lmao
Deleted User - Lol I own my  own host and I use a cf domain so what‚Äôs the problem
Iceey - GavinFontaine A few things...
Slayer - GavinFontaine Just buy a domain if you have enough money for servers. It's that easy
mtt - GavinFontaine If you have enough to pay servers you HAVE to have just $5 or $10 for a simple domain...
Deleted User - Slayer Where even?
Ricardo - Slayer well, looking they use vultr free credits...
mtt - GavinFontaine namecheap, 123reg, namesilo, porkbun, etc... There's a lot of registrars if what's what you mean
Ricardo - mtt xyz 1,20 ‚Ç¨ xd
mtt - Ricardo at least a .xyz domain but free domains are the worst
ItsYaBoyBanana - also the name isn't very original... there is another host called nexusnode https://nexusnode.com/
Deleted User - And?
Deleted User - Who the hell cares? You starting drama
Well - We didnt knew that üòî
mtt - GavinFontaine Welcome to drama.gg buddy
Well - GavinFontaine thats whole point of this forum. This is dumb honestly tbh
Willypro7 - First, downtime is something we already know, and in that I agree. Freenom's domain is because right now we don't have much money for normal domains. I don't take care of that. We made legal information, it is in # üìú‚îÉtos. We also have # üìú‚îÉprivacy-policy. So don't lie. We do not give the url of the node since we mostly host Discord bots, and you don't need the url at all. If you need it, we give it to you, but we do not give it by default.
I give you reason about downtime, but drama.gg post for that ... @Ricardo
Tomas - who the fuck buys a dedi from Contabo, you sure it isn't just a VPS?
mtt - This is literally the shittiest host ever. 
This kid Cloudbud started arguing in VC and defending free domains because he's a cheapass trying to run a host.
Now they started saying they do not care about a .tk domain or having a TOS/Privacy Policy while holding data already.
They're trying to sound cool while not even knowing what they're doing...
Well - Get a life and stop causing drama
mtt - Well So cry about it dude, your company is illegal + if we're not talking about legal documents look at your shitty nodes and uptime.
RusJS - you guys are running illegally and espically banned me after me mentioning the tos and privacy policy + giving you some advice/tips on it.. also your terms of service is so invalid, you dont even need a lawyer to check it because its already that bad (tos is for a THEME Site not a hosting "company" also check this out "These Terms of Service has been created with the help of the Terms Of Service and the Privacy Policy." LOL)
Well - mtt i am not even crying i think its funny that someone would waste their time to complain to a host. You could just gave them feedback but no some shitty person without a life wanted to ruined everything.
Well - RusJS You just said hahaha this host bad doesnt have tos and privacy policy you could just said Can you make ToS/Privacy policy so people would know how the host works etc.
mtt - Well We were literally pointing you don't have legal documents and using a .tk domain... YET, you guys started saying some nonsense and defending all of what we pointed out in an absurd way.
Tomas - Well yeah but you're operating illegally lol
Iceey - I charge $20-50/document.
FatGrizzly - Well dude, this thread is not made to kill you or your host, btw if you correct all your mistakes you can get the thread locked.. so yeah, just do a search on freenom domains in drama.gg(I'm lazy to provide links)
mtt - Iceey 
^
If you guys get an (Iceey) legal document and a domain we will leave you alone LMAO
RusJS - Well hold on a frucki second i never said any of that i said it wouldve been a little bit more decent if you had privacy policy so people would know what they are registering to... also thats not how tos/privacy policy works "just said Can you make ToS/Privacy policy so people would know how the host works etc." what the hell do you mean, "so people would know how to the host would work" NO thats so wrong lol also you are just swearing at your clients so thats even more unfortunate for you later on
Well - RusJS i didnt even swear. i just watched the whole dumb arguement while eating popcorn
FatGrizzly - Well Hmmm
Mea - using frenom domain is not a good thing 2 do. people will think that u dont have money to pay for nodes etc and will just leave the host because if you cant afford legal documents and even .xyz domain then why u run the host its useless.
_Player1 - Dang, If we are gonna complain about a Hosts can we all come to my host? I use a Tk Domain, But i have good uptime and we are working on the Legal Documents at the Moment, If there is anything else we are Missing Please State in my DMs for my Hosting (This is my Friends of Friends Hosting Company thats why im posting here) My Hosting: [Redacted - @Jedrik]
Mea - advertising is not good thing 2 do tho
Iceey - _Player1 When's your kindergarten graduation?
Tomas - GavinFontaine bro r u rectrox
Mea - GavinFontaine ur probs getting banned for saying it
Deleted User - Iceey your a dumb
mtt - _Player1 Bruh, you literally want to advertise your host so bad don't you. Get out of here my  dude
Deleted User - Mea  i will ban you from America
Jedrik - _Player1 no ‚ù§Ô∏è
mtt - GavinFontaine Iceey has probably 50X your amount of braincells. You're in like 5th grade and think free domains are cool and you're proud from using them. You can't be the one talking here
Deleted User - You guys are all 5 and starting drama
mtt - GavinFontaine Look who's talking, and read the website dude.
Mea - GavinFontaine its not drama lmao
Mea - GavinFontaine and yes read the website name "drama.gg"
Chirag - GavinFontaine

"Drama is an undeniable fuel of life."
Deleted User - Mea aww you gonna expose my host aww little 5 year old
Mea - GavinFontaine im not mirror ok. i bet nexusnodes will close now because this kid cant handle it
mtt - GavinFontaine It's not even "drama". It's exposing businesses illegal practices and bad habits. Grow up and take responsibility of your scummy actions dude...
mtt - GavinFontaine My guy you don't even know what you're talking about...
Have 1-2 business and law classes and you will expand your knowledge a bit more üòâ
