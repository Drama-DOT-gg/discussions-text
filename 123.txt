Tomas - Hello everyone.
The owner of relabs.host has done some bad stuff in the past regarding nulled software, but he's still at it basically, also this thread is a joke and is mostly fake, he just wanted to be winterhoaxed.
Here's just some of the few things:
Nulled WHMCS on Domains





Check them yourselfs, but this is what the verification systems have told me.

He's admitted to being only NINE years old multiple times, he seems quite needy and is basically a child.

He has also nulled WHMautopilot, in which the evidence is;


His TOS/Privacy Policy was just stolen from CloudianOS.

He's also been caught with others attempting to DDOS people; see here

He's also done this stuff in the past, on previous sites. See; here

Korudo - Also that "evidence" is not proof at all I can say I have nulled fences (paid software) but doesn't mean its true
Korudo - That other DDoS post was resolved and he is already confirmed
Korudo - So this is pointless
Tomas - Korudo Yes, yes it is.
mxnugget - it's not nulled - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-10-14/1602651476-540223-screenshot-20201014-075726-chrome.jpeg
