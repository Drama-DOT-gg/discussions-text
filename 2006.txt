Hyperz - TL;DR
Hosting company looks at your private VPS files without your permission / logs onto your server, publicly streams and releases address's and emails in public voice channels, uses pirated / NULLED software (stolen WHMCS license), claims to do none of it, however their is gallons of proof that clearly show them committing these actions, and even more showing them trying to play cover up and sweep it under the rug.

J&amp;M Hosting was launched by Jordan &amp; Matthew Maddox

Matt: (originally worked for Host Nexxus)
Matthew Maddox (Founder, COO) - Fake cop, professional faker and overall scumbag. Previous Host Nexxus support manager and known to share clients info over screen shares, stream himself logging into clients servers without consent

Jordan (Founder) - Pretty cool guy, don't know much about him.

Cayden (CEO) - Has been unaware of what Matt has been up to behind the scenes.



J&amp;M Hosting is a demon-hell spawn destined to end in a fiery ball of shit and piss. It's a complete joke, owners cannot be trusted and all priorities are FUCKED. Its fucking terrible, for the love of god please move your services off of there before you get your database leaked TOO.

An owner "Matt" has been found publicly releasing customer address's live on stream in multiple places, he has also shown himself viewing the virtual servers of his clients WITHOUT THEIR PERMISSION and touching / taking the files on said servers. While he is doing this, he is more focused on his radio station XX.X The Shitty Hosting Provider or whatever it's called... Meanwhile he manages to leak ALL OF HIS DIRECT ADMIN INFORMATION.



After being accused of not owning a license to WHMCS, which is clearly shown here:
 

He then decides to "show proof he owns a license" and posts this image to the announcements channel:
 
(full chat screenshot)

Which is NOT PROOF that he owns a license to WHMCS (because he didn't), it's just proof that he pays for DirectAdmin. While in the mean time he IS using a NULLED copy of WHMCS. Of-course, after that being said, and the word spreading, they decided to go ahead and buy that license to their pirated software.

So, they bought a license to it:


Overall this company is now trying to play cover-up after being publicly exposed and losing multiple partners and affiliates from using stolen and NULLED software and violating so many of it's clients. - https://cdn.hyperz.net/u/main/ZJvYYm8.png

EvanM - thats fucked up!
EvanM - Holy moly ðŸ¤£
RealHD - Yes we had a issue with the verification of the WHMCS license. We fixed this and publicly apologized about said things. As for the rest of our site is all fixed. As for the viewing of customer servers without their permission and showing them to others this is simply just false. I would love to see Pic / Video / audio proof of us doing this. It is not only a violation of the policies I put in effect but also not something that is just done. When ever we are screen sharing in a public VC it is only from Staff to Staff. At no point do we share any information about this stuff. I would love to figure out where the proof is as well as to how Matt leaked his Direct Admin information because the password is just a bunch of dots for one and for two we get login notifications if it was accessed from a new IP. We take security very seriously and the fact all of you joined our server and within 3 hours came up with this tells me you have no proof other than the mishap of the WHMCS license.
NovaSS - ur exposed stop covering the gigs up and over accept it and move on dude!!!! what happens man just work better to do better but this is mark will haunt u tho guy
RealHD - I'm exposed? I'm confused Still waiting on that proof yes we take the blame for the issue with the WHMCS but there is nothing pointing towards this proof.
Tomas - Actually that's not valid proof of paying for a DirectAdmin licence at all because that's most certainly not a licence bought from DirectAdmin directly, could easily be nulled or manipulated?
NovaSS - nulled means leaked dude that defintely dont look good for you be honest and buy a template man not get leaked assets
RealHD - I was not the one who purchased said things. Before I came into my position I was made aware that everything was good to go and that there was no issues with our site. I happily will take the fall on the WHMCS and Direct Admin as it was overlooked on my transfer into my position. As for the Client information being leaked if there is proof of any of us doing it I would like to see it so I can removed them from the team.
Tomas - someone send the site link
Hyperz - https://jandmhosting.com/
Hyperz - RealHD There is not proof, I have multiple previous staff AND a previous owner of HostNexxus, who have witnessed matt (an employee at the time) committing such actions.
Hyperz - Matt released public user info from his old hosting company, doesn't mean he did it in this one, but his history and offenses should still be made aware to his newer consumer base because who is to say he won't just do it again?
RealHD - I sit in on all of the calls he has to make sure this doesn't happen I am aware of his history.
RealHD - It is a very big concern of mine and I do agree that they should be aware of this. The wording you put in this post makes it seem that he is currently doing this.
Hyperz - Actually, it says word for word:
"Previous Host Nexxus support manager and known to share clients info over screen shares, stream himself logging into clients servers without consent"

It also says: "An owner 'Matt' has been found publicly releasing customer address's live on stream in multiple places, he has also shown himself viewing the virtual servers of his clients WITHOUT THEIR PERMISSION and touching / taking the files on said servers."

Which is entirely true, he was a previous support manager, AND HE IS KNOWN to share clients info over screen shares and stream himself logging into clients servers without consent. And he has been found and caught doing it before.

Nothing I said implies it is currently happening. Your cover up operation is not going to work.
Hyperz - Caden, there isn't really anything against you as a person, however you are defending and working alongside someone like this and you really need to look at the bigger picture here.
RealHD - I completely understand that. I really don't have many options here to begin with. If you would like to VC with me I would love to learn about this more.
Hyperz - Don't believe I share a server with you.
RealHD - You can add me on discord we can talk there. HD#1817
Wizard - RealHD pahhhh denying all the actions to cover your back what a joke
RealHD - Wizard I didn't deny it lmao it has already been talked about hence the change of the original post
