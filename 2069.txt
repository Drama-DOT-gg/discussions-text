Lunaris - Hello everyone, today i was dealing with HuguitisNodes (located at HuguitisNodes.host)
I was dealing with them regarding one of client previously being with them in their hosting them moving to mine. he wanted a full refund but they didnt want to give him one and in the end they didnt. They have stated in their refund policy which is the following in the image 
then in the middle of the argument they have changed it to owned instead of used. which my client previously had followed. and in the spain law it specifially states that for any online products they have the right to refund it in 14 days of purchase. I will be providing all the proof i have caught.

Gamer3514 - i am admin on the server and i told them i can not give a refund because i am not the owner. All i told them was to wait for the owner, and he would sort out a refund
Druggy - This is false, he is missing half of the story No I do not have anything to do with it but most of the important parts are left out.
Gamer3514 - Druggy he is not showing most the info, i said that if they wait for the owner they will probably get a refund however they started arguing
doctormagico - As a Huguitis Nodes mod, I want to show my oppinion.
It's not showing everything.
Second, it should not show screenshots of a ticket, since it is confidential information that could contain emails, passwords...

What I saw is that they only blamed, without arguing well, just because of a ping problem.
Then they demanded a refund when it had already been in use for 1 day.
Timanttikuutio - doctormagico You may want to consider telling the owner to follow the EU laws ðŸ™‚. All EU citizens are entitled to a 14 day refund policy by law, which must be respected by every company providing online services. Oh and the client is in no way required to give a justification for the refund. EU law states a refund must be given without a reason if the service/item has been in use for less than 14 days.
Gamer3514 - Timanttikuutio i told them they have to wait for the owner as he is the one who can do refunds however they started arguing then causing this post to be made
Timanttikuutio - Oh and the 1 day refund policy you guys have right now is 100% illegal
doctormagico - Timanttikuutio I'm not going to talk about this, becaouse I don't want to do things bad,
Wait Huguitis, the owner.
Koisip - Also, where is the company's ToS? 
I found the privacy policy: https://huguitisnodes.host/page/terms - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-11-05/1667667625-419057-image.png
Gamer3514 - Koisip tos is in the terms i believe. we have told them that they will get a refund but have to wait for the owner to be online and do it
doctormagico - Koisip ToS are in the terms.
But wait to Huguitis (owner)
Lunaris - Gamer3514 that has never been said
Lunaris - Druggy and when were you apart if this?
Druggy - Lunaris Always
Druggy - ðŸ™‚
Huguitis - Lunaris Hello, I'm Huguitis.
According to our terms of service, our service is only refundable if you claim it in less than a day, which is not the case for you.

Also, we are not located in EU so we are not required to do 14 day refunds.
Kowone - Huguitis Also, we are not located in EU so we are not required to do 14 day refunds.

didn't know you could create a host under the sea
Huguitis - Kowone Alright, I misunderstood, sorry.
I didn't know that was illegal. I am changing the terms of service.
Kowone - anyway, spain is in EU
Huguitis - Kowone Known, I misunderstood.
Huguitis - The terms of service have been updated.
Lunaris - Huguitis hello huguitis. thank you for responding to this thread. In yours guys terms of service it clearly stated that if he has USED it for less than a day he would have had the right to get a refund. And under EU laws he is eligible for a refund since it hasnâ€™t been 14 days.
Gamer3514 - Lunaris it has been changed
Lunaris - Gamer3514 I have saw that. Due to Spain law you guys are no required to make a refund to people. There is no arguing there
TheDevBird - Wow,

They are now refusing

They legit just changed the TOS and It used to say If I used it for under a day I get a refund.

Wow!

All I want is my money back and they don't seem to understand that Its my money that I want back. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-11-05/1667680308-224069-image.png
Gamer3514 - TheDevBird all i said is we donâ€™t do the 1 day thingy any more and we donâ€™t break any sort of laws
TheDevBird - Gamer3514 But I'm affected by the 1 day thingy since I bought it under that policy,

So please just give my money.
GeoHasCameBack - Read the fucking TOS &amp; TERMS first fucking retards
TheDevBird - GeoHasCameBack They just fucking changed it.
GeoHasCameBack - u still can get the refund back
GeoHasCameBack - 100% or else they are just doing ilegal shit
TheDevBird - GeoHasCameBack  Yes and there not giving me it - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-11-05/1667680903-839428-image.png
TheDevBird - GeoHasCameBack  Yes and there not giving me it - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-11-05/1667680909-120938-image.png
GeoHasCameBack - well try chargeback? or report them lol
TheDevBird - GeoHasCameBack Report to who
Gamer3514 - GeoHasCameBack they donâ€™t seem to be able to cope with the fact that only the owner can do things like refunds. As an admin I canâ€™t do stuff like that, the whole reason this has been made. Because they think admins should have access to the owners bank account and stuff
GeoHasCameBack - @TheDevBird so wait for the fucking owner only the owner can refund u
Druggy - GeoHasCameBack He can't, he just wants to get his money so bad.
GeoHasCameBack - u need to have patience its the key
