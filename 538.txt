Jedrik - Alright, just woke up saw this document on the drama.gg chat, decided to respond.

Yes, you can contact us any time, but you have to take into consideration that we have our own personal life, work, and that timezones exist

We don't claim ALL invalid threads get deleted, it says ALMOST ALL



About me ignoring you, I'm in a different timezone from the other staff members, and believe it or not! I have a life! Yes, we don't stalk threads 24/7!

One of the reasons I didn't delete this is because it seemed like Iceey was gonna go in-depth on their Priv / ToS, I believe I told this to jeekie



for Cloudbud; Yes we saw this, we tried our best blurring his face, hiding private information, etc.


The actual conversation we had in the staff chat:



And finally,

Yes, that is true. I've said this several times and if you've spent even just a minute on the site, you'd realize we do live off of toxicity, I've said it before and I'll say it again, "toxicity comes from drama" I'm not talking about the site drama, I'm talking about actual drama. Same as "there is no peace in war".
We're not stalking hosts 24/7, we don't know the status of hosts, what they've been doing, etc. That's what the members do. We're only a team of (2 at the time) 3 staff members with our own projects, work, etc.
I can't defend mattt on this one, he can do it him self if he chooses to

Deleted User - Disclaimer:
This is not my response, this is just the response the owner of the post wanted me to send.

1st, Yes. I do understand that u have a life (&amp; that I don't), but the threads were on different times &amp; I waited over 3 weeks for a reply from you. (on an alt)

2nd,  You"Thought", you didn't think about asking him?

3rd, his socials are still out there, &amp; you only blurred his face (after like 5 days).

4th, the dismatled threads are still out there &amp; not locked (even if they have msged you)

5th, Yes, I do know drama.gg is full of toxicity, but it's not aimed at you. ()

6th, Let me add more to the toxic community.
Deleted User - FireShooter He wanted me to send that message (because, he didn't trust drama.gg) or something.
FatGrizzly - FireShooter first things first, you are underage for this forum, better yo go off this forum soon
Jedrik - FireShooter 1st, Yes. I do understand that u have a life (&amp; that I don't), but the threads were on different times &amp; I waited over 3 weeks for a reply from you. (on an alt)

In that case, you may contact other staff members (check my profile &gt; threads &gt; the thread where I list out all ways you can contact us)

FireShooter 2nd,  You"Thought", you didn't think about asking him?

The thing is, he already said something about their Priv, can't bring it up rn maybe later I'm eating rn

FireShooter 3rd, his socials are still out there, &amp; you only blurred his face (after like 5 days).

That's public information, he connected them to his discord account, he's publicized a lot of his information to not just us but even to others.

FireShooter 4th, the dismatled threads are still out there &amp; not locked (even if they have msged you)

You may send me the links (Papi Jedrik#1666) I'll be available in around an hour.

FireShooter 5th, Yes, I do know drama.gg is full of toxicity, but it's not aimed at you. ()

Aimed at or not, his point was that I said "we live off of toxicity" and I've already addressed why I say that.
Deleted User - Jedrik In that case, you may contact other staff members (check my profile &gt; threads &gt; the thread where I list out all ways you can contact us)

You should have prob included that
Deleted User - Jedrik You may send me the links (Papi Jedrik#1666) I'll be available in around an hour.

sure,
Deleted User - FireShooter (even tho, it's ur job to do that)
Deleted User - Jedrik That's public information, he connected them to his discord account, he's publicized a lot of his information to not just us but even to others.

That still doesn't hold up it took like like more than 5 days
Deleted User - FireShooter (&amp; that your only doing that cuz he made the post)
Deleted User - FatGrizzly you are underage for this forum

No, I turned 13 yesterday. (I've lied about my age)
Jedrik - FireShooter With hundreds of posts and around 4-7 threads a day, yeah we can't keep up with that with all the stuff in our personal lives, which is why we advise people to contact us
Deleted User - Jedrik &amp; when people do you ignore them
Deleted User - FireShooter Even sloth, I've dmed his multiple times to be ignored.
Jedrik - FireShooter Not really, I have a lot of free time later, can't really balance everything whilst moderating the forum ykyk
Deleted User - Jedrik can't really balance everything whilst moderating the forum ykyk

Suggest making a time for that, or time for when you do stuff, it will make you have more free time &amp; a lot more space.
Deleted User - Jedrik just woke up saw this document on the drama.gg chat

what a pleasant morning
Jedrik - FireShooter Sloth is barely active he's most likely working, logan has his own work + streaming + moderating his fivem server, I have my own projects and spend time with friends a lot, we'll eventually get to it. If we haven't responded in a loong time, you've most likely been denied
Deleted User - Jedrik If we haven't responded in a loong time, you've most likely been denied

Even when I've provided sufficient proof?
Deleted User - Jedrik If you do that, then just (trusting members) to be staff, simple.
Jedrik - FireShooter Look, I'm basically a volunteer, I could just ignore all these and head on my way, but I don't, even sloth told me that "moderating shouldn't get in the way of our personal lives"
Deleted User - Jedrik "moderating shouldn't get in the way of our personal lives"

like I said
Jedrik - FireShooter We can't just "trust members" we've offered some reputable users in the community a spot, but some of them denied and some haven't responded. We're not risking anything by "trusting some members"
Deleted User - Jedrik You claimed that Winterhoax was the easiest app you've ever done.

We're u mates with Sloth, for him to trust you like that. Legit, you get paid 0$ &amp; stress yourself out by drama.gg. You can't enjoy life with drama.gg
Jedrik - FireShooter Kindly give me the username &amp; tag of the account you dmed me on
Deleted User - FireShooter Not to mention, you have to spend your morning dealing with Drama.
Deleted User - Jedrik I deleted all my accounts (u also banned me)
Deleted User - FireShooter &amp; all day, you can't live your life like a normal person, because of a toxic site made for dumb kids.
Deleted User - FireShooter (I admit that) I don't have any proof to back that up, so you can ignore that claim.
Deleted User - FireShooter But, the claims still stand &amp; so do the others.
Chirag - FireShooter and you're here being another "dumb kid". You are 9 years old. You tried reselling free hosts for amazon gift cards. and who knows what other hosts you own/have owned. Kindly fuck off.
Deleted User - Chirag Toxic first.

1st, I HAVE SAID SORRY, SO FORGET ABOUT THE PAST &amp; TRYING TO CHANGE THE TOPIC.

2nd I AM 13 (i LIED ABOUT MY AGE.)
Deleted User - 2nd, your saying stuff which has nothing doing with this topic, so you kindly f off.
Chirag - FireShooter 1st, I HAVE SAID SORRY, SO FORGET ABOUT THE PAST &amp; TRYING TO CHANGE THE TOPIC.

what would've happened if someone actually paid you huh? you'd have committed a crime. and I bet you won't refund that person
Deleted User - Chirag 
You're being toxic &amp; keep tryna change the topic, so I won't respond to further comments, make a Thread about me if u care then.

That was a legit joke, 2nd I would have refunded the person.
Deleted User - FireShooter True
Deleted User - #TakeDownDramaGG UWU jk
Jxck_KV - Chirag You spitting fax bro
Ash777 - @Jedrik good to hear you have life
Nova - Jedrik unban me 😩
Sloth - Nova 👍️
Nova - Sloth really? is that a yes?
Deleted User - Jxck_KV I hate people who get manipulated so easily, do your research before legit choosing a side.
Deleted User - Chirag what would've happened if someone actually paid you huh? you'd have committed a crime. and I bet you won't refund that person

Stop acting like you've never scammed someone, not to mention the various times your making claims without proof.
Deleted User - Nova prob,
Deleted User - Chirag Look, Toki nulled (a theme once) &amp; she changed from that, &amp; you had no problem with that. WHen I made a JOKE HOST (IF YOU COULD NOT TELL, LEGIT ACCEPTING AMAZON GIFTCARD, I PLAYED ALONG BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO EXPLAIN THE JOKE). and thats in the past &amp; so is when Toki wanted to use a nulled theme, so shut up.
Deleted User - Third, I have disputed your claims about me (FOR 3 TIMES NOW), SO SHUT UP ABOUT THAT.

This is just supposed to be a dispute &amp; nothing else, &amp; this is a dispute about drama.gg. So you have no right on this thread to attack me (for the 5th time).
Deleted User - Chirag and you're here being another "dumb kid"

Dude, your 13/14.
Deleted User - FireShooter not to mention toxic idiot
mtt - Jedrik I can't defend mattt on this one, he can do it him self if he chooses to

Ty Jedrik but i have no regrets.
He deserved it.
kthx byee 😍
Deleted User - @Chirag Just admit your wrong &amp; move on, I know It sucks to be wrong, but your a toxic kid, so, you'll never admit you're wrong, I dismantled you, so now your tryna change how people think about me, so shut the fuck up. I should have just let you do that, &amp; not waste my time, but multiple people have you &amp; submitted proof against you. Toxic idiots don't want to admit they are toxic, but just admit that &amp; move on. Motherfucker.
Deleted User - FireShooter I would have been calm (but sense this is the 3th time), so, I am not calm.
Tomas - FireShooter hi bro just come clean and say you wrote the document thx
Deleted User - FireShooter You bring that every time I say something about Drama.gg or post a reply, if you don't notice that, you just stupid. (This is now the 4th time)
Deleted User - Tomas I did, but I am responding to cringe, I mean @Chirag, about his FALSE claims about me.
Deleted User - 2nd, Jedrik is not responding, because I dismantled his claims.
Tomas - FireShooter Jedrik is currently offline and not available
Deleted User - Jedrik around 4-7 threads a day

not it's 0-1-2 a day, check the updates channel &amp; see when the threads are made &amp; how frequently.
Deleted User - Tomas Yeah, But when he was online, I dismantled some of his claims, but he went on living his life &amp; not responding (Yeah, he prob has stuff to do sry.)
Sloth - FireShooter 1. it's 3 am where Jedrik lives; 2. where?
Deleted User - &amp; stop using the term "personal life", bc if u have so much to do, then why r u even an admin on drama.gg..
Tomas - FireShooter Are you insinuating that the Drama.gg Team do not have lives?
Deleted User - Sloth it's 3 am where Jedrik lives

Yeah, I was taking when he was online (Yeah, he prob has stuff to do sry.))
Sloth - Yes cause I totally spend every waking moment on this site to argue with lil' 9 year olds bickering?
Deleted User - Tomas No, I am saying if they have like 15 hours of work, then why are they on drama.gg, bc they aren't able to mod.
Deleted User - Sloth Thats not aimed.
Deleted User - Sloth every waking moment on this site

I'm talking about when you have time, but you're saying you have 10 hours straight of work &amp; Jedrik.
Jedrik - Sloth Woke up at 3:40 am to 2 dms and 3 emails 😩
Sloth - FireShooter Please speak proper English, because I have no clue what your point is.
Deleted User - Jedrik Just go back to sleep.
Yasso - Jedrik imagine raiding a host lmao

neronodes btw
Ash777 - FireShooter doesnt make him dumb
Deleted User - Ash777 This has nothing to do with you, so, you are in no way of responding.
Ash777 - FireShooter who said that
Ash777 - anyone can reply to any post if they want
MysteriousK69 - @FireShooter Just want to say this, you are literally making it obvious that you are 9. Please stop humiliating yourself.
Jedrik - FireShooter Yeah, But when he was online, I dismantled some of his claims

fym You just said the same shit again and again or just made no sense whatsoever. You never "dismantled" my claims
KylePlays - Jedrik 

I like my mom.
Deleted User - Jedrik wdym about slow replies? I conctacted you in dm about a thread and 2 minutes after you did what i asked.. Ita fast reply time!
