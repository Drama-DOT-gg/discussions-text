luffy - acting super sketchy by using a free domain for paid services no automation of any kind at all and using a host when lying about what node they use when it was asked it was hetzner he said no then we showed proof and he says someone gifted him a dedi
eraters - whats the proof and crap
Pamar - eraters dude, as 1 guy in winterhoax discord server said, evidence is text, so here is evidence aka the text which he wrote
Saqib - luffy any discord? or website link
also may you send some screenshots? Thanks.
Tomas - Saqib I'll DM you a link
Jen - luffy right, many big hosts are not automated anyways so like how would that be a scam
and a free domain tbh isn't that sketchy its just a fucking domain
Sloth - Jen Name me one big host that doesn't have some sort of automated billing system, and a host that uses a free domain just shows that they can't pay the 9€ for a domain.
Tomas - Sloth namecheap has .xyz for like 1€
Pamar - Sloth cough I can name a lot of latvian big hosts (as example) which do not have automated billing system, even one of biggest fiber and hosting company in here do not have billing system and it all goes thru telephone support etc
Deleted User - Pretty sure he's referring to big hosts not big latvian hosts. Most people will have never heard of them lmao
Pamar - Jeekie im just saying there ARE BIG HOSTS (with over 500k customers) who have NO BILLING SYSTEM
Deleted User - Pamar hosts that most people know about most likely no
