MaiDub - Well hello, as always, I was traveling and looking at servers, until I saw one called ToolsHosting, it seems to be something like I did without enthusiasm and a reseller at an extreme level.
To begin with, it does not have any TOS channel, and in the only channel called rules, THERE IS NOTHING, second it has a "verification" channel that is almost going to spend 2 days with nothing, (I have already looked with BetterDiscord if it had any channel of hidden cough or in need of a role and no, there is nothing.)

So, in addition to not having all that, I have seen that they are in illegal activities (Cracking), I mean they are a host, and they are selling accounts, tremendous.

So nothing I do not keep mentioning things because it is basically the typical and common of any cheap server, they start as if nothing and they start inviting, someone serious comes to come and sends them to report.









Look at that abysmal price difference LOL, I leave the disboard invitation here.
