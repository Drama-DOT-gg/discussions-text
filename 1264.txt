skittle-chan1212 - Heya Drama.gg Community,
Recently I came across this host Called Thunder Host which neither has a proper Website nor it has a TOS or Privacy Policy. Just another skid host. 
Discord Link: https://discord.gg/tWaevQGKSV
Website: fshosting.xyz just shows this and their tos channel in discord is blank as well and there is no trace of privacy policy anywhere. just another skid host. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-04/1638597285-191967-k.png

UnseenAcoustics - Hello, I noticed they've been using Linode and has it hosted on their panel, and I'm guessing Linode is being used for nodes.

Linode (Free Tier)

Panel/Dashboard is Hosted on Linode: - https://us-east-1.tixte.net/uploads/your-mom-eats.too-much.pizza/Screenshot_2021-12-04_010509.png
Aaron_ - Oh lord
skittle-chan1212 - UnseenAcoustics yeah and probably they use gcp for their mumbai location
Ples - i used to be partnered with this host they used to be known as FS hosting, and yes they do use free trials.
Anonym - Thunder host = fshosting, thread already exists
TheAlex - I think that we need to see how new they are and give them some constructive criticism before going full retard mode
skittle-chan1212 - Ples yeah
Loser - lol
