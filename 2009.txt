Mitk - I knew a guy called Gaming7s, he had a free mc servers hosting. To release it he needed a vps, so me and my company gave him to help him. When he got fame, eliminated my main owners roles ( bc he had ownership ) and banned me. This guy sells what he doesnt even have, ppl thinks its true and buy from him, then, ofc, they dont get what they expected, they get NOTHING. After that, we caught him selling free vps plans of other hostings, so sad. I also met a guy who got scammed by gaming7s, contact with him, he is: MANISH_YT_050#0001
