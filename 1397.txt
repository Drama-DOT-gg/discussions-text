Velox - https://VeloVPS.cf is a new hosting provider based in the Central African Republic, and they're super dodgy. Firstly the deals they promote on their website are unbelievable. Just look at some of these offers, 

"$10/month
3 Months free!

What you will get
AMD RYZEN 5900X CPU
20GB DDR4 RAM
500GB SATA SSD
Location: Bangui, Central African Republic"

Anyways, I thought may aswell try this out. So I went to privacy.com and made a card with a balance of 0$ and tried out their 3 month trial 

And you know what happened? They tried to charge that card of so many amounts, firstly they tried 5$ then 10$ then 100$ then 1000$ and even more. It's like they were trying to trick poor people into loosing all their life savings!

This isn't correct, you guys can try it out on a privacy or prepaid card and see what happens. Or just select the bank transfer option. Let me know if they actually try the same thing - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-01-16/1642325817-863501-a502eb29-f601-4dde-8954-f4f9657a0766.jpg
Velox - Another thing to add, they use freeenom.

Dvij1233 - rickroll?
Jen - I actually feel like people are retarded, When they are using hosts that use a .cf for their domain
Or freenom domains
Or people who have a bad reputation
Like its not our fault that you guys don't have common sense
Maybe use actual VPS providers instead of these discord shopping cart ones
Geo - Stop looking for free trials, btw that web its just to rick roll users
Ples - Geo yeah wtf is he on about its just a site full with rickrolls lol
Geo - Ples lmao
Ibrahim - Ples lmao
HarryW - What do you expect from a Central African Republic host ðŸ˜‚
I donâ€™t even think thereâ€™s even 3 datacenters there
Ibrahim - HarryW LMFAO
HarryW - Velox Donâ€™t forget .CF is the TLD of Central African Republic
Velox - HarryW I mean true
NGX - discord?
Deleted User - Velox false info

Velox They tried to charge that card of so many amounts, firstly they tried 5$ then 10$ then 100$ then 1000$ and even more.

why would they start from the smallest to a higher number lmao? if so they would just stop at $5 cus the card has $0, they probs would start with a higher number then go lower lmfao
