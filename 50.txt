Sloth - Please prove that they are using Contabo VPS' as their dedicated line is ok. Please also provide proof for bad support, low uptime and hilarious performance or remove the tags. Using a contabo vps isnt a felany unless they advertise something else.
Matteo - Sloth Bad support = owner being immature , low uptime : 
hilarious performance = contabo - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-08-16/1597606395-448793-capture.png
Sloth - Matteo 

Please prove that they are using Contabo VPS' as their dedicated line is ok
Matteo - Sloth Mate, do i really need to buy a fucking vps for you to belive it.
Sloth - Fine, Ill let this slide as contabo dedicated servers arent worth it anyways (nobody buys them) and you can get way better for way cheaper at hetzner.
Matteo - Sloth Exactly , it are vpses and they mark them as dedis
Matteo - Contabo vpses
Sloth - Matteo In that case please add the new False Advertising Tag
Talon - Sloth Hello! I am the current owner of this company and I think there is a lot of confusion. First off we DO NOT resell Contabo. We do not like Contabo for the way they treated us in the past. Also we recently switched where our WHMCS was located and we are contacting WHMCS to move our license over to the new location. I am sorry about all of the confusion and hope you understand. Please reply if you have any other questions! Have an amazing day and stay safe!
Talon - Matteo It is an old IP. We are changing our servers now so I am actually currently installing pterodactyl as we speak!
Matteo - Talon We'l see.
Korudo - Talon so where is the whmcs located?
Talon - Korudo Currently working on it being transferred. I got a refund from WHMCS and am getting a license off of a reseller!
Korudo - Talon Thanks for clarifying!
Talon - Korudo This post will be deleted momentarily.
Korudo - Talon Post or thread?
JAY - Talon this is true they don't sell reseller contabo they provide great services
STMR - I can vouch they have WHMCS :)
Talon - Korudo Sorry about late reply. It is on htttps://store.blitzbuilds.org/
Korudo - Talon Ok
Sloth - Post removed. Reason: All claims have been resolved
