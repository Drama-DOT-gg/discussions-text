Vanquish - Let's see, where do I begin.

To start, this hosting company is terrible, among the worst I have ever seen.

Selling FiveM Servers (which is not permitted according to the FiveM ToS)
Unprofessional Staff
Unreliable Services
Not friendly to other hosts.
Kinda bad site.
No Public Node Info
Possibly Stolen ToS

Explanation:
In terms of selling FiveM servers, you can check that here https://cq-servers.com/fivem
A staff member said this in a livechat, this is mainly how they all act. (they were rude sorry, I need to remove the links to asteroid node because of SEO ._.)
They immediately ban you from they're discord server and livechat if your "in another host"
The site is pretty bad some buttons don't really work.
I believe Sloth mentioned that they're ToS was stolen.
eraters - Their**
Vanquish - eraters true story
Two - Sounds professional.

onyx - Vanquish Love how their website is hilariously inconsistent. Example:
At https://cq-servers.com/fivem, your eyes will be drawn to the Three Star plan. Here, it says the CPU usage limit is 350%. Ok, fair enough. BUT, literally scroll down to the next part of the page and it says the same plan only has 300% CPU usage limit.
