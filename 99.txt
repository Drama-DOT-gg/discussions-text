eraters - Ash decided once he got banned from a server that "Oh yeah! It's a good idea to have my bot nuke this server!" I'll have proof at the end. After that, I had one of my bots nuke his server as revenge, but it's even worse for the owner of the server Ash nuked, because this person had actually paid money for advertisement. His server only had like 20 members, but the one he nuked had over 100. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-09-25/1601061504-303579-image.png
Neon - Ok eraters, First of all Id like to say GG on the 99th post. Second of all, Ash made a discord bot host using Contabo. That is what eraters nuked back.
