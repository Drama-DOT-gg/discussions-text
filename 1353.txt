DarkInk - this post is shit tbh it provides no proof of anything really

CODER The nodes are always offline most of the time, I never saw all the nodes online on that

The nodes that are online right now are the only nodes? The other ones that show offline aren't open to being used. 

CODER let's talk about community, they are toxic as hell, and a bunch of kids sending memes.

I see nothing wrong with the memes and it is toxic? No shit everybody knows this

CODER By many peopleâ€™s words, they say that Dan threatened to sue a hosting company and Dan did illegal activities such as DDoS attacks against them.

you provided no proof tho - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-01-01/1641069183-301322-ef96660b-2100-492c-9e67-b9cfc1c50788.jpg
Dark - Microwave I havenâ€™t said that, but memes in lounge is childish. And we can say that they are kids in DBH who want free resources.
Dark - Note: even there is a memes channel but people dont get punished for miss topic
Dark - DarkInk I didnt said that they were toxic because of the memes, read again. Dan ddosed hosts and that is a fact, the host itself was named Listed.Host and they had a C&amp;D for copyright infringement. Also why dont you talk about past nodes who got data loss and past data breaches. Node 2 got fucked up and data got lost. About the website It doesnt contain the ToS or Privacy Policy.
Dark - ToS and privacyâ€™s policy shouldnt been in cdn
Deleted User - CODER The nodes are always offline most of the time, I never saw all the nodes online on that

Every currently released node is online and working without any issue, the ones that you see offline havenâ€™t been released yet. Only a few nodes have been enabled after DBH v2's release.

CODER lets talk about community, they are toxic as hell and a bunch of kids sending memes.

I agree that part of the community is toxic, but what is wrong with sending memes? Every single server on Discord have a channel for memes. 

CODER Imagine using commands in general chats as lounge

Anything wrong with doing that? It's our problem if we do not mute for using music commands in general, Dan is ok with that so I canâ€™t find any issue with doing this. 

CODER lets take a look at their website quality

The website is currently being remade, and the host mainly relies on the Discord server at the time I am writing this, so that is not a main issue. 

CODER By many peopleâ€™s words, they say that Dan threatened to sue a hosting company and Dan did illegal activities such as DDoS attacks against them.

You did not provide any proof for that. 

CODER lets take a look at other peopleâ€™s reviews on this company

So since today sending a screenshot of a company's Trustpilot reviews is exposing them? Cool.
Dark - Dotto It is a node and it is offline and I dont care if it is released or not. About the memes, there is a channel about that but your shitty moderation donâ€™t punish people for posting stuff wich should be in another channel and it is childish. About Dan ddosing and threating to sue it is a fact. As I mentioned DanBot Hosting did a Cease and Desist against Listed.Host for copyright infringement. And posting reviews of other people opinion about the host and posting facts isnt good? Think twice.
Dark - Also dont forget the ToS and Privacy Policy. A registered hosting company with no ToS and privacy policy
Chirag - Dark threating to sue

threatening, and since when are cease and desist letters illegal?
Dark - Bingo! What you guys gonna say now? - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-01-01/1641072936-130098-f167ec23-0b7e-4e63-817d-5869592fc27b.png

Dark - Chirag check the proof provided now about that
Chirag - Dark idk what you smoking, or when's that ss from, currently whatever nodes should be online are online lmao: 

and uh, well, Xcyth totally didn't just yoink dbh's tos lmao - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-01-01/1641073222-783416-image.png
DarkInk - Chirag LMAO I'm 100% sure those ss's are from the other DBH post. I dropped a zip file that had all those ss's and all the text from the post
Dark - Chirag but It says DanBot Hosting is sending cease and desist to Listed.Host, idk what happened after that. Also nodes are offline as you can see, but seems you are blind.
Dark - DarkInk they are since node 2 got data loss and I took screenshot of it
DinoTheDev - Hi, I'm the one in that screenshot talking to Xcyth. Dan realized his mistake and made an apology to Xcyth there was no legal action.
Dark - DinoTheDev no legal action? Let me send you something
Bocon - Dark Just grow tf up and accept the truth dumbass
DinoTheDev - Dark Alright.
DinoTheDev - Dark You can send it here
Dark - DinoTheDev - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-01-01/1641073832-37751-03044bb0-b4cd-4039-bff8-9dd65fd53005.jpg
Deleted User - Dark is a node and it is offline and I dont care if it is released or not

You donâ€™t care if a node is released or not? Then why are you making this thread lmao.

Dark About the memes, there is a channel about that but your shitty moderation donâ€™t punish people for posting stuff wich should be in another channel and it is childish.

Not my fault if we are not a Pablo mod meme and we do not mute people for posting memes in general. 

Dark As I mentioned DanBot Hosting did a Cease and Desist against Listed.Host for copyright infringement.

Just like Chirag said, since when cease and desist letters are illegal?

Dark Think twice.

You should've thought twice before starting to hate a host just because we did not change your server type from Python to NodeJS a few months ago. Starting to hate a company just because of that is ridiculous, but itâ€™s your opinion and Iâ€™m going to respect it.
Chirag - Dark since when the fuck are cease and desist letters illegal lmfao? what the actual fuck are you smoking rn? i really gotta know
DinoTheDev - Dark Yes but may I ask were did you get that?
Bocon - Dark The letter states if the content was removed within 7 days legal action would be further taken.
Please also provide the source that this came from
Dark - Chirag Threats are illegal also i didnt mention cease and desist as the lawsuit, they are different thing so check the proof of dan threating to sue a company.
Dan1 - We are waiting for the ToS and PP from a external company who i paid 60$ for. (From the person who mastermined stole the ToS from)
There is only 4 released nodes currently 
Our team has responded to most trustpolit reviews and agree a few months ago our uptime was not the best. Over the last few months however we have seen a very high increase in uptime, Node 2 sitting at 98% and node 3 sitting at just above 95% as logged by stats from the status page. 
There was never any legal action against listed.host however there was a talk of one but it was a miss-understanding and i have since apologised to Xcyth
Site is currently broken due to the lack of devs. i have just finished overtime on my job where i spent 6 out of 7days working and i have just ended a 1.5year contract with another host i was part of as a sys-admin giving me more time to work on DBH as a company and hiring people. 
However one giant thing i do agree with is the discord server, its toxic as hell, personally i wouldnt want to be near a server that toxic
About the sue against listed.host that was never made by any of the company staff. it was made by a memeber who stole ToS and PP. If someone still has the screenshot of that i would like to get a copy of that please so i can send it to the person who mastermined stole the ToS and PP from
Dark - DinoTheDev got it from online cdn posted from mastermined
Bocon - Dark Depending on the state threats of minority like this would not be illegal
DinoTheDev - Dark Hm alright I guess.
Bocon - Dark 
Dont trust mastermined 
 That proves nothing
Dark - Dan1 ok Dan the guy who "stole tos" his real name is Beatriz Alanis, Former CEO of JourneyHost also you still operating without tos and privacy policy
Dan1 - Dark Yes i understand we currently are. I have a temp copy of the ToS i will be posting in a few hours but as for the official copy im still waiting for that
Dark - Dan1 As i mentioned I dont know what happened after that C&amp;D, just mentioned that it was a thing.
Dark - About Beatriz I can tell who he is in DMs
kritical - this server aint doing shit bout the false bans tho

I've seen 2 members banned in the last week for no good reason
Dan1 - Dark yeah thats fine, Thats actually the first time iv seen that document if only i had that before he had no rights to even send it nevermind make it
Dan1 - kritical there was 2 people banned yesterday for the nword in their messages. May i know who so i can look into this?
kritical - the owner just gets people to donate and then bans them for a fake or dumb reason to grab cash
kritical - Dan1 someone named kyle and cyandie
one was banned for a out of context death threat
and another was banned for a ddos attack that didnt even happen
Chirag - Dan1 const kritical = "cyanide";
i can already tell from the way they talk lmao
Dark - Dan1 Beatriz Alanis had a past problem with a old staff member wich he didn pay and he wanted to sue Beatriz
Dan1 - kritical Kyle is no longer banned and Cyandie has not yet provided proof that said website is fake
kritical - Dan1 if someone is banned wouldn't they not be able to dm you unless they shared servers?
Bocon - kritical 

There is no proof if the ddos attack was successful or not 
Kyle has been unbanned since then
kritical - how would they have a way of contacting you?
Dan1 - kritical they are friends with me on discord
Dark - kritical if you have proof send it.
Deleted User - kritical It's stated in the rules that if you want to appeal you can also email support@danbot.host
kritical - Dark I dont have any proof, i;m just going off what i have seen
kritical - how does someone prove the website is fake?
Dan1 - If im able to get proof of said website is fake i will happy unban them. Without proof it looks like a very legit site - https://cyanide1x.is-a-virg.in/5jLeFsQKq.png
DarkInk - kritical source code of the fake website or link to it? I don't see how that's so hard or even yk the tools that they used to make it
Bocon - kritical  They can send the src
Dark - Gonna point out that the host still operates without ToS and Privacy Policy, the threat about lawsuit(not cease and desist you blind punks) was a thing and I have proof of that. Downtime problems, data losses and data breaches were a thing.
Bocon - Dark This has already been answered why bring it up again?
Deleted User - Dark isn't this the 4th time you write the same thing
Dan1 - Dark Im working on getting ToS out right now from the copy i hage. PP im waiting on

the lawsuit was never going to happen but yes the talk of one was there. 

As for downtime problems since the last 2 months we have managed to solve about 95% of our downtime issues now and have since had no more data losses too due to better management systems
Bocon - Dotto Exactly my point he keeps reposting the same shit after it was already answered/resolved.
Microwave - Dark There is no rule against going off channel topic, if you don't like it then leave.
Dark - Dan1 1.The talk was a threat 2. About the ToS and Privacy Policy it is your problem since you are the one not operating with those 3.since when you started changing your mind over the uptime because you said you had 99.9% but now you say it is 95% - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-01-01/1641075170-851803-3737e141-d3f5-4952-82d0-170325c8b28b.jpg
DinoTheDev - Dark Everyone's going to have a data breach. It's a fact of the internet.
Jen - Dark I don't understand, I've seen email support faster than a damn ticket system
Bocon - Dark He answered your question if you cant wrap that around your small ass brain maybe you should get your fat ass off drama.gg and go back to pre-K.
Dan1 - Dark We since had a SSD upgrade as the health of the old ones were low causing a few hours of downtime that took that % down a tiny bit
Deleted User - Dark do you realise that the review talks about the uptime in the last 30 days?
Dark - Jen that is a fact. I like that.
Dark - Dotto the message sent here is in "the last 30 days"
DinoTheDev - Dark If you're talking about the hacking incident when Dan had to reinstall Nodes, he had backups on most of them and you could've opened a ticket to request your files.
Dark - Dan1 when why you lying about your uptime
Jen - Dark its sooo fucking true. I've seen email support reply faster and gets the problem resolved.
Dan1 - Dark the downtime happened in the last 10days. That comment was over 20days ago
Bocon - Dark 
Jen 
DBH Is a small company with little staff, The staff members are overworked, stressed, and overall done with DBH and its community. I personally know a few staff members and they all say the same thing. Imagine if you had to deal with a community, hundreds of tickets, and school/work.
Dark - Jen better than having tickets left open since several monthsðŸ˜‚
Chirag - Jen meanwhile discord in 2020: please wait 30 years
Dan1 - Heres the ToS as posted in the discord: ToS
Deleted User - Dark 13 dec 2021's last 30 days = 13/11/2021 to 13/12/2021. Last 30 days now = 1/12/201 to 1/01/2022. Just like dan said there has been some downtime, so if you can do some basic maths itâ€™s perfectly possible for the uptime to go down to 95% in that amount of time.
Dark - Bocon i have dealt with toxic communities and I know how hard it is but this community is easy to handle but they arent handling it
Dark - Dan1 still privacy policy is no where
Bocon - Dark First of all DBH is not easy to handle, You have never been staff so you don't know. You cant speak before trying it fucking dumbass
Deleted User - Dark easy to handle? Itâ€™s pretty clear that you havenâ€™t looked at the chat in the last 4 days lmao.
Dan1 - Dark Its coming. i have just questioned the person who is making them if its ready yet. Waiting for the response
Deleted User - Dark here we go, thatâ€™s the 5th time you say this.
Dark - Bocon I havent been a staff member but I have been an admin inside a discord server with over 1.5k members and DBH isnt that much active as that server in that time
Bocon - Dark It was stated in the #legal channel that the PP is currently being created.
Dan1 - Dark the discord at the moment from how toxic it is. isnt just something that can be fixed in a few days. its going to take weeks or maybe months to get it back to how it was
Dark - Dan1 who is the person making them?
Bocon - Dark DBH is a very active server do you have eyes?
DinoTheDev - Dark Yea cool, we're not talking about your discord server though? (Sorry if I'm being toxic)
Bocon - Dark Why are you all up in his pussy?
Dark - Bocon 
Read it - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-01-01/1641075878-379365-c03f72a4-0836-4073-9f0e-005b0337e81e.jpg
Dark - DinoTheDev That hasnt been my discord server but I worked for that discord server and now it is deleted but I used to be admin there
Bocon - Dark I cant understand your shitty ass English cuz ur in the fucking 3rd grade
Dark - Bocon I said it isnt much active as the server I worked on as Admin before also your level of toxicity is high now
Bocon - Dark We dont really care stop going of the topic, This thread was created about DBH not your little shitty server
Dan1 - Just so i got this right the current issues that iv managed to find:

PP Needs posting ASAP once i have it available
Tickets need to be sorted faster with a possible better requests system so its easier to manage
Toxic discord needs to be sorted ASAP

Anything else i can add to this list so i can at least make a start?
Deleted User - Dark every server is different, I am admin in a 750 members server and nobody ever chats here. Then?
Dark - Bocon The DBH server got mentioned you idiot
Bocon - Dark You stated facts about your server, also dan is waiting for a reply from you
Dark - Dan1 you should figure that out for yourself
DinoTheDev - Dan1 I would like to help with toxicity, but I'm not pushing you.
Dark - Bocon ILikeYourCutG#2968 here is my discord account
 and dan can contact me there
Dan1 - Dark Well thats the known issues i know about. without being a member myself im unable to know exactly what needs doing.
Bocon - Dan1 
Suggestion: Hire more staff because your current staff are very stressed because there is too much shit for them to handle
Dark - Dan1 ask your members not drama.gg
Armic - Dan1 I would say new ticket system should be high on the list as the current one isn't working
Bocon - Dark Most members on this thread are from DBH
Microwave - Bocon cough
Dan1 - Armic Couldnt agree more. The current ticket system is confusing, a mess and at times. hard to read in general
Deleted User - Dan1 we also need some nice, new / improved rules that actually "block" loopholes and that somehow "protects" staff from stuff like people harassing us after being muted etc
Dark - Bocon he can ask his members in DBH discord server since some members of drama.gg arent from DBH
Deleted User - Armic I agree
Microwave - Dan1 says the person that took part in making it...
Dan1 - Dark Well you have been a member for some time. What do you see that needs changing? Meanwhile i will be asking the discord later see what they want
Dan1 - Microwave I havent touched any part of the ticket system in a long time. Its changed a lot since i last made a change in it. back in the day there was a easy way:
If request is still valid. message is still there

now its if request is still valid or not valid, message is still there either way
Dark - Dan1 ok so if you want suggestions from me or any ideas just DM me
Armic - Microwave the ticket system has been around for a while. Were talking about when dbh only had 2 nodes it worked fine then
Bocon - Dark Just post it publicly?
Armic - Bocon post it publicaly when yall are acting like children everytime he posts a complaint about dbh
Microwave - Dan1 which is exactly why its broken...
Dark - Bocon I donâ€™t want to post it here since I donâ€™t want opinions from you guys but I want it from Dan
Dan1 - Dark Im always up for feedback to help improve. Be sure to DM me with anything you want
Dark - Armic exactly
Dark - Dan1 you can friend me on discord
Z81D - Dan1 ive been a member for almost 1.5 yr look at my suggestion 10/10
Robert - There are already multiple threads about DBH, and most if not all of the evidence that you are providing is not anything that is illegal. I will be locking this, if you want to continue continue it in one of the other threads or just do it on Discord or something.
