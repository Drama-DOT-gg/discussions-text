3__E - So first Dux were like omg 3__E pls buy the 400 member server and I will pay u 30 dollars after a few days
And he was like begging me so I told him u can pay using nitro
Then he was begging for ownership even though he paid me literally nothing
And when I tried to change something(e.g the date etc) he was like
Then he gave me these random useless promises
Then he just started delaying everything
btw he first said he will pay me on monday
And because he was delaying way too much I asked him to give me nitro cus he said he had one already
Then he was like ok lets stick to the nitro thing and I will give soon
Then this time when he wants to change the price he was like YoU aRe A sCaM
And he just does the bad things
 
 And when I tried to stick to what we agreed on he was like ScAm 
 
Now he is just saying that I am scamming him 

Now I dont want to change anything mr scam was like ur scamming

Then we agreed on 20 dollars in paypal

And then he just said things about him and dubs which I dont give a fuck at all

Then he delayed it once again (btw just a reminder we agreed on Monday when he first decided to buy it so now he delayed 2 days)

Then he started to send me generated credit card that doesn't work at all



Notice that they have literally the same BIN (the number that is started off with, 426986 and 60457811 in this case which clearly tells that this was generated)
Guy searched up credit card generator and said it was bought from wish

Ah yes 100% no generated but from wish
And now he lowered the price once again to $10 dollars

And then he just started calling me scammer because he tried to sell the server to another guy which I dont know about

So yea, in conclusion dux wantted me to buy the 400 ppl server from dubs and promised to pay it on monday, but delayed all the way to thursday and lowered the price from 30 all the way to 10 and all the way to 0 because he is an actual scammer. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-01-12/1641982504-141203-image.png

And now he lowered the price once again to $10 dollars

And then he just started calling me scammer because he tried to sell the server to another guy which I dont know about

So yea, in conclusion dux wantted me to buy the 400 ppl server from dubs and promised to pay it on monday, but delayed all the way to thursday and lowered the price from 30 all the way to 10 and all the way to 0 because he is an actual scammer. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-01-12/1641983079-769495-image.png
3__E - So first Dux were like omg 3__E pls buy the 400 member server and I will pay u 30 dollars after a few days
And he was like begging me so I told him u can pay using nitro
Then he was begging for ownership even though he paid me literally nothing
And when I tried to change something(e.g the date etc) he was like
Then he gave me these random useless promises
Then he just started delaying everything
btw he first said he will pay me on monday
And because he was delaying way too much I asked him to give me nitro cus he said he had one already
Then he was like ok lets stick to the nitro thing and I will give soon
Then this time when he wants to change the price he was like YoU aRe A sCaM
And he just does the bad things
 
 And when I tried to stick to what we agreed on he was like ScAm 
 
Now he is just saying that I am scamming him 

Now I dont want to change anything mr scam was like ur scamming

Then we agreed on 20 dollars in paypal

And then he just said things about him and dubs which I dont give a fuck at all

Then he delayed it once again (btw just a reminder we agreed on Monday when he first decided to buy it so now he delayed 2 days)

Then he started to send me generated credit card that doesn't work at all



Notice that they have literally the same BIN (the number that is started off with, 426986 and 60457811 in this case which clearly tells that this was generated)
Guy searched up credit card generator and said it was bought from wish

Ah yes 100% no generated but from wish
And now he lowered the price once again to $10 dollars

Dubs - 3__E dux is 100% the scammer here ngl
SamCoThePug - Dubs no, ur the scammer
Dubs - Duxlolz It all started with dubs said I’m selling my discord servers, but after I did Rus dms me a screenshot of Dubs saying he sold Rus's 2nd account

I never sold rus's second account. You can dm him and he has access to that account right now.
Dubs - Duxlolz Dubs also scammed someone into buying a server and  telling someone else to scam them

I never scammed anyone into buying a server. I can show proof of payments sent to me and I can show the dms with the people that bought whatever. If you are talking about mcworld smp, they scammed me out of the server by getting me to go first. I knew thewere going to scam me so I added my nuke bots before I gave ownership. When he banned me from the discord and blocked me, I started the raid.
Dubs - Duxlolz Dubs also called me a Faggot and told me to kill myself, how unprofessional dubs, so so sad,

Because you were spreading false information and lies about me in a discord server, I can't remember which one, but I do remember that.
Dubs - SirCat Read my replies. I've literally never scammed someone. And wtf do you mean "wtf will he do with EarthNodes then"
