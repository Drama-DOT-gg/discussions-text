babyharpseal - Hello! So today, I was searching for hosts on disboard because I was bored, and turns out I found a kinda sus hosting, so I decided to join the Discord Server. I asked for their ToS and Privacy Policy, about ToS, here's what the owner said;

About Privacy Policy, he said this: 

I asked for their node IP, and the owner didn't sent me to it, so I guess they are using Vultr Free Credits or something similar.

The best part of it, it's that it's a paid MC hosting... ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
There's much more, but it will take me years to write everything. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-05/1620240558-690572-imagen.png
