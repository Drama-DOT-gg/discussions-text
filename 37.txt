So i was reselling from them assuming everything on their site was legit (i'm an idiot i know).
Untill one of my clients dropped me a whois(which i never heard of untill then).

They resell Contabo VPS'es as Dedicated Servers (without ssh access keep in mind).
Proof of contabo : 
WHOIS : 


CEO BenSon was a dickhead, as most of you know i'm pretty young (13).
Resulting in calls where i would ask for help and he would sigh and generally be a dickhead (resulting in me being sad as fuck and not even having the courage to even ask for help anymore) I sadly do not have any screenshots/recordings of that as it all happend in call. However when i confronted them about their Contabo shit, BenSon was pissed he would go on about how i am an idiot and that it's bullshit and that they had a subnet etc...
So then i stopped hosting there.

Not to mention they also scammed me making me pay $10 for a theme from mcm which was $5.

Image he sent me of the theme. (Also using that theme on the ss from earlier)

Theme on MCM.

Talon - Matteo LMFAO
europa - damn they're violating pterodactyl's license too
eraters - been a few too many days mate
Akash_ - europa wait how haha
Jen - Matteo your pretty old. Customers are usually the one right anyways. I knew ur stuff was sketch when I checked it out. Lmao you can't access your own files. What kind of system do u use
JordanPlayz158 - @Matteo Word of advice for the future if you still plan to do hosting, don't use install scripts, read and follow the documentation and more importantly learn the basics on linux before diving into things like hosting, it will help you in the long run.
JAY - Matteo i dont understand you gonna diss them for buying a theme atleast they edited it nothing wrong with that
JAY - JAY ngl the contabo looking hot but they should rlly move providers
Iceey - JordanPlayz158 what's wrong with scripts made by professionals? unless you mean backdoored scripts
Wild_TFS - BUMP
