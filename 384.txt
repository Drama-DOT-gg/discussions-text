6vz - Hello! I would not have written this if it were not for the behavior of a certain individual, his name is DomeQ. He runs his own Hosting "mee6.gay" which he wants to promote as much as possible.

Sorry for that in advance, but all posts are in Polish. If you would like to see the translations please contact me on Discord (6vz#4123), or use OCR translator eg. Yandex Translator, or Google Translator at your phone



Let's start with his website ... Of course, he can't do something himself, but only be a parasite and steal from others. Its homepage was copied 100% from cheems.dog. Of course, I recommend that you compare and find out for yourself ...

cheems.dog (ORIGINAL)
mee6.gay (COPY)



Now listen, it's gonna be funny, and it's going to be cheeky. Domeq once made Token Grabber public on YouTube, when you downloaded this program your token went to DomeQ's Webhook





The next argument will be spreading not true information ... DomeQ on its server has published a message comparing other hosts with its hosting. As you can imagine, the data is obviously fake ...





The next argument is that DomeQ uses stolen cards and credit accounts to improve boost levels. He admitted it himself





In the case of cheems.dog, it says it's hosted on free hosting, another lie. cheems is hosted on zap-hosting. But maybe you can say what you are hosting mee6.gay on?





EDIT: DomeQ decided to change his username because he learned that his name is associated with crimes he has committed. He also mentioned that he was creating a new account under a different username. The search continues, when we find out something, we will inform you

Pixwl - I've just found this. WTF is happening? I can assure you that this is all fake. DomeQ has never made a Token Grabber in his life. 


This is fake.

6vz This is real. mesik was DomeQ's old moderator.


The data is not fake.
