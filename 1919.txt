Artiom - Luxxy hosting - luxxy stealer

Luxxy is a old friend that was supposted to be nice but since he got his own hosting, he started comporting very strange.

He started stealing work and not giving and credits. He stole:

- artiomshosting privacy policy
https://artiom.host/privacy_policy.pdf
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/947234663771029624/971138673909305394/privacy_policy.pdf
I know it's not a good privacy policy, but I did a disclaimer that I will improve it later on
- darkerink's proxy bot

- artiomshosting bot


- dotto's statusMonitor

And didn't give any credits. And the authors of the codes are really pissed because of that ( including me )
 
Luxxy also stole codes from other people that hosted on his company before. breaking his pricacy policy act.




I tried to create a ticket on their discord server, but they closed it instantly when saw the word "credits". Luckily they have a  channel log system and the messages were saved

cyanide - Oh and he also stole the LofiBot that I coded and turned it into an egg without giving any credit.
Toki0179 - Changed now, probably loading or something. ðŸ˜­ my bad. Anyway rip he seems like a bit of an asshole
Safira - So luxxy is a skid?
Safira - i never knew that, I'm removing my bot from his hosting server. Maybe that's why one day all our codes where deleted!
MikeLaw - The proxy bot was open source as the hosting bot, both on github, according to your theory if i use ubuntu im skidding because i didn't put credits to the coders...
MikeLaw - But after all, i am an "admin", i dont have any kind of perm and also luxxy doesnt wanna give me a vps.....
DarkInk - MikeLaw The proxy bot was open source

The bot was Open Sourced because he stole it what??



I also have a ton of different images of him saying it was stolen. It wasn't even given to him by @Bocon So I'm not sure what type of crack you are smoking. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-05-05/1651717083-556508-image.png
MikeLaw - Also accept friend request need to talk

Urgent, kinda.
MikeLaw - @DarkInk whats ur discord user
Bocon - DarkInk Yeah at the time the bot was closed source (paid).
MikeLaw - Bocon  ello
Artiom - MikeLaw the bot is now open source all because of luxxy. But before luxxy stealing it, it was proprietary/closed source.

Theory:
dark gave the code to bocon and bocon hosted his bot on luxxy's panel where luxxy have administrator and luxxy just stole the code and started blaming bocon for that (that bocon gave it). Dark seeing that luxxy won't delete the files, opened source it and added a license. 

Conclusion: LUXXY STEAL FILES
Mastermined_ - I can vouch for ArtiomsHosting in this thread since I was the first one to bring to his attention to make a privacy policy because he would get a thread, we were on voice and he was like "Damn who deleted my Privacy Policy?" And I knew he was lying, since his #legal channel stood still too long.

I can say that He then copied ArtiomsHosting Privacy Policy with ownership of Artiom and the author Dibster, this is considered an Intellectual Property theft or Copyright Infringement.


LuxxyHosting is not a good company at all, the owner is stealing someoneâ€™s work to profit of it and doesnâ€™t give any credits.
Bocon - Artiom Wasnâ€™t hosted on luxxys panel, it was on my panel
Win - So crackheads, all those things are now open source, every item you listed out is open source now, 
artiom.host - Privacy Policy, not copyright so not legally bonded to them
darkerproxybot- While yes, luxxy stole it from bocon, bocon did give luxxy access to his servers
artiomhosting bot - open source and just dbh host but in v13
statusmontior - open source license says you can edit it, 
all of these things you didn't put credit in yourself expect dotto's status monitor, you can't blame a guy for not putting credit if its not against the license or you didn't write it yourself.
Win - You are basically saying, oh he should of put credit into something that we didn't even put our names in, if its not needed there is no reason for a person to put them, its respectful but again its not needed.
Toki0179 - MikeLaw you stupid? An open source bot and an operating system will have very different licenses. You are just being ignorant and making yourself look absolutely braindead in the process.
DarkInk - Win You are basically saying, oh he should of put credit into something that we didn't even put our names in, if its not needed there is no reason for a person to put them, its respectful but again its not needed

What??? I wasn't even going to open source my ProxyBot. I shouldn't need to give myself credit for something I wasn't going to give other people. I only gave Bocon so he could run it for his hosting at the time. I open-sourced it to get credit since he seems to want to take all of it for making half the things he stole but since it is now open sourced I think I should get credit for him using it.
Toki0179 - DarkInk If it's stated in the license that he must be giving credit to the creator of the bot then he is in the wrong. If you were stupid and didn't put that in the license, then I suggest adding it now.
DarkInk - Toki0179 If it's stated in the license that he must be giving credit to the creator of the bot then he is in the wrong. If you were stupid and didn't put that in the license, then I suggest adding it now

I added the License when I open-sourced it.
Toki0179 - DarkInk does the license actually say anything about them crediting the creator of the project?
Bocon - Win  That doesnâ€™t matter? While I did give him access it was still paid content that he had no right to steal.
DarkInk - Toki0179 does the license actually say anything about them crediting the creator of the project?

yea?
Deleted User - Win statusmontior - open source license says you can edit it, 
all of these things you didn't put credit in yourself expect dotto's status monitor, you can't blame a guy for not putting credit if its not against the license or you didn't write it yourself.

StatusMonitor-Server's licensed under the GPL 3.0 license and every change must be publicly available (the license states this). StatusMonitor itself has a footer that says "Copyright @ 2022 &lt;%= companyName %&gt; - Powered by StatusMonitor by DottoXD", and that was removed.
Iâ€™m honestly not angry / mad or anything but ehâ€¦thatâ€™s not a nice thing to do. Heâ€™s not using it anymore now so eh.
Innocent - Win True, true with the Bocon part. Luxxy hosting has access to every single persons files when they sign up, but we believe in privacy, but we do have that access to the servers for support, etc.
Innocent - Bocon where is the original source for the content?
Bocon - Innocent I paid darkerink for the bot if thatâ€™s what you mean.
Innocent - Bocon got it.
Innocent - cyanide Didn't you go rogue against luxxy hosting, because you were a developer &amp; leave the server before coming back?
Mastermined_ - Innocent Didnâ€™t you ignored a cease and desist order? Imagine doing Intellectual Property theft and Copyright Infringement.

You have the right to remain silent.
Mastermined_ - Innocent your "believing in privacy" is not a thing then LuxxyHosting steal a Privacy Policy. We have proper proof you did so I am serious.

CharityLexus - There is only one user that will have access to this information, which is we at Luxxy Hosting.
  
 how many staff members actually have access to the panel and files tho?
Mastermined_ - CharityLexus Nice question to him actually, I really like it, just wanna rephrase that they have a stolen Privacy Policy, before they stole, they didnâ€™t have any privacy policy and they log peopleâ€™s data. What I can say, is mostly that every user data is not secure and could be even accessed by the staff, horrible. Imagine not having a data protection officer in a stand and let him only access the data.


Now, Innocent, you may answer his question.
Artiom - Many people think that I raided luxxy because I hate him. The answer is NO, I didn't raid him. I don't really like to get into selfbots and stuff. yes, I know javascript &amp; discord.js, I could learn how to make discord self bots and raid servers, but I won't and never will, I don't want to violate discord ToS and get banned by ip.
Innocent - Mastermined_ this order won't work on me, because I am not affiliated with luxxy in anyway apart from being the "admin" of his server. I don't even care enough to look at the privacy changes.
Innocent - Mastermined_ Imagine trying to sue someone on the basis, but he has nothing to do with the backend of luxxy hosting, but we did make some changes to the privacy policy. I have yet to wait for luxxy to update it.
Innocent - Mastermined_ 

Stolen privacy policy can be confirmed. We didnt have the policy before because of luxxy. God I do not know what he did. Here is the thing. The backend is a bit confusing.
Innocent - PurpleCube can I get the pterodactyl marketplace discord?
Innocent - PurpleCube As much as I would believe your statement. I recently gained some evidence that this is not the case. On the Pterodactyl market discord server, I created a ticket that inquires on this case. The response I got was... Well, see for yourself. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-05-11/1652286765-356106-image.png
PurpleCube - Innocent Here's the message link. https://discord.com/channels/701968138681450516/751579872740114544/944227710757130302

I thought from the luxxy.xyz screenshot it was actually LuxxyHost. My bad, I'll delete my reply to stop any misinformation. I should've checked a bit more before posting the reply, there's always next time.
Mastermined_ - Innocent I got told that you had to hand it over to luxxy, thats all I need. You have one day left since this day of this post, if your executives or luxxy doesnâ€™t give me a respond, I will file what I got to file. Apart of that, the changes, I donâ€™t think there are any changes to the privacy policy until this day.
Mastermined_ - Also, "not affiliated with Luxxy", read the cease and desist again, it is addressed to LuxxyHosting and you are affiliated with that.
J0SH - AHahah what, cease and desist? you're literally all 13
Innocent - Mastermined_ Hmm. You could say that we stole the artiom pp in our older pp, but you have no right to say that we stole the Zoidcloud pp for our new pp. One line in our pp states this

while zoidcloud didn't say this.

FatGrizzly - Innocent AHAHAHAHAHAHA
Mastermined_ - Innocent So, you are trying to hide the orignial pp by blasting a post here about a pp thats not stolen, let me gather what I have.

just do a comparison, of these:

and 
â€¢ https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/971131454245462056/974101251929296896/Luxxy_Hosting___Privacy_Policy.pdf


Also, Luxxy got DMCA'd. Nobody would have been DMCA'd if he didnâ€™t steal anything. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-05-12/1652342208-354540-a21e0d5e-5ac7-4b00-83e8-4b38468670df.png

Mastermined_ - "I get banned for no reason" - Luxxy The Stealer
Innocent - Mastermined_

Did you forget about how the pp has been replaced &amp; isn't stolen?
Mastermined_ - Innocent did you forget about your lies saying that a person called "H3NRY". Luxxy is afraid to get face to face with me, so he sent you over here to deal with us. If he is that good guy, why doesnâ€™t he come here. Or he fears me since I DMCA'd him and thought he do get away. 

You have the right to remain silent.
Innocent - Mastermined_ Did you forget that the pp was replaced at 2pm yesterday? The content was deleted.
Innocent - Mastermined_ - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-05-12/1652370733-300568-screenshot-20220512-085141.jpg
Innocent - Mastermined_ AS I SAID. The ALLEDGEDLY stolen pp has been removed. We USEd a pp gen for the new pp.
Innocent - Mastermined_ 

I am NOT LYING ðŸ¤¥. WE MADE A NEW PP.

DO NOT DARE INTIMIDATE ANYONE WITH THIS EVIDENCE WE AKNOWLEDGE THAT WE ALLEDGEDLY STOLE ARTEMIS'S PP FOR THE OLD ONE. THE NEW &amp; REPLACED ONE IS NOT STOLEN. We even have the pp generator disclaimer.
Innocent - Mastermined_ + I don't have a right to remain silent. You are not Law enforcement. The first amendment protects me.
Mastermined_ - Innocent You forgot the 5th amendment, also do you live in US? Lmfao
Mastermined_ - Innocent The source of that pp was ZoidCloud, before the update, Luxxy had stayed in ZoidCloud, now you would yell "He was banned or he left", he knew the site urls of ZoidCloud. Not the discord message links. You are the one tempering with evidence because you are a dummy sent by Luxxy because Luxxy is afraid his host will be dead. I want to speak with Luxxy, not a dummy guy who is "admin" and is forced to talk on someoneâ€™s behalf.
Innocent - Mastermined_ Ah yes. I am a dummy. I am not a dummy.
Innocent - Mastermined_ "Stolen?" Right. Forget about the following sites then.

Mastermined_ - Innocent Nor I do care.
Mastermined_ - Innocent The Source was ZoidCloud
Mastermined_ - Nice try to dodging evidence, childish.
Mastermined_ - Mastermined_ also this. Answer.
Innocent - Mastermined_ I do not know the validity of your statement. But with even more evidence against your claim of the new pp being stolen &amp; that we definitely didn't use a free privacy policy generator is unsurprising.
Innocent - Mastermined_ Privacy policy generator stole the privacy policy of zoidcloud &amp; used it for their generator? You might as well as sue them.
Innocent - Mastermined_ Am I dodging evidence? Not really.
Innocent - Mastermined_ I can't believe how you made one of my friends resign from the hosting team.
Mastermined_ - Innocent the validity of my statement is clear, the source of copying is ZoidCloud's Privacy Policy. Also, you are still dodging evidence. Let me just explain what you are doing

First, you appeared in my DMs and I asked identify yourself, and your response was childish.

Second, you sent a image saying that Luxxy got DMCA'd and eventually, you deleted it. But luckily I have a screenshot, because of this you may have deleted more messages.

The message deletion:

The image deleted:


Third, you tried to put a robot's name over Luxxy to cover his stealing. Also, how is H3NRY? 

Fourth, deleted a post on drama.gg, more suspicious.

Fifth, childish actions, making a FAQ saying Mastermined to shut his mouth and posting a copied source of Privacy Policy from ZoidCloud.



Also, the final, not getting Luxxy to talk here. Seems he is afraid of me and he accepts that. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-05-12/1652392278-368344-e601ddfd-cd94-4e40-b318-a1b578b47968.jpg

Second, you sent a image saying that Luxxy got DMCA'd and eventually, you deleted it. But luckily I have a screenshot, because of this you may have deleted more messages.

The message deletion:

The image deleted:


Third, you tried to put a robot's name over Luxxy to cover his stealing. Also, how is H3NRY? 

Fourth, deleted a post on drama.gg, more suspicious.

Fifth, childish actions, making a FAQ saying Mastermined to shut his mouth and posting a copied source of Privacy Policy from ZoidCloud.



Also, the final, not getting Luxxy to talk here. Seems he is afraid of me and he accepts that. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-05-12/1652392461-852770-70778a89-9c3f-4c96-8fcc-4631ed116545.jpg

Innocent - Mastermined_ Damn. You exposed me. AM I dodging evidence? LOOK AT THE FUCKING PRIVACY POLICIES &amp; THE TEMPLATE MAKER. I HAD ENOUGH OF YOUR RAMBLES. It is time that I took my matters into my own hands. But yeah, he does look at the drama. I deleted the post to not drag my good friend into the convo. Thank you for making me realize these stuff. H3NRy is fine. TO be serious. H3nry has a username &amp; ID. 861546992478846996, H3NRY#3384.

Innocent - Mastermined_ 

To answer 1. Yes, I did do that. Just to see if you could Identify me.

I admit that I am part childish.
Mastermined_ - Innocent Wait a second, skid. You still dodgning evidence. Get some glasses if you have difficulties ðŸ˜‰ - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-05-12/1652394918-423335-2377379e-0372-4bcc-95d2-1b7c4537a473.jpg
Innocent - Mastermined_ Source was Zoidcloud. Did you forget about the fact that H3NRY wrote it?
Mastermined_ - Mastermined_ also this isnâ€™t answered, man you are not my level even to talk.
Innocent - Innocent HERE
Innocent - Mastermined_ Am I still dodging evidence? I acknowledge where you are coming from, but I must ask if you can acknowledge where I am coming from? thanks.
Mastermined_ - Innocent that doesnâ€™t answer anything, Luxxy owns the document, thats the main part, also why you join ing and leaving ArtiomsHosting just to try and contact me? Pathetic. Also, you deleted DMs.
Mastermined_ - Innocent I am from Spain.
Innocent - Mastermined_ 
I own the document.
I made it 3 days ago &amp; uploaded it for the pdf - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-05-12/1652395243-196275-image.png
Mastermined_ - Also, another fact of dodging evidence is the famous stealing Luxxy has done to source codes.
Innocent - Mastermined_ Okay.
Innocent - Mastermined_ I do not know about that part. That's currently offtopic. Artiom already told me.
Innocent - Mastermined_ - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-05-12/1652395428-408559-image.png
Mastermined_ - Artiom that isnâ€™t covered, also your "deleting" the privacy policy, isnt a thing since Luxxy got afraid after I DMCA'd and remove the stolen Privacy Policy. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-05-12/1652395497-613333-aaaf6c47-e739-4b6f-aef7-a1a868849858.png

Mastermined_ - Innocent "off topic" you are actually a retard. literally you said I was a legal department lmfao. You donâ€™t like me, when fuck off.
Innocent - Mastermined_ 
Ok "Legal Officer" ðŸ˜‡
Innocent - F
Mastermined_ - Innocent Ok "Retard" who says I am legal department and now knows that I am a Legal Officer.
Mastermined_ - Innocent Also, tell Luxxy, You arenâ€™t alone.
Innocent - Mastermined_ Ok ðŸ’€ . Just know that, since you didn't complete your Duolingo lessons, Duo will come after you.
Innocent - Mastermined_ Sure.
cyanide - The kid legit stole my privacy policy. He took Artioms and once he got in trouble for that, instead of fixing his mistake and making one himself, he took mine...
Innocent - cyanide thats luxxy
cyanide - Innocent ik
Innocent - Innocent 

cyanide ALSO. MY GOD. YOU HAVE NOT EVEN LOOKED AT THIS IMAGE? I am sincerely dissapointed.
cyanide - so why are u defending him?
Innocent - cyanide Because I have a server with him.
Innocent - cyanide + I don't get paid enough for this stuff.
cyanide - Innocent i worked as a dev for luxxy and didn't get paid shit. he made me code stuff for him and then stole the credits
Innocent - cyanide Im not sure what to choose anymore. Your hosting or his. I mean... He did give me more ram when I lost all my data...
cyanide - Innocent my hosting?
what does that have to do with anything?
cyanide - other than stolen documents
Innocent - Mastermined_ Huh. Got it.
Innocent - cyanide I just don't know. I mean, there is too much evidence defending luxxy for the new pp &amp; how he didn't steal yours. Like yeah. I guess you two don't get it, do you?
Innocent - Innocent But there is also so much against him for the old pp. That's acceptable, I guess.
FatGrizzly - 2 kids fighting about a generated pp, Great.
Atleast use termius.

and whytf do you have privacypolicy as a pdf in discord servers?
Mastermined_ - FatGrizzly That is correct, because they are lazy and canâ€™t put it on a site. Also, that was the reason I submitted DMCA since it was being hosted on Discord CDN.
Mastermined_ - The 2 kids are Luxxy and Innocent since they both are trying to cover themselves after they got exposed for what they have done and try to fight us.
Innocent - Mastermined_ 

Thinking about it. It would not be sustainable, since you could just request a takedown of the website.
Innocent - Mastermined_ I'm choosing to not be in this argument, but why are you still bringing me in? For your information I am being open about the Ã©xpose against me.
Mastermined_ - Innocent You are making it worse, if you delete the file, it will still be in the discord CDN, if you get it on the website, we could DMCA on website provider, and Discord CDN. Double DMCA's. And double copyright Infringement.
Mastermined_ - Innocent why you are here then, leave this community. I am not forcing you to post in here. But I guess you are saying this after you and luxxy are exposed and you canâ€™t do anything about it.
Mastermined_ - Also, with that message, you admit you are eligible to be DMCA'd since you are using a copied work. Nice. This is gonna be used against another DMCA claim against you. Thatâ€™s why you have the right to remain silent, because anything you say can be used against you or luxxy.
Dennis - he also stole James' DigitalOcean account &amp; sent him prn
Dennis - Artiom u are the least likely person in my dms to raid someone
XxMBGxX - FatGrizzly  lol true
XxMBGxX - Dennis lol wtff
DarkInk - ðŸ¤” I don't really care much but they gave credit for 3-4 days then I check a few hours ago and they removed it. I ask them about it and they insta ban my alt lmao
Mastermined_ - Second DMCA against copying ZoidCloud's ToS and Privacy Policy. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-05-18/1652884940-3025-bc6c0df4-ebe2-435e-9e93-4cbe6328dace.jpg
cyanide - Artiom extremely odd of you, saying you could learn to make self bots and such. I think it would be a tactical move to take out a competing host like LuxxyHosting to give the spotlight to ArtiomsHost. Just curious, it does sound like something you would do.
cyanide - I'm not trying to defend Luxxy, but Artiom is a shady character and I wouldn't put it past him to raid a competing host.
xD-UrDaD - So this images proof they use Digital Ocean

did if its abused or not but they Closed the ticket and Banned me on there server
for asking invoice
that seems to be sussy
so i am here

and i have one more point idk if its valid or not
Digi is much costly as compared to Contabo or Hetzner they why one will use Digi that also for free host - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-05-28/1653763359-91758-screenshot-2022-04-23-171518.png

Mastermined_ - xD-UrDaD may I know when you took those screenshots? Also, I think they proxy their hardware by DigitalOcean.
Mastermined_ - The definition of Proxy is, they open vpn tunnel by using OpenVPN or other client, then run iptables, after all of that you connect your VM to that VPN tunnel and route everything.
Mastermined_ - But, Luxxy, he is in the middle of another DMCA claim, cannot disclose anything else ðŸ™‚.
BhagwanXD - They are scammers abusing linode and digitalocean!
Innocent - Quick update.

Luxxy hosting is being DDosed, I wouldn't be surprised that it was someone who was reading through this thread.
FatGrizzly - Ok and? Why would someone from a random community ddos you? get some balls and mitigate the attack. No one(apart some kids) have any reason to ddos your shit.
Win - Quick Update

I do neither support Luxxy Hosting or am I in it but I do know that Luxxy does in-fact use digital ocean as a proxy, but he does abuse their free trial feature using virtual credit cards.
Innocent - Update

Digital ocean is used, the rest of the staff team doesnt know anything about virtual credit cards.
