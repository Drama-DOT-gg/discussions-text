DeletedUser19wxkn89s - First of all, I think they said they had a policy but they're currently re-doing it to make it more correct so that's not so bad.
Second, Contabo is not bad, but they anyway said they're moving to a dedicated server.
DeletedUser19wxkn89s - And it's not illegal in all states to not have a privacy policy.
Sloth - @Iceey
Mea - DeletedUser19wxkn89s contabo is ðŸ’© but ok
DeletedUser19wxkn89s - They're moving to a deli anyway
DeletedUser19wxkn89s - You guys keep judging without looking into it
They had a policy, but they're redoing it

I opened a support ticket about an error with my DB, and he helped me right away. He seems to know stuff
Tomas - Ah yes, moving to a deli. Love those sausages.
Deleted User - Oh here we go again? You starting more stuff with my other host?
Deleted User - Or what?  How about I talk shit about drama.gg?
Deleted User - And see what your guys think? You guys are just disrespectful.
Deleted User - Its hard for many hosts. And we just started and we are still learning and starting and we canâ€™t take this. You guys make many small/new hosts quit. And it stressful for them. As of what I think is that altas hosting has chnaged much. And you guys wonâ€™t stop us. We have so much to say about you guys . And alk you guys just talk shit and so much. How anout you talk crap about my host with a Tk domain and much more? Huh yea I havent see no report from it. All I want from you guys is respect and kindnice. Thats all I want from you guys. As our founder goes though so much. And you guys are just making it more hard.
