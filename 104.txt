Matteo - Uhm so i see a lotta people trashing on contabo, but contabo is not that bad of a host.
Matteo - only doesn't have dedos protecc
Endermined - No one's trashing contabo. They got an excellent price:performance ratio. What people are trashing is the hosts which use contabo due t contabo's low end hardware being pretty much unacceptable for the prices the server hosting companies are charging for their services. Your not going to pay $1/gb for a Minecraft server hosted on a 60GB contabo VPS for example.
Endermined - Contabo isn't a bad host at all. No one is saying that. The hosting companies using contabo to sell minecraft servers are bad Minecraft server hosts because the hardware is horrible for hosting a Minecraft server on. (And honestly it kinda shows the hosts are pretty cheap xD)
HCS - Hosting on a holo hosting VPS is worse
