Plactrix - I and one of my friends ordered colocation for a 1U server located in the UK paid for a price matched of $29 (paid yearly). They also they agreed to cover 50% of the shipping cost as it was pretty expensive shipping from Canada to UK aswell also to pay the twise debit card fees (which was 10$) so we paid 390$ on April 4th, 2021.
Note: before paying for the colocation the administrator agreed to offer a refund within 31 days if we were not satisfied with the service also while covering the return shipping fee. Do note that at this point we never really got the server fully setup since we were waiting for parts and we had to refund an nvme riser due to it being broken, but after we got it all working it was a while later and that was not what I was looking for so I raised a refund request on the 1st of May and to date which is 18 June 2021 we have not received a refund yet. The administrator had never ending excuses for not being refunded and a few of them are as follows


















The second part to this is when me and eraters ordered a dedicated server from System 413 for $70/mo ($35 Setup fee). We didn’t receive the dedi even after a week which was past the timeframe that was given to us, so we again raised a refund request which they said was okay. From what eraters told me, they showed the proof that CPU was what was holding up the order along with proof of it. Then eraters said it was fine but then, as usual, we still receive it. We once again, we forwarded the refund request but they said they wont be refunding the setup fee which we said was fine even though we didn’t receive it in the first place. I would also like to add in 2 things, for both transactions (colocation and the dedi), I paid with transfer wise, and for the dedi payment, at first I was given a UK payment page which didn’t work as my card is a US card, so we moved on to transferwise, which we probably tried 3 or 4 of the administrator and System 413’s bank accounts to get the payment to go through.

Plactrix - I and one of my friends ordered colocation for a 1U server located in the UK paid for a price matched of $29 (paid yearly). They also they agreed to cover 50% of the shipping cost as it was pretty expensive shipping from Canada to UK aswell also to pay the twise debit card fees (which was 10$) so we paid 390$ on April 4th, 2021.
Note: before paying for the colocation the administrator agreed to offer a refund within 31 days if we were not satisfied with the service also while covering the return shipping fee. Do note that at this point we never really got the server fully setup since we were waiting for parts and we had to refund an nvme riser due to it being broken, but after we got it all working it was a while later and that was not what I was looking for so I raised a refund request on the 1st of May and to date which is 18 June 2021 we have not received a refund yet.

NighMayHigh - Hi,

We do not dispute, or deny the fact that you are owed, and will receive a refund.

As you are aware, there have been countless issues, due to a certain person ahem not sending the refund.

We have now arranged terms for this refund to be issued within 2 days, and i apologies on behalf of the company for this shortcoming.

Please do not hesitate to contact me, if anyone has any questions, and i will work to resolve the issues swiftly.

Thank You,
Ellis W
Lucas - confirm this
Plactrix - NighMayHigh It’s been 9 days and I haven’t gotten anything yet
Plactrix - On the 23rd I was told they could refund me $100 and the rest would be refunded next week
I waited for the $100 to be sent
 nothing - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-27/1624753671-232794-48bd1883-01f4-4769-8c9b-04bc2c244b08.png

SidisLiveYT - Kind of a Fishy Business!
Confirmed this , its been already many days and no refund at all 
@Plactrix They are toying you around I guess
Ryder - Confirm this yeah, once the refund is received by plactrix then change it to resolved or something
NighMayHigh - Hi All,

@Plactrix We have already agreed to refund you, you were sent 100$ yesterday, with the rest to likely follow later this week, as you are aware, we are having cashflow problems due to the sheer amount of refunds requested, and additionally due to the fact that we have dealt with a ex director siphoning money from ourselves, and a massive £5000 loss last month due a client signing up for a lot of services, and then defaulting on them.

You will be refunded, as i have made clear.

Now, @J0SH You arent actually due any compensation, we offered you a dedi free for a month as a goodwill gesture, doing so at this stage would cause further harm to our business, so we are unable to deliver that as ofpresent

Thank you,
NighMayHigh - Hi,

Id like to add some clarity,

We have now made arrangements to refund both 
@Plactrix and Eraters, plactrix will update here once refund is recieved.
Mitchell - their support also sucks
Plactrix - $100 has been received, I was told I would get another $150 or $200 next week
Plactrix - I've pretty much completely given up on this
I doubt Nigh's ever going to refund me
IoNetty - Plactrix BogNodes also didn't get a quick delivery, there waiting on a refund.
Wiktor - IoNetty not only did it take him a week to say that he has it in stock, He was making endless excuses and when i ask for s refund he supposibly had them back in stock and he gave them to other people, when i requested  a refund i asked him for proof,he said the guy does not have discord and he only has phone which is bullshit cause in the screenshot where nigh asks for the 390 dollar redund its clear that he does have discord
FatGrizzly - @Plactrix 
Nigh has told that he has refunded your money, can you confirm? - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-22/1629643734-224263-image.png

Can you confirm? - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-22/1629643747-159768-image.png
NighMayHigh - Plactrix Hello,

Apologies, totally forgot to notify you that we sent you the rest. The remaining amount was sent to you on Friday, via wire transfer.

Any issues just let me know 🙂
NighMayHigh - Wiktor  Let me clarify the facts for you here

You ordered your service, which was pending due to a fraud check, once we had conducted this, and verified your information we submitted the order for delivery, which failed due to lack of stock.

You were made aware of this, and we told you that we would get you your server by the 20th august.

You requested to cancel because i was 'unresponsive', even though you were aware that at the time i was on annual leave, and our response time was under 24hours,  we honoured this request, and said that your refund has been requested, and once the relevant person picks it up, it'll be issued. To which you began insulting myself, my company, and my staff, both in DMs, and in our, and drama.gg's discord. I do not understand the reason for this, but you complain that we refund you as soon as we get stock, this was your request, we were prepared, and were more than able to deliver the order by the quoted time, however you continued complaining. 

In all honesty, i dont understand what you want from us, you asked for a refund, we agreed to provide it and have begun taking steps to issue it, so what is the issue here?

BrendansAtWork - @Wiktor you really looking like a clown here lmao
Wiktor - NighMayHigh the issue here is that you said that u will get it done before the 20th, On the 19th when i asked you did you get it done or anything like that but instead you chose to ignore me and didn’t  reply for the rest of the day, The second issue here is that the second i ask for a refund you say that youre  back in stock but you gave me no responses what so ever, If you warned me and chose not to ignore me, or If you got better staff to take care of it while you were gone then there would be no issue
IoNetty - BrendansAtWork nigh is on holiday, i'll be in nigh's position. he was busy enjoying his life until someone started bombing him for a refund.
Plactrix - FatGrizzly he said the rest was sent, the eta is Wednesday
ill post an update when I get it
NighMayHigh - Wiktor 

No, the issue is that yku are still complaining even though you got what yku asked for.

You asked for a refund, as such we requested a refund to be sent to you, you can't try to pin it on us and blame us for getting servers in stock?

Additionally your argument about me ignoring you is pretty invalid, you were well aware of the new setup date, along with the reasons for the delay and the fast that I was on annual leave. Your longest response from us was like 18 hours which is pretty decent all things considered, especially as you know that we don't make a single penny on the specific vps plan you ordered due to the high costs of servers.
FatGrizzly - NighMayHigh did the wire transfer fail nigh?

abdullah - Alright so I usually don't write drama.gg posts because they're useless, but I really don't like scammers. Background is that I bought a Ryzen 7 3700X with 1 year of power-on time and a B450 motherboard for $150 from one of their used hardware sales. After I paid it by credit card, he basically stopped responding in DMs so I opened a ticket, where he still didn't respond. The date right now is 27th August, 2021, and I haven't received any CPU or motherboard at either address provided. He also agrees into a refund later on (which was never issued, and no screenshots were provided for anything) implying that he knew that the CPU was never sent. Anyways, I don't want to influence you too much, here is our conversation and proof of payment:

After I paid it by credit card, he basically stopped responding in DMs so I opened a ticket, where he still didn't respond. The date right now is 27th August, 2021, and I haven't received any CPU or motherboard at either address provided. He also agrees into a refund later on (which was never issued, and no screenshots were provided for anything) implying that he knew that the CPU was never sent. Anyways, I don't want to influence you too much, here is our conversation and proof of payment:










I've blurred the addresses for obvious reasons.

@NighMayHigh Just stop scamming people for their money, people work so hard for every dollar, and not for you to steal it... - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-27/1630076587-686439-discord-uquj2xfwqs.png

Ryan - @NighMayHigh now this is just really messedup
RumGuru - I thought System413 was a good host, i changed my mind after hearing all this....
Robert - Someone also wanted me to add this to the thread - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-27/1630079229-570538-afbeelding.png
Wiktor - NighMayHigh the thing is, THAT THERE IS NO ISSUE i literally just want a refund holy shit thats all im asking fir i dont want your services you took too long just give me a refund or im charging back and yhr review is going back on trust pilot
Chirag - Robert probably sarcasm
NighMayHigh - @abdullah Your refund was issued on the 10th July, less than a week after you made me aware of the issue. You also claimed that you already charged back and got a refund, whats the issue?

Proof is below

Robert - NighMayHigh You might want to fix this - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-27/1630082146-310736-afbeelding.png
NighMayHigh - Apologies, try https://gyazo.com/aa6563cec3c0d4ccbd22d60ad1b92d53
NighMayHigh - Wiktor Hello, are you still waiting for this?, drop me a email, ellis@413.io and ill get this sorted for you
NighMayHigh - Robert Was sarcasm, but eh.
Two - NighMayHigh amazing way to treat customers? am i right? (no, dont joke or do scarasm with customers. thats a bad business practice)
abdullah - NighMayHigh Strange, maybe your provider hasn't refunded it yet? But from what you're showing, it said you refunded 3 weeks ago so it's strange I never got it. I attached a video of the bank statement for July and August.
