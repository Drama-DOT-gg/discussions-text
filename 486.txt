Logisch_JoJo - Atleast you agree your mistakes and create an own thread for it… I guess that you are really sorry for your mistakes… Does someone bought the "stolen" reselled theme?
Daftscientist - I'm QUITE sure you knew it was from PteroDev since your in our server...
Ryan - Logisch_JoJo no , no one bought it
Ryan - Daftscientist yes i did as mentioned above
MysteriousK69 - Ryan You might as well want to mention that you are underage to be running a business.
EyezWatcher - MysteriousK69 and what? He probably has parent cosent but it isn't your problem.
Daftscientist - EyezWatcher well if he is handling money it's ilegal I think, idk I'm not a lawyer
MysteriousK69 - EyezWatcher I don't know about parental consent, but he did mention him being 13, and making PayPal accounts to handle money, which got limited. He could not verify the accounts identity, because he used fake documents. No reason to do so if he had parental consent.
MysteriousK69 - MysteriousK69 Even if his parents consent, I am pretty sure its legal. Not sure about the laws of whatever country he lives in though.
Ryan - MysteriousK69 i am under age 

and money is managed by parents i tell them what to buy and when to buy and they do it
