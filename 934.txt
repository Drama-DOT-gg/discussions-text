Xmomoo - So today i was in the discord in peace, until i got a dm advertising like always from a host owner, i went through this host and they are running without tos or pp and with freenom domain

when i said to him that dm advertising will lead to ban from other servers, he deleted the message and acted like he didnt do anything


then i told him that drama.gg wont be friendly with his host because he running with freenom and without legal docs, he acted like he don't know what i am talking about


then for the third time i asked for legal, he said they have it, then when i said i wanna see it he said i am not a client - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-29/1630203455-186063-img-20210829-041615.jpg

Xmomoo - this is a proof for the freenom domain - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-29/1630203896-97644-img-20210829-041037.jpg
IoNetty - Xmomoo they were in pterodactyl discord asking for help with everything, fair. everyone needs help but sometimes not with everything. also i have a video to offend him
IoNetty - https://you-should.gimme-your.money/‚Å†‚Äã‚Äç‚Äå‚Äã‚Å†‚Äå‚Äå‚Å†‚Äç‚Äã.mp4 dw, it's not embeding. just click it and watch it. if your scared of an ip logger use a vpn
AxelNetwork - IoNetty I will not give you my money smh
Cravox - IoNetty wow nice grabify bro, I vpned it for you üôÇ
dchu096 - bruh i just notice voltagehosting dont even have a homepage...?



Their main page is ptero........

But wow how can they have a plugin but no proper domain. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-29/1630280518-594416-chrome-b1j7b4fu7b.png
comfyy - dchu096 nulled
Xmomoo - dchu096 nor client
Cravox - comfyy what is nulled? Our $20 billing system? our $15 login system? or our theme that we made??
dchu096 - Cravox Hello. you said you paid 15 dollar for login. Can you state the plugin name? and whoever made it? and your payment informations (e.g. paypal?). Nulled means its cracked and got it for free
dchu096 - A .tk domain is a free domain from freenom... If you can put 15 dollars into a plugin a simple namecheap .net is like 9 dollars and you cant afford it...?



I dont believe it. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-09-05/1630807050-828752-chrome-ucqyscszax.png
