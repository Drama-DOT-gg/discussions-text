Deleted User - They use AWS as their nodes LOL


They opened like 2 months ago... The trial is for 1 year
He uses the free epic games discord nitro
His youtube channel has a tutorial with how to install a modded apk for among us
All the nodes are from the same provider - AWS

NighMayHigh - Nothing is inherently bad with AWS though, they are a solid cloud provider?
HarryW - NighMayHigh  Yes but itâ€™s probably the AWS free trial.
Jedrik - HarryW I mean we can't just say it's probably the AWS free trial
BaconHead - Jedrik AWS is pretty expensive, and this is free hosting so how do you think that they'll get the money for buying from AWS? Free hosting services don't earn much and most likely cannot pay the exorbitant prices of AWS
Justin - mituishere No hate towards AWS, their cloud services are great. AWS delivers great hosting experience, tbh i use it for most of my school project these days.
Deleted User - Justin The point is that they're using a free trial from AWS for a minecraft free host. 

They also just had a data loss: - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-23/1627030548-538879-captura-de-ecran-din-2021-07-23-la-115546.png
Justin - mituishere Well, that could be of any reason, i'm not protecting any shit hosting, but i mean.. Honestly. This could be due to many reasons, most probably aws trails, but i ain't pulling on loose strings here.
Deleted User - Justin But still, why did he open a free host with AWS free trial? If he knew that he doesn't have enough money to buy a real node, then he should just not open a minecraft hosting
Ryder - mituishere so he can get some money from arc lol
Deleted User - Ryder Nah, he also haves a paid hosting, I don't think that he knows what arc is.
The point is that no one needs to use his hosting services because who knows what can happen with their files.
Ryder - probably just to sell data later /shrug
Justin - Ryder AmEn
Deleted User - Ryder after 2h: BLACKSPIGOT FREE SERVER FILES JUSTINCH

He mostly just wanted to join the free hosting "trend"
RTKDMme - mituishere he had arc
Jastin - mituishere I just don't have everyone's bakcup file. so how am I going to sell it whereas I don't have his file
Deleted User - Jastin It was a meme from another guy who had a host.
Why wouldn't you do backups of the files...?
