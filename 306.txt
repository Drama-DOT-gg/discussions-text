TheOfficialAce - I am tired of people making stupid threads about company's that don't have a right Terms of service or Private Policy. If they have a issue on it can't you just report it to the owner and they can fix it. Your basically hurting someones company which you don't need to hurt. This is just a request...  A example is DijixCloud. There a really good company and they make there things fully custom.
