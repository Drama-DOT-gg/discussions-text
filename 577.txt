L4db - Hello, my friends, and i am back with a hot (what i mean hot is like a hot potato) and new story, it is all about JavaCraft Hosting

There was a time that their "Self-hosted Dedicated Server" is burned down by a neighbor house, and the servers are down, website is down and the owner is always offline after the news.
Learn More:

 
When i go through the chat channel, i realized that JC Hosting does not have offsite backup! (and it is paid thus it must be included!)
(they said they will try to backup the server files, but how? how? you will recover the burned drives? bruh, this means you don't have any offsite backup before!)
Learn More:



and one thing, after the incident JavaCraft (the owner) just went offline for hours or days, and came back because they have brownout or something.

man, imagine you are the owner of the hosting, and you don't have any backups, and the server is burned down, who will you suppose to blame? the fire? 
NO dumbass, its your responsibility to protect the server and also the files of your customer.

This all means that this hosting is just money-grabber, why?
Lack of Management
Lack of Plan B in case of every incident
Affordable yet but lack or NO QoS or Quality of Service, if you finished paid the owner, the server is yours but we don't manage them nor protect them, its all yours, it your responsibility if fire burned your server.
  
Any words of wisdom or thoughts? - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-28/1622218327-712528-image.png

BabyAces - Umm. there is a issue here cause I am the one who owns JavaCraft.best which was a hosting company..
L4db - BabyAces okay then, where is the backups? It should be provided after the incident..
If no backups shown or if they say, they will backup first the burned drives, aba eh naglolokohan lang tayo dito (we are fooling ourselves here)
mtt - L4db what he means is, JavaCraft hosting already existed and they just took the name of his old host to make their host. BabyAces is not the guy in the actual javacraft
L4db - did you know, that this hosting, does not have any Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions.
Sydney - That grammar hurts my soul.... Not from the poster, but the announcement made by the owner.
Yie - Sydney yep
KylePlays - L4db 

But, HMMMMMMM I think I know you :&gt;

TheLegit - KylePlays umm no
KylePlays - TheLegit 

You did.. But it's fineee
KylePlays - TheLegit 

It was new because.. We just registered as a business on TrustPilot like 16 days ago?

That's when we are getting the .xyz domain and registered on TrustPilot ‚ò∫Ô∏è
TheLegit - KylePlays Yes, I know since that is normal but you already have a 1 star review lol
KylePlays - TheLegit 

That is James, He didn't buy a server to test Polarnodes tho
L4db - Javacraft has been gone.. truly this hosting is pure bullshit, and the owner just ran away.
L4db - Idk if this is true or theory, but Enfernee said that maybe they're using linode for their servers, and it is suspended, due to they're using trial, not burned. hmmmm
TheLegit - L4db Well, we can try to search the IP's of the server to see If they're using linode or not
KylePlays - TheLegit 

I can test the IP's but there's one thing, There's no IP has given to me to test on GeoIP Databases...
TheLegit - KylePlays Hello, please dm me the IP
KylePlays - TheLegit Wala nga akong IP para ma test ko kung Linode talaga ; - ;
TheLegit - KylePlays ok lang
TheLegit - Imagine making a scene when you said that the SSD's are burned and are still recovering when you are literally using a free trial and the free trial expired lol

@everyone  First of all, to all our Client's that didn't get any response from us, there's a reason why we don't give you an answer, we know we need to keep updated our Client's about their servers, 

the reason why we chose to don't give you any responses this might be caused by a short of time,

We've been monitoring what people might say about us!.

Now I think this is the right time to give a response to our Client that their backup world didn't go pretty well to recover,

we've seen a Meme this past moment, This post from Kyle 
we don't need to show her private identity, of course

Now here's the meme he released about us!

We used Azure! And Linode free Service? 

KyleNyoPagodNa#0111/KylePlays

The Ans is False! we didn't use any free service,

Then why is the IP located in Linode and Azure?

Here's the thing we tried to use the Linode service for Business partnership!

Now for the Azure!, 

We used Azure service for the reason of applying their network system using the Microsoft Server 2019 Web Service and Testing their System Using that OS ( Operating system ) 

Then why PojavCraft IP Leaked to that Company,
Here is the answer; first of all, Due to the Overloaded system we have and over node usage we used in SG, we have to use Azure Product to work their Server due to,
its been four months ago since the pojavcraft  opened,

then the IP/DNS you've been pointing out were Already pinned out last four months ago
JavaCraftHosting How about the Server We've paid for and the backup?

There's an update about the Drive we've tried to recover. The SSD Drive Back up is Fully recovered, 

But bad news for other clients we cannot successfully recover your data, and we were sorry about that,

List of Complete World Backup 
" Trek World "
" Kidzania " 
" Crafter's Hangout SMP "
" EPH-World " 
" Tulo Laway 5S "
" PojavCraft "

" Crafter's PE " 
" NemoCraft / May 2 "
Dear
" XION " "KIMPLAYZ " "BastaPangalan" "Sinichi" "JoshuaPH" " PrincePines "

Please accept my deepest apologies for my mistake regarding Lost Backup world and for not responding.

It was not my intention to create such an awkward and embarrassing situation for all of my clients.
If there was any good that came out of this unfortunate experience, I have grown and learned alternative approaches to these situations.
Please feel free to let me know your thoughts and concerns over this matter. You can reach me at Discord " ÍßÅJavaCraftÍßÇ#7559 " 
Sincerely,
JavaCraft
L4db - remember:
No Privacy Policy
No Terms and Conditions
No Website
No Offsite Backups
J0SH - Firstly, offsite backups are not required, the only thing that is valid there is the privacy policy. The terms of service is not legally required, nor is the website.
KylePlays - J0SH Did qh sold?
L4db - J0SH oh really offsite backups are not required, so it is our (Customers and Sponsors) fault that we lost our files on fire? 

bro this hosting is a paid service, backups are required (WE PAY FOR THEM AND THIER SERVICE), this is not a some free junk hosting
L4db - Javacraft keeps deleting their chat channels lmao

TheLegit - Amazing nulled whmcs! - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-01/1627784719-102277-image.png
mikee - TheLegit 

Baka dahil behind siya ng Cloudflare.

Pero pag palagay na natin na invested siya sa legit WHMCS, which is napakamahal, at $3 lang ung hosting niya.
Kailangan niya ng 6 to 7 clients para mabawi ung WHMCS palang.

Tapos sa 6-7 clients na yan, kailangan niya ng 16gb ram na allocation.

Sobrang lugi yang $3 niya. 

Ingat ingat. Malamang trial palang WHMCS nya at malalaman natin next month kung mamamatay o hindi.

Hindi lang yun. 
Meron pa syang:
Panel: 51.79.134.230
cPanel: 139.162.29.82
Kowone - mikee can't you fucking speak english?
AxelNetwork - Kowone 
Here's the translation:

Maybe it's behind in Cloudflare

But I think he actually invested in WHMCS, Which is the most expensive, And his hosting is only 3$
He needs 6-7 clients, And needs 16 GB of ram for allocation

He will lose money on his 3$ Hosting. 

(This is Filipino language and I am Filipino so yeah üáµüá≠)

TheLegit - mikee mag-english ka nalang xD iiyak na sila oh
Jen - I don't think a datacenter in singapore is going to shutdown due to a fire next door, That's not a very common practice nor do datacenters do that in singapore. I've experienced having many servers in that country. They only do such thing if the fire isn't controlled then the datacenters will take the racks and move them to be safe.
TheLegit - Jen It was discovered they faked it and were using free trials like digitalocean and linode.
