FatGrizzly - lemme guess, Rian is an indian kid?
SamCoThePug - Pretty sure, his english is fucked up lol
SamCoThePug - He also owns a host which abuses as seen in the image below: - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-03-25/1648221275-573253-image.png
SamCoThePug -  - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-03-25/1648221406-603163-image.png
FatGrizzly - mind putting up a warning before posting such derogatory language you both?
SamCoThePug - RianOP I actually never deleted a message of it, im not scared for people to see what i say lol - But you delete most messages of you being racist however
RianOP - This thread is useless tbh, you have worked with Plex on multiple hosts which abused
SamCoThePug - RianOP Its not useless, You ddosed my servers so you will pay for it. Also, i no longer work at plex host or anything lol
SamCoThePug - Prajwal Because i want to get this [REDACTED] fucked up, hes legit committing crimes by ddosing my server lad - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-03-25/1648221688-500619-image.png
Prajwal - SamCoThePug yea plexed is badsk he is hitting him off 
Cuz plexed have hitted rian alot lol so he is taking revenge 
And u think he is hitting  u off woof
SamCoThePug - Also how comes you are dodging my statement about your abused nodes? You can clearly see them on securitytrails https://securitytrails.com/list/apex_domain/metricnodes.net
SamCoThePug - Prajwal Oh he is hitting my server off too
SamCoThePug - No matter who its hitting, ddos is still illegal
RianOP - SamCoThePug You ALSO committed crimes by making a Heliactyl or Dashactyl crasher.
Let's not talk about all the times you DDoSed FoxyNodes dashboard using it.
Kowone - SamCoThePug man really thought that he has the power to take down drama.gg when he can't even pay for even a damn cent
RianOP - Kowone I never said I want to take down drama.gg, how do you think I paid for all my hosts huh?
SamCoThePug -  - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-03-25/1648221876-784174-image.png
SamCoThePug - RianOP I didnt, thats plex that did that
SamCoThePug - Kowone Ikr lol
Robert - Both of you, don't use the n- or r-word and read https://drama.gg/d/1845-rules-and-information
SamCoThePug - RianOP Oh you did say that - 

"And how do you think i pay for all my hosts" - You abuse DigitalOcean and GCP - I legit provided proof in this thread. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-03-25/1648221926-995977-image.png
Kowone - RianOP how do you think I paid for all my hosts huh?

you don't?
SamCoThePug - Robert Never posted abt the n bomb on the forum, it may be in screenshots of the discords chats tho.
SamCoThePug - I'll blur it out in future screenshots for the sake of sanity
SugarCandy - SamCoThePug whats the purpose for this thread
SamCoThePug - SugarCandy To expose Rian for ddosing - which is committing a crime
FatGrizzly - @RianOP oh crybaby, your momma's credit card is crying out there, trust me, Paid booters are shit and stop ddosing before someone files a complaint.

@SamCoThePug either cope with the ddos's or get a nice config for nginx, or even better move to ols/lsws
SugarCandy - SamCoThePug u also ddosed them some months ago ik
SamCoThePug - FatGrizzly As he hits from google cloud, i can see by logs - i just blocked gcp ASN in the path firewall
SugarCandy - yall are both skids
SamCoThePug - SugarCandy No? If they got hit then it was plex not me ðŸ¤£
SugarCandy - SamCoThePug u made the crashers, i am pretty sure
SugarCandy - also ur host also abused so
SamCoThePug - SugarCandy I may have made the code using the exploits plex said - but i gave him the code for them and never used them myself - making code isnt bad but using it wrongly is
SamCoThePug - SugarCandy I DONT OWN A HOST MATE
SamCoThePug - SamCoThePug Nor do i work for one either ðŸ˜›
SugarCandy - SamCoThePug u already know plex is badsk, he would ofc use it for harm
Loser - bruh he has op in his name ðŸ’€
SamCoThePug - SugarCandy I know he is badsk - Quite frankly, i dont care what he uses it for - if i get paid to make something then ill make it
SamCoThePug - @Robert can u lock the thread btw
Loser - SamCoThePug o
SugarCandy - SamCoThePug deleting is better option
SamCoThePug - SugarCandy Nah - i want everyone to see what he has done - he has been a hindrance the past few months
SamCoThePug - Here is the full chat https://chat-export-rianop.pages.dev/Chat%20Export - Discression is advised - there is racist stuff there
SamCoThePug -  - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-03-25/1648223172-312180-image.png
SugarCandy - SamCoThePug you both used very bad words, i would not recommend to paste this in drama.gg
SamCoThePug - SugarCandy Can you not see - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-03-25/1648223217-651525-image.png
