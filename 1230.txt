RealOreo nodes offline too yikers.

First of all Vanquish, we are not a host, and I don't know what you're saying is offline? Yes the VonexNode websites are down as that host is not up yet due to a series of challenges. 


And this one? No of course it is not up as I did not have time to make it today?


And this one? As said before the Powelt website is still not done.

Again we're not a host, we're a group. And yes, the logo was from a free logo creator, just because I can't design logos, does that mean that I cannot make a good thing?


Sorry Vanquish, but you're coming in here being a complete dick and questioning everything without reason, telling me that it's stupid what I chose. I chose what I chose and thats how it is?

So this thread is complete bullshit, sorry to say. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-11-21/1637461108-43639-image.png

Oliver1234dotdot - I don't know what you have against me, but please stop the bullshit. I did literally NOTHING wrong, and I get a thread suddenly?
Lucas - Oliver1234dotdot first of all, I asked Oreo to make this thread for me I didnâ€™t want to have to make an account again. This thread does have a purpose, I literally asked you two questions that had no toxicity or disrespect implied and you bursted out with a rude attitude and whatnot. You told another member that was "â€œdefending" you that youâ€™re too busy to show him the rules because youâ€™re playing roblox yet you claim to be a business or whatever. I have nothing against you personally but I highly recommend you get your act together and quit acting like a fool.
Oliver1234dotdot - Anyways, you can DM me if you want any further conversation, I will not be answering here anymore.
Lucas - you completely ignored my main two arguments aswell maybe read the full thread
Ples - ur busy playing roblox LMFAO ðŸ¤£
Lucas - Oliver1234dotdot okay, all good. but this is going to stay up for anyone to comment on.
Lucas - he left the drama.gg discord
Ples - Lucas his to busy playing roblox, remember.
Lucas - Ples man grinds roblox heâ€™s too dangerous to be kept alive
Lucas - to be clear, Iâ€™m gonna be deleting my account on here however itâ€™s by my choice and not a result of any rule violation or connected to this thread at all.
SirCat - Lucas Yes lmfao, ive known oliver for a short while he was with plexed, and i almost convinced plexed to actually get rid of him until i exposed plexed.
