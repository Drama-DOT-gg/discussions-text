xxLandiPlayz - Heya,

I was in a dev team, Ash being the owner, you might have heard of him.
Me and a friend have decided to make a bot based around a character. 
While doing some preparation work for it thru conversation it came up to Ash that we are making the bot, he decides that he will buy a domain to irritate me. He buys a domain "paimon.xyz", keep in mind he already knew we didn't decide for a domain yet.
Afterwards he puts it that he wanted to let me use the domain, we asked him how and his reply was that he wouldn't transfer it, but that he would let me link it to a DNS of choice and use it, Sounds sketchy doesn't it.
A few days go by and we decided on a different domain "paibot.me".
After telling Ash he is like I am going to make the same bot as you...?
He told my friend that it was his idea for the bot, not knowing that that exact friend of mine is making the bot with me.

Ash has done a lot of stupid stuff in the past, but this is where I decided to cut contact with him completely.

Ash is also planning to sell the bot, Making money, and not caring about the character.
Me and my friend are making the bot because we care about the character, and plan to make all features free.

Here is all proof for everything: (9 screenshots in order) - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-10-08/1602146312-456211-ash1.png

HCS - Ash is scum and did nuke a server but there
is already a thread
AYS - You can't get verified dev right now
eraters - yeah but hopefully it re-opens
Ash - xxLandiPlayz lmao g u said go fuck off with ur domain idc what u do then i decded to make a bot i was never informed that ur bot was "paibot.me" i thought yoy had decided on a new name.
Ash - Also you blocked me first so dont act that i blocked is big lmao
Ash -  - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-10-08/1602175801-566096-image.png
Ash - meaning i can do anything u never told me that u where using paimon
Ash - I changed here - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-10-08/1602176037-741893-image.png
Ash - deleted
Ash - Where i was told he bought paibot.me - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-10-08/1602176115-771049-image.png
Ash - i had decided 3 hours before to use paimon as bot as he told me he did not want
Ash - how tf did i scam u???
Ash - lmao get me proof where i "scammed " you as marked on the psot
xxLandiPlayz - Ash 
U weren't informed that we were going to use "paibot.me" but you were informed that the domain was undecided.

I never said that You have blocked me first, the 5th screenshot already implies that I have blocked you first.
The screenshot that you provided is already included in the proof I sent. Did you even read the hoax fully?

 meaning I can do anything u never told me that u where using paimon

I'm not sure what do you mean by that, If you mean that u never knew we were using the name "Paimon" for the bot... Really, we have told you the name of the bot a few times, and you did buy paimon.xyz because you wanted to irritate me so you are telling people by yourself that you knew the name of the bot.
xxLandiPlayz - Ash 
You know that u were going to let us use it if we decided for it or if not that you were going to sell it.
You never came up with the idea for the Paimon Bot, I even have proof that it was my idea if you would add me back to the AshBot Dev Team.
Ash - tf is ur point
Ash - i dont have an hour to read ur essay
Tomas - Ash takes 10 minutes to read all of this, Landi seems to have a strong point here.
xxLandiPlayz - Ash As Tomas said it takes like 10 minutes to read.
You also know what you have done so you don't even have to read it.
eraters - Also, in those screenshots, it shows that you blocked him first, as his do not show up as __ blocked messages.
Ash - A few days go by and we decided on a different domain "paibot.me" it was 1 day lmao
Jedrik - Ash 

Ash tf is ur point

^^^ right back at ya
Ash - Jedrik ?
eraters - yeah im with that last post right there - pretty sure jedrik is drunk again
Ash - bro ur accused me on spamming the server with 2 bots are u dumb i dont know how to use an egg
Ash - oh fuck read it wrong
xxLandiPlayz - Ash I didn't remember and since I have already deleted you from my dms, I couldn't check. Now that you say it, you are right, I think it was one day. But how does that change anything in any way?
Ash - ASXHZ RETURN MESSAGE

Point:"I stole his idea"
Resposne: First of all the idea of making the bot was a joke mainly to piss him of cause he was like bullling me lmao and you did not come up with paimon or the bot i dea you actually coped smeone else :D
mtt - LMAO
Ash - also landi if you join the offical paimon like game serve rof where its from theres a paimon bot so ;-------------;
xxLandiPlayz - Ash If it was mainly to piss me off you should have probably said so in the 2 times we have messaged since you did that, and your last message should not have been "Fuck you never message me again".
Yes there is a few Paimon Bots out there, as yiu said but no Paimon Bots were public until a few days ago. If we both came up with the idea separately I wouldnt have a problem, But you clearly did it to piss me off and you got the idea by seeing my message in the AshBit Devs group.
Ash - lmao u spammed paimon 24/7
Ash - lmao u spammed paimon 24/7
xxLandiPlayz - Im not sure what do you mean by that, I said that I am making it once in the group.
Flax and I sending anime gifs is nothing out of the usual, if you mean that, we did it with a lot of characters.
xxLandiPlayz - Ash Im also not sure how does that in any way relate to what I said in the message you replied to
Jedrik - Resolved by eraters and Ash
