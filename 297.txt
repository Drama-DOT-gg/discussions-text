Toki0179 - Uh oh, another scammer!

First of all I did not do all of this on my own @tlkh40salt helped me find with this.

anyways lets get into the sauce!
This was the person we found advertising the sale of a cheap dedi server and so tlkh40 decided to dm him asking about it and got told to dm paq


"ip does not exist now" keep this in mind because this is important!


He claimed he was a partner with oneprovider and then deleted the message because he decided that he wasn't anymore


Here is the screenshot of him deciding to backtrack


He tried to stop us from seeing where the dedi came from


He ended up giving it and when 
we decided to look on whois we saw that the dedi was from contabo that which was slightly disappointing as I was expecting an ip from oneprovider. ip blurred due to contabos lack of ddos protection.


Just so it is more clear for the readers here is the proof its from contabo I have blurred out the ip because you know contabos ddos protection is not good at all!


I don't know much about these people but apparently he just doesn't have oneprovider dedis


The next screenshot was the ip of that dedi and yes it did come from upcloud so I'll give him that. 

Here is when it starts getting saucier! Because we asked for his paypal email so we could "buy" the dedi and it turns out he is from HostHorizon [https://winterhoax.com/d/127-host-horizon-scamming](https://) which has a nice post already!


Not sure how this is a good marketing strategy at all because he is losing quite a lot of money by selling lifetime dedis for a onetime payment of 22 euros definitely when the specs of the dedi are: 128GB RAM DDR4 AMD EPYC 7520p 32 Cores


I swear it just keeps getting worse and worse though because their website doesn't really exist


and to make it 10x worse. Me asking if they have a privacy policy and then him replying "no we are privacy fans" this got me laughing so hard I almost fell out of my chair!


You know what is even funnier? the fact that even the co owner (or as it says in the server "pending executive") in paqet discord server agreed that paq is a shady guy


just some proof that he is the ""pending executive"


Anyway, thats the story of paqet being a potential scam i'm not 100% sure if it is but I personally believe it is an exit scam so please be careful if you are thinking of trying to purchase from him - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-01-21/1611247368-660795-image.png

Here is when it starts getting saucier! Because we asked for his paypal email so we could "buy" the dedi and it turns out he is from HostHorizon [https://winterhoax.com/d/127-host-horizon-scamming](https://) which has a nice post already!


Not sure how this is a good marketing strategy at all because he is losing quite a lot of money by selling lifetime dedis for a onetime payment of 22 euros definitely when the specs of the dedi are: 128GB RAM DDR4 AMD EPYC 7520p 32 Cores


I swear it just keeps getting worse and worse though because their website doesn't really exist


and to make it 10x worse. Me asking if they have a privacy policy and then him replying "no we are privacy fans" this got me laughing so hard I almost fell out of my chair!


You know what is even funnier? the fact that even the co owner (or as it says in the server "pending executive") in paqet discord server agreed that paq is a shady guy


just some proof that he is the ""pending executive"


Anyway, thats the story of paqet being a potential scam i'm not 100% sure if it is but I personally believe it is an exit scam so please be careful if you are thinking of trying to purchase from him - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-01-21/1611250203-613791-image.png
Toki0179 - Uh oh, another scammer!

First of all I did not do all of this on my own @tlkh40salt helped me find with this.

anyways lets get into the sauce!
This was the person we found advertising the sale of a cheap dedi server and so tlkh40 decided to dm him asking about it and got told to dm paq


"ip does not exist now" keep this in mind because this is important!


He claimed he was a partner with oneprovider and then deleted the message because he decided that he wasn't anymore


Here is the screenshot of him deciding to backtrack


He tried to stop us from seeing where the dedi came from


He ended up giving it and when 
we decided to look on whois we saw that the dedi was from contabo that which was slightly disappointing as I was expecting an ip from oneprovider. ip blurred due to contabos lack of ddos protection.


Just so it is more clear for the readers here is the proof its from contabo I have blurred out the ip because you know contabos ddos protection is not good at all!

Toki0179 - I forgot to say why the thing was important but basically its because he sent us the ips meaning that he was lying
Tomas - Toki0179 Wait... is this the guy that ran Host Horizon?
eraters - that was secuge
Tomas - eraters Are they the same people or no?
eraters - i don't think so, i dont remember a dude named paq
EmeraldMike - I got this same offer in my DMs as well. OFC i am not that dumb to fall for it. Also keeps insisting for you to pay because he wants to scam. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-01-21/1611252118-928834-image.png
EmeraldMike - Also claims to be PaRtNeReD but proceeded to link to his shit discord - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-01-21/1611252207-69512-image.png
Deleted User - paq is secuge
also the reason he wants that money is so he can activate his hetzner account so he can abuse sepa (well he says from his brothers bank acc)

eraters - oh yes here's where i have some fun
eraters - First. Secuge gained RusJS's trust and yoinked his hetzner account not giving it back. Second, he immediately banned everyone who supported Rus when this happened. Third, hosthorizon was using free nodes that were "donated" I'm pretty sure they were free credit. There's a lot more, but I don't really have the time to type it all out.
Deleted User - thats an extra i guess - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-01-22/1611274592-917576-image.png
mtt - EmeraldMike 
What provider?
i Am PaRtNErEd WiTh hEtZneR 
kk
PaY??!?!?
Why No REspoNd
onyx - mtt My thoughts exactly
Toki0179 - mtt yeah he says he is partnered with oneprovider to us then he deletes the message and backtracks
Daftscientist - Tomas yea i think so.
Daftscientist - eraters I'm quite sure he was abusing some sort of free credit/partner thing. Oh and yes im trying to be active on winterhoax.
EmeraldMike - Daftscientist lol trying to be active on here
luca - one of the executives Zepto asked me for my PayPal to be linked to his ovh account because "cloud projects require it to add a card" in return for anything from ovh

I don't even have PayPal lmao I just went along with it for a bit
Chirag - Hey there,

Blue Tree's discord: BlueTree242#0001
luffyy - k
luffyy - userid?
Chirag - luffyy 618129456011411496

BlueTree242 - Staff mistakely leaked his email, they instant deleted when they noticed.
Raiwy - Hi, I'm Raiwy, Co-Owner on Paqet. We not use Free Credit on AWS, we use paid instance.
Jedrik - Raiwy We not use Free Credit on AWS, we use paid instance.

understandable, have a nice day
luffyy - Blue tree Raiwy dm me luffy#0699
Chirag - BlueTree242 ah yes, I had to join on an alt and tell you to delete the god damn image, and you said on discord, "We don't care", then why are you here?
Chirag - Raiwy Provide Proof.
BlueTree242 - Just telling them 😉
BlueTree242 - No one can say a host is bad unless they tried it, and you didnt try it, you only registered
luffyy - blue tree can u dm me need to ask u smth important...
BlueTree242 - luffyy why?
luffyy - you can consider it as making ur host better
Chirag - BlueTree242 I'm so sure you're gonna close down in a month or you're gonna abuse aws to get free nodes
Raiwy - Chirag I don't have access to account with VPS
Chirag - Paqet discord invite: https://discord.gg/j3JJ3Nvshw
Chirag - Raiwy Ask the person who has access.
Chirag - Bxrk this thread isn't about me nor falix. why do you have to come everywhere and say that?
Chirag - This proves that they're creating new accounts for AWS and using credit cards of their users to get free trial again. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-03-29/1617040948-355915-screenshot-2021-03-29-23-30-22-16.jpg
Deleted User - Chirag that seems sketchy LMFAO
NighMayHigh - Clearly just abusing AWS free trials, or storing this info and using it to use their cards without consent
J0SH - SecuGe/Paq dont even attempt to make it look real its just a shit scam
Tomas - Oh Christ, that's SecuGe?
Jedrik - Now they're trying to cover it up 😬 - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-03-30/1617065929-960371-screenshot-2021-03-30-08-57-37-19.jpg

Tomas - TheRaiwy You will go to the police for working at Paqet, it's now a federal crime
Tomas - TheRaiwy Hey dude!

Stop blaming all of us when something happens to you!
You are committing fraudulent activities!
Shut the fuck up before I take you to the police!

Love you!
Chirag - TheRaiwy you don't own the egg, you're using an egg made by someone else and not you.
FatGrizzly - TheRaiwy Well, try again? 
Remember: No one has access to your servers except you, so clearly it must be someone on the staff team then
mtt - TheRaiwy Stop being goofy, you're commiting fraudulent activities with your "lifetime free" service thing. You're literally asking for PayPal credentials or Credit Cards for a "free service".
Just stfu, you're the one doing the illegal stuff.
Also btw, nobody here controls the egg other than you or any of your staff. 
So just give up already my guy
Tomas -  - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-03-30/1617118988-77986-image.png
Tomas - TheRaiwy Yeah, except the fact there's nothing interesting there.

I can easily just publish the HTML file of that whole groupchat if you want?
ExoticalCat - Hmmmmm
Chirag - Tomas give this man an award of the dumbest person ever
Chirag - ​https://everything.is-bannable.xyz/em0994C2B.png
seems like Paqet is gone, I'm sure that they'll be back later
someone told that paqet had shutdown before this too, and then they came back
HasX - Hi! Im HasX I was the Developer/Co-Owner of Paqet that guy i realised feeded me with a heap of a shit , If you hosted in paqet your maps most likely got leaked or sold. With @BlueTree242 we successfully nulled the scam server. I apologise for everyone specially @lamaker and @puggo cause i was rude with them (Narutro or Gapire what the hell is his name fired me to shout with them) Bye. 
-HasX
ExoticalCat - HasX Wow
RusJS - HasX Wow dude
Chirag - HasX did gapire tell you where he got the nodes from? Or did you ever bother to check where he got the nodes from?
Bxrk - HasX thats some bs you're a certified scam
