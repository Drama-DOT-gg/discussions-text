Aaron_ - bullshit, pure bullshit. Some people don't change at all.

Oliver1234dotdot - This "bug" has been here for a long time, it's probably not even a bug.

You don't have to verify your Hetzner account if you create it closest to the address of the IP you have.
Ibrahim - Oliver1234dotdot no, it still asks for verification via PayPal
BeansCam - I said shut the fuck up dont even try on Milan you little saddo.
PadowYT2 - why the f did you post on a thread thats literally 1 year old
