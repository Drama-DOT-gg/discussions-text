iiChxrlly_ - wtf is this
Jedrik - Merging.
Tomas - _MrKnight_ It's not illegal, it's overallocation.

 In most places your company doesn't need to be registered during operations, but it depends.
_MrKnight_ - pog

candy - Tomas Yeah, He is just mad because he left the hosting lmfao
He was doing illegal stuff his self.
_MrKnight_ - now there worthy owner dm swearing - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-02-10/1612946047-317531-capture.png
Tomas - Can you reformat your post so I can actually read it
_MrKnight_ - candy can u say what illegal stuff i did
_MrKnight_ - Tomas im bad at english sorry for it
Jedrik - _MrKnight_ that they brought vps of 8gb and said adding 50gb swap i said no its illegal to have a huge amount of swap

It is not illegal.

_MrKnight_ they used .tk

Nothing wrong, however sets an unprofessional image for your host.

_MrKnight_ and now they are abusing iolons and hetzner (its a fucking scam dont trust them )

Please provide evidence within the next 48 hours.

_MrKnight_ they made privacy policy yesterday when i said to make one they are not even a registerd company its DAMN BULLSHIT!!!

You don't need to be a registered company, what's the problem with them having a prp?

_MrKnight_ now when they got a funder they demoted me and made him the owner nice hosting!!!!!

I mean, it's the rightful owner's decision whether or not who he wants on his team.

_MrKnight_ and forgot to say they dint give me panel access
as they where scared
i would have do something

As they should, don't follow in @badsk's footsteps

In conclusion, most if not all, of the information on this thread is invalidated,
