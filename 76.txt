AspectOfficial - I've seen people posting hostings using Contabo as hosting provider.

We all started out by Contabo, it's not stated as an crime to use contabo to start your own hobby. Don't see an Host reselling Contabo as an Winter/SummerHoax. If they are not false advertising or whenever they say they have no DDoS protection or an very bad one that's honest. You must have an budget to start an company, that's true but not everyone haves it / doesn't want to spend it and want's just to do it for expierience. Sadly this is abused by lot's of scammers. My point here is that Contabo or smth else is not an crime.

I hope you learned the lesson.
Deleted User - Uh ofc using contabo is not a crime lol
Jen - AspectOfficial Contabo isn't hoaxable or a scam
They are just mad because its not expensive premium Hardware
Contabo offers great options for a lower price
mxnugget - I don't see Contabo bad at all - yes, maybe they're using older CPUs/hardware and the DDOS Protection isn't great, but you get many cores, storage and RAM for what you pay. And they also have unlimited bandwidth.
Deleted User - Contabo is good for free / budget hosts, as long as your not overpricing the crap out of it
deleted - Contabo is bad, if you say 10000000000gb DEDEOS PREOTOECTION NOONE CAN TAKE US DOWN EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
AspectOfficial - deleted Says the one who was reselling Contabo :)
HCS - Using them is fine, Hetzner is much better tho.
deleted - AspectOfficial when did i even use contabo? even for a personal VPS i'd not use them
SteveCos - There would be so much dramas right now if people still think using Contabo is bad
