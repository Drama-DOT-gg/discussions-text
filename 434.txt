weedpl - After reversing a connection, I've gotten a IP: 213.235.178.17

It's some weird provider ip lol.
DeadBush - they are banning user just because someone kept their username as gay  which is homophobic asf.
and if someone had custom domain email lmfao
Yie - Time to join the server and get banned
DeadBush - That guys is accusing me of filling their disk space. I told I was sus on kitto but he is clean and idek how to do it lmao. He dosent even know how to read English ig. and plus. and plus since they promise unlimited disk we have rights to fill and ask for more if needed cuz their tos is shit asf which says no nonsese and chez rules apply. So they ahvent mentioned about host loss etc.
