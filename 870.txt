Jamie_ - I am sure there is more to this host as I just got banned for asking about a cracked cpanel license, but I will let the people of drama.gg do some digging.

Cracked Cpanel Proof: 



https://cpanel.crystalcloud.xyz/ &lt;-- THIS IS A GRABIFY LINK, ONLY CLICK WITH A VPN
(for those who don't want to click on it, it goes to https://lon87.mynetns.co.uk:2083/ ~ @Robert)



This guy then went on to say that the cpanel URL will only be given to paid customers... Like that won't be leaked withing the first 5 minutes.  You also have to make a ticket in their discord server to buy a paid plan which just smells like a big scam to me. In my opinion, if you can't afford something like WHMCS or even blesta at the least for paid plans, your host shouldn't be operating as it is obviously underfunded. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-11/1628641259-56649-image.png
