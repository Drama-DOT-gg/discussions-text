They're using a .tech domain, which you can get for free from the Github Student Developer Pack. When I DM'ed one of their customers on the host's legitimacy, the customer told the owner (TechZack) about me and I immediately got banned from TZSolutions Discord server. Now, the customer didn't mean it or even thought I was going to get banned. Some hosts just can't take simple criticism even when it's in private messages.

about 6 or 7, because of plugins and world generation

Zombieplays04122 â€” 08/27/2021
100 gb sounds good, my current storage is 10 gb which is pretty bad

That would include DDOS Protection 2 Cores of a CPU and 8GB RAM and also being on a Panel

This would also stop you being on a Overallocated Server as you would have your own server just for you.

They gave the customer a Chicago location even though the customer said that he was in Florida, which I will get into later about their deceptive locations. They use HostVenom and their specs for the Chicago location are i7-6700K and likely 64 GB ram (the max memory that processor can handle). The irony here is when they say: "That would include DDOS Protection 2 Cores of a CPU and 8GB RAM and also being on a Panel This would also stop you being on a Overallocated Server as you would have your own server just for you." Really? The i7-6700K only has 4 cores/8 threads and you're giving them 2 cores, which is half of the processor already and 1/8 of the system's memory. If you do the same to one more customer and allocate them 2 cores, then your cores aren't dedicated anymore, they're shared/overallocated.


In their discord, they claim to have secured Los Angeles, Miami, and New York (since the beginning of the month of August 2021). Sounds very much like the whole premium ReliableSite squad, but no. Further investigation shows that they have only one of these locations. In fact, they use Contabo-New York, Hostvenom-Chicago, OVH-Montreal. That's very concentrated on the northeast of North America. https://securitytrails.com/list/apex_domain/tzsolutions.tech

No worries.
I'll be waiting there.

They gave the customer a Chicago location even though the customer said that he was in Florida, which I will get into later about their deceptive locations. They use HostVenom and their specs for the Chicago location are i7-6700K and likely 64 GB ram (the max memory that processor can handle). The irony here is when they say: "That would include DDOS Protection 2 Cores of a CPU and 8GB RAM and also being on a Panel This would also stop you being on a Overallocated Server as you would have your own server just for you." Really? The i7-6700K only has 4 cores/8 threads and you're giving them 2 cores, which is half of the processor already and 1/8 of the system's memory. If you do the same to one more customer and allocate them 2 cores, then your cores aren't dedicated anymore, they're shared/overallocated.


In their discord, they claim to have secured Los Angeles, Miami, and New York (since the beginning of the month of August 2021). Sounds very much like the whole premium ReliableSite squad, but no. Further investigation shows that they have only one of these locations. In fact, they use Contabo-New York, Hostvenom-Chicago, OVH-Montreal. That's very concentrated on the northeast of North America. https://securitytrails.com/list/apex_domain/tzsolutions.tech

ðŸ¤¦Boy, your main website is just a one-page static HTML page. It doesn't serve any special purpose other than linking everything back to their Discord server. So about the "hardware upgrade" aka moving to another shared hosting provider. They are currently using NovoNode shared web hosting. - https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/875884186496532491/882359661674758154/pnvOeWV.png
The_Fallen - A user named Nott#9857 has been advertising for them and is straight up slandering other hosts https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/882423288188514304/882842650884055090/unknown.png https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/882423288188514304/882842865930223656/unknown.png
Sydney - The_Fallen I have yet to see a server with DDR5....
The_Fallen - Sydney A computer can't run DDR5 as normal RAM, its just not something that has been worked out, only GPUs can run DDR5
Error404 - The CEO Confirmed that the DM Advertiser and the User on MCM "NotHaxx" was not involvement of their hosting needs and has contacted every host that was affected by the issue and some sort of Lawsuit is taking place against this user Nott.

I don't see an issue with the fact this host uses a Template? is that an issue as I don't see why that is a problem. Let them be them for that.
Revolver - Error404 Woah there bud, those are some big scary words "Lawsuit". It seems like you're just trying to cover up your tracks but failed. A lawsuit for DM advertising on Discord is the biggest joke I've heard today. You got all your customers through DM advertising, and you got exposed for it, so that's why you're making a big deal out of it?

I never said that using a template was an issue, so why you trying concentrate on that instead of all the other things like discord billing?

The biggest problem here Error404 or should I say TechZack... is that you still won't admit to DM advertising. Yeah, I know it's you TechZack behind that 404error account. You're just simply trying to avoid and dissolve the responsibility by acting we didn't know it was your doing. Stop using "The CEO" and "them", we know it's you TechZack.
