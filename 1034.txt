IoNetty - QloxHost Aight time to explain this shit. There probably in a bad relation, you can tell from there grammar that they can't sue shit. I heard a fake trademark and stuff before. From there grammar I don't think they can aford a court hearing or any of that, just use common sense at this point.
SpadeSle - IoNetty indeed that is true the entire operation was for him to stop harrasing a discord user we both figured he is a dumbass so we did it anyways the onkly shit we got out of it his address his ip and he installed a virus i made in python so i have full access to his pc ill be leaving him alone my main objectives are done
SpadeSle - IoNetty what i meant by objective is done is that aslong as we have private info if he tries to ddos my friend (i met the Qlox months ago his orignall name was 1Gl0ck2) we will just leak them sounds fucked up yes but less fucked up then he trying to cause fake drama and trying to make a friend commit suicide over a minecraft playthrough
Kowone - SpadeSle he seriously don't know how to ddos lol, what can you expect from that person lol
SpadeSle - QloxHost holding people for hostage? bitch you holded a person in hostage threatening to come to their house and "kill them" but you are pussy for stealing your friends ip and threatening them and fucking blackmailing them way worse then this shit time for you to learn the truth point of the operation to get more info out of you and possibly sell them to a website way less fucked up then trying to cause a suicide! am tired of your shit the operation is fucking done so one more wrong move i am gonna leak it including your address ip REAL name and also your gmail accounts since i have full access to your pc from the nox police virus i made so every move you make through your pc will be recorded now if you want to discuss further add me on discord SpadeSl#0387
