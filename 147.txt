Proof provided by the victim, Watzon just ‘declared’ she’s actually 25 which makes it worse and it’s basically Grooming.

Threatening and Manipulation

Threatened a staff member to leave a position at another hosting just because she didn't want him to be in a host with Jen. Banned me for working there, no explanation or reason at all.

mtt - Oh Watzon, Believe it or not, I saw your message even tho I was banned. 
Stop lying to the server, there's A LOT of proof about what you've done. Also, I know you're watching this... reply to this post instead of hiding in a server we are all banned on.

If you're from the century hosting server and want a way better explanation than "I didnt do it" DM me (mtt#0001) 
or reply to this post.
mtt - Also jen has nothing to do with this post :) Get a valid excuse.
HCS - I got banned from century
mtt - HCS Yeah, that’s one of the points I made on my post. She bans people just for exposing her or giving their opinion.
mtt - I have made it so you can see the images. And see they in fact are not photoshop or Inspect Element as she says

mtt - Not her trying to excuse herself with everything proven by us. I love my life.
mtt - Also, since I don't think you'd understand. I'm filing the DMCA complaint as soon as possible with the logo which is my full property and I have all the rights around it.

mtt - I sent a middleman to Century to seal a DMCA deal about my logo. He got banned from the server almost a minute in. It's impossible to talk with her about anything, and as expected of her... she banned my middleman. I have no choice but to file the takedown notice right away.

Korudo - This is a well made thread. @AYS please give this confirmed cuz matt probs spent like 750 years typing it
mtt - Korudo Yes! I spent about 3 hours making it because the website lagged on the first one and didn’t post :D also compiling a lot of proof along with more people
mtt - StarLightz same, I can’t post a comment without reloading the page
mtt - I would like to add this to the data loss scams proof!

Koisip - Also if your wondering, No Watzon cannot code bots.
He uses discord bot maker (application which makes bot coding fucking easy)

And he also used some code from Titeiiko (back when he used DBM)



Sidenote, from Titeiiko's experience: He was basically used. He was never rewarded anything nor was credited. He didn't give a shit about her stealing the info but he did get pissed how he was used. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-10-22/1603396327-110453-image.png

Koisip - EmeraldMike Yo do realize even Watzon's own staff team is against her. They leaked info, that's how I managed to get private information.
Koisip - EmeraldMike 
Also she is doing illegal stuff aswell,
Attempted DDos, Sending Nude to Minors, Threatening Others, Legit Stealing HoloHosting.

She is committing legit crimes and you defending her can legit get you in trouble with her.
Is that what you want you fucking clown? Is that what you want?

In this video, Watzon goes by "Wilda2399." The audio from Wilda2399 sounds very similar to Watzon

Previous History of FiveM


The last post was 6 months ago before she took over Holo Hosting. Both apparently were taken down for being "stupid Professional." Meaning she had a previous history of selling FiveM.

Part of Leaking Platform


She has an account on "Leakerz" which is a page dedicated to leaking resources.
It can be confirmed to be her because this leaking platform also leaks "FiveM" as well. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-10-23/1603495311-268769-image.png

Koisip - Shiv mtt also the fact that she is selling a bot that literally a noob could make in 1 week.
Jen - Koisip lol, A bot can't even test for covid on discord
Lmfao how is u gonna send the DNA Samples
Koisip - Jen idk Jen, I do be wondering why u trusted a man like that
Jen - lmfao, she didn't even make the logo
You just photoshop a fucking cartoon cloud with text and same font
and you can literally copy the logo and claim it as urs.

Tomas - what a joke
Koisip - Jen didn't you literally stress test your own school network
onyx - Koisip wouldn't it be doing them a favor? :joy:
Koisip - onyx To be fair

Both Watzon and Jen are shits.

Jen literally stress tested his school and being poor as fuck and can't afford a host
Watzon has connections to ddos and being a literal dick
Jen - Koisip actually i can afford a host so that would be wrong
Koisip - shure
Jedrik - sure
Jen - Jedrik brah i have money its not like i'm a broke ass.
i spend a lot of my money on domains with freenom tho
Koisip - Jen 

"I have a lot of money"
  
invites Watzon to be Co-Owner and gets overturned because Jen forgot to pay his bill.
  Shure
WockySlush - ah yes, Century / Vue Hosting the worst scam of them all. Haley (Deseray Watson) herself is pretty racist, I could probably find the screenshots if u dm me.

She claims to be rich, and able to pay off $700,000 fines for conducting ddos attacks.
no hate intended against such a person but she's also a trans-female.

uhmm, she's said the hard r directly to a 23 year old man of color in a discord VC (I'm 90% sure I have a clip)
and her host overall is a scam. After you buy a FiveM server from her (which she's not permitted to sell) she will ask for owner on your server and fuck your server in the ass until your to the point where you have to shutdown but by then she has your ip, name etc etc just from talking to her in general.
WockySlush - funny story actually, she wanted me to pay her a clients bill for that month to stop ddosing me
Two - Jen on freenom. 
I don't really care if you actually pay for domains there, but most likely you aren't paying for the domains on freenom if it's like TK, etc.
Jedrik - Two He's paying for the domains there
EmeraldMike - Well odly he can seem to afford hosting... sorta.
gothicflufflepuff - Where do I even start. I was totally unaware of any of this and was told about century from a friend and decided I was going to get a fiveM server for GTA V Online, and saw they had addon options which included eup, 600+ cars and 100+ scripts. I know the owner of the eup She is reselling and know for a fact She has no resell rights because I've spoken with the developer about it at length so I purchased her fiveM 4 pack and got the addon scripts and she told me it takes 24-48 hours to have them added but they'd have them added within 1-2. I should note that she told me that they offer trial periods which she originally said was 7 days and then that quickly changed to 2 days.

So I purchased My server, and waited about 12 hours and still no scripts were added so I went to go message her on discord and it said I couldn't message her than out of nowhere I get a friend request from her and she claims she never blocked me now mind you I had made a post in the general chat of the century hosting discord where her and her staff laughed at my posts and asked if I had made a ticket on her site which I had done and it was ignored. So I put a claim in to paypal to get a refund at which point she told me I wasn't going to get my refund and I said you wanna make a bet and she said bet you're not getting your refund at which point I didn't care to hear whatelse she had to say so I removed her from my friends list. 

I went to login to century and it said my account was suspended so I posted all my proof and screenshots to paypal, and they waited for her to respond which she never did so paypal took it upon themselves to change the case type and to escalate it and I woke up this morning to my case being approved and my refund being issued.

Then I looked in my email only to find a new invoice for a month of service which  I had just paid for one a couple days ago. 

I'd like to add that She is still using the logo that mtt sent her DMCA removal warning for. and in the last 16 hours she has tried to add me to discord about 8 times and has threatened my best friend telling him she has his ip as if she is going to hack him or something. 

NO ONE SHOULD DO BUSINESS WITH CENTURY HOSTING OR CENTURY DESIGN OR HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH HAYLEE WATZON OR HOWEVER THE HELL YOU SPELL HER LAST NAME. SHE LITERALLY TOOK MY MONEY, REMOVED ME FROM THE DISCORD SERVERS, SUSPENDED MY SERVICES ON THE CENTURY WEBSITE AND THOUGHT SHE WAS GOING TO KEEP MY MONEY AND GET AWAY WITH IT AND THEN SENDS ME A NEW INVOICE THINKING IM GOING TO BE STUPID ENOUGH TO PAY FOR IT? NAHH.

HERE IS THE LOGO THAT IS BEING SENT OUT IN THE EMAILS THEY SEND OUT WHICH I READ ABOUT THAT SHE HAS NO RIGHT TO USE...



if you look on the Century Website the phone number that is listed is totally different than what is listed on paypal...



I'll be posting more of my screenshots once I get the chance to edit my name out of them for privacy reasons but anyone considering using Century PLEASE I BEG YOU SAVE YOURSELF THE HASSLE AND STRESS! - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-02-01/1612221221-922440-centurylogo.jpg

gothicflufflepuff - Haylee Watzon's Discord Accounts


Not to mention since She has been repeatedly trying to add me on discord, I also got a random add from a random account that only had one mutual server and friend which is a developer which I thought was weird. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-02-01/1612221628-51897-haylee-watzon-discord.jpg
Vanquish - gothicflufflepuff man you've been through some stuff with her too huh lol
Vanquish - Jen haven't heard about the nudes part surprisingly bet she has though
mtt - Vanquish its true, not theirs but a dick pic of someone else lmao
Vanquish - mtt ah she sent that to me too then.
gothicflufflepuff - Vanquish Yeah I have been through quite a lot in the past 24 hours, and She tried to tell me I wouldn't get my refund back from paypal and it didn't even take 12 hours and I had it given back because I had so much proof to provide and they gave her a chance to respond and provide information and they provided nothing so they voted in my favor. Then She tries to send me an invoice this morning at 4am? like heck am I having anything to do with that company or her, She keeps trying to friend me on discord it's getting really quite annoying. I saw her typing something so I'm going to assume that she has typed a message so that the second I accept her friend request she can send it.. I'm not as dumb as her to go and accept her friend request,

I wish there was a way to warn people to not join her discord because I've heard She has people join her discord just to get their IP Addresses which really wouldn't surprise me in the slightest..
Vanquish - gothicflufflepuff 
she's such a scum bag lmfao

she runs this booter/stresser by the way:
https://pmastresser.xyz

You won't win with her, she's very ignorant. Don't send her this thread  if possible either she does have my IP from a recent thing that happened. She'll recognize my name. Anyway, the best thing to do is block her and request a refund on PayPal don't accept any invoices and such obviously.
Vanquish - gothicflufflepuff oh also, forgot to add she was trying to get with my friend and told him she was a female yet it turns out she's actually trans-female and changed her name to Haylee (Deseray) Watzon. Nothing against being trans but lying about it is a different story.
Karisma - Lol imagine lying lol you over exaggerating you got your services then you made a dispute and then PayPal says that I won the case because you lied lien 8 times that 1 you didn’t revive a service 2 you scammed the system 3 you said you didn’t agree to the TOS 4. You said we did all this shit yo you and made you go to lol so imagine s
coming here and spreading Lied i've only ever has 3 disputes before.

gothicflufflepuff - Vanquish She knows about the thread, She did a "response to remers" video and posted it in her support section on the century hosting discord... but I think it's a private link because I can't find it on her channel but she was on this post, and on the other site and addressing all the posts and going into dms and addressing everything.. 

Funniest Thing EVER that I'd like to add, is that She keeps sending me an invoice, yet I paid for a month of service on the 30th, so both yesterday and this morning I woke up to an invoice in my inbox but since the afternoon on the 31st I've had this show up...



Sorry for Inking out the name of my roleplay server don't need that gremlin harrassing me further.. so my services are suspended but She wants more money from me? Yeah right nice try. 

Also She said I wouldn't get my refund from century back and with all the evidence I submitted to paypal in less than 12 hours they voted in my favor and I got my refund and she keeps trying to send me friend requests but I ignore them because I honestly have nothing to say to her at all. 

I want nothing to do with her sad excuse of a company and if She doesn't stop trying to add me and doesn't stop sending me invoices, My mother works with the police department where I'm from and I'll be making a call and finding out where this clown is from and letting the police know what She is up to with all her hacking, ddos attacks, ip stressors, porn hub premium accounts that are stolen, the developers are already serving stuff for her reselling their stuff without having reselling rights because she is profiting off of something she has no right to profit from so I don't care if this person is 15, 16, 18, 21, 25 whatever age I've been hearing and I certainly dont care if they are a man or woman cause they certainly sound like a man in their YouTube videos they are going to get into some legal trouble. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-02-03/1612364889-624672-inkedsuspendedserver-li.jpg
gothicflufflepuff - Vanquish I knew something was up there, I'm a member of the LGBTQ+ being Bisexual but You don't lie and keep that from someone if you're trying to get with them.. like seriously you should really be honest with people and tell them straight up not keep it a secret and surprise them wtf is their problem! now the voice in the youtube videos make so much more sense.
Vanquish - gothicflufflepuff Agreed.
gothicflufflepuff - Karisma I didn't receive the services I paid for, I didn't recieve the scripts and then you suspended my services before I even got them all so the point is I'm done with you and your "company" and I'll be posting my screenshots where you "bet" I wouldn't get my refund from paypal and I'll even post screenshots of everything I told paypal because my case originally said I didn't receive alll my services and then it was changed to my services weren't as they were described, You're just butt hurt that I won and got my refund so your dumb ass keeps thinking you can keep sending me invoices and I'll pay, well paypal is investigating you so don't be surprised when you don't have a paypal account and all your customers are only able to pay for your stolen services using cashapp.
gothicflufflepuff - Vanquish I love how "haylee" is coming on here saying I lied to paypal, I opened a case saying I didn't get all my services because I paid for an add on of 100+ scripts and they weren't added and then my case was changed to received product but it wasn't what it was advertised as and they gave time for century to respond but they didn't so then they closed the case in my favor because of all the evidence and proof and screenshots I submitted and voted in my favor that I should get my refund back, I never lied. I never got my scripts added that I paid for and then I go check if they were added and my account was suspended as you see above. The TOS they have posed is some bullshit, but I followed it, it says I have 24 hours to request a refund of services if I'm not happy and I requested for my refund from paypal because I was removed from the discord after posting and asking for help in the general channel after submitting two support tickets and being laughed at so since I wasn't in the discord anymore and I knew it was a waste of time talking to that clown I decided it was easier to go right to paypal and let them know that I had submitted support tickets and wasn't responded to, I was laughed at by the support people IN the discord before being removed, and the fact that "haylee" likes to threaten people when she has their ip addresses I wasn't going to play their game of back and fourth adding and deleting back and fourth on discord so the bitch can stop trying to add me unless they just like wasting their time hoping ill friend them cause it isn't happening!
Vanquish - gothicflufflepuff ah yes providing addon scripts as a hosting provider and selling fivem in general without being permitted.

gothicflufflepuff - Here's the last response I got from Haylee before blocking them completely and contacting paypal to make sure nothing from Century touches My paypal account... - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-02-10/1612932037-400997-lastemailfromcentury.jpg
CEOCenturyHosting - gothicflufflepuff lol i love Jen on how your trying to play victims we informed you right when you made a payment that you had to wait 24 - 48 hours to receive the Scripts about 2 hours later you make a PayPal case begging for your money back if you just asked i probs would have gave you it back but you lied to PayPal 8 different times then PayPal just closed the case in my favor i attempted to reach out to you because i didn't want to leave you with nothing but you informed me so here i am and yes you get invoices but not by me its called WHMCS
Vanquish - @CEOCenturyHosting omg??
CEOCenturyHosting - gothicflufflepuff yes your server was suspended due to a dispute made from your account also please note your the most idiotic customer i ever had i only ever had 5 disputes in 4 Months with over 600 Paying Clients and i think 1 or 2 of them are from me to other people - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-02-10/1612991605-136839-image.png
CEOCenturyHosting - Vanquish lol do you have notifications on
Vanquish - CEOCenturyHosting nobody asked you violate fivem tos therefore you're scum &gt;.&lt;
CEOCenturyHosting - Vanquish Umm we don't violate FiveM TOS states that we cant resell Hosting off a another company which we don't we own our dedicated servers then we sell off of them which FiveM TOS Clearly states that we can run FiveM Services off an Dedicated Server so with that in mind we don't violate FiveM TOS but if you have a problem with someone violating FiveM TOS go talk to Red Neck which he is because fivem tos states that you cant sell props for a fivem server for profit

vijaypondini - Hello all. My name's vijay, and I've been around holo hosting, and century hosting ever since everything started, and i've seen everything, and all the accusations, and all the things going on.
I am first off, extremely glad this post exists exposing important things Haylee Watzon has done to customers at century hosting. Second I am glad the people who I still know, mtt, jen, shroom, saml, i've had good ties with them, made the effort to make this post, and it has now gotten over 2,400 views. Which is amazing.

I'll explain my side of the horror story now. Not bit by bit, but just events that have happened to me he whole time I was involved in century hosting/Holo Hosting

Initially joined holo hosting as staff, ran tickets, became administration, created servers, everything went amazing. JustinTK, also known as TMC, ( who is now long gone ) proceeded to fuck over holo hosting, resulting in deep pockets of loss for Jen. At the time, Jen was the sole owner of Holo Hosting.

Jen being at a stalemate had trusted watzon to pay off bills for Holo Hosting to continue and keep the continue alive. A merger happened, it became Century hosting, a whole rework, site made by jaryn etc.etc. everything was done well. I had requested administration access as usual, but obviously, watzon has not provided that, with the fact that "she doesn't trust me", when i've been around before she even existed xD

Now, it proceeds to more fights between Jen and Watzon about VPS's not being setup, improper management, I casually watch by the side, trying to calm either parties down. At this point, Jen had made a mistake of transferring discord ownership of the discord to Watzon, which was the first big mistake. What proceeded then was total dominant control over discord, and eventually the servers associated. And then came the point, where it was only century hosting, and jen is no longer allowed to be involved.

I still stay as staff, but am denied every single permission in the company, no perms to access panel as support operator, no access to WHMCS billing, and the only thing I could do was help in discord tickets, which were so braindead anyway. 
Proceeding, I kind of lost hope for the company. Then on one fine day, I get accused of leaking information. You know what I leaked? An announcement from century hosting, with watzon saying not to be friends with jen -_- That's literally it. 
Then I was accused ONCE AGAIN of leaking server data to people, when I couldn't even access shit? Hmm, funny indeed to see. At that point, I was just like screw this shit, I stayed as a member because it was fun to watch the probems watzon goes down with. 
Few weeks later i'm reinstated as staff ( I wanted to understand what in gods' name was going on with the company ). This time it's the same type of access, just tickets. I complain that i don't have more access and the repsonse is always "Yeah well you don't do anything anyway". At that point i didn't want to try and argue more.
Watzon also claimed that she pays staff, but then later on said "I can't pay because of legal issues", I literally pulled up the minimum working age in India ( where I live ) and showed it to her, and she just said "Well it's not allowed." I mean she had no argument to that.
Also got screamed at in a call for "leaking data" by her and then saying i was forever banned from century lmao.


Today, I rejoined century hosting discord to see what was going on, and it was silent as ever. I left after reading this article now. Watzon doesn't think straight. She doesn't even know what she's saying from time to time. It's a horror to deal with watzon these days. Not worth my time.

That's my time at holo/century in a nutshell. Hope anything i've said gives anyone a sense of idea what i've done. @Jen let's catch up. I want to learn more.

Peace
eraters - i was not expecting more paragraphs
CEOCenturyHosting - vijaypondini Well, I determine that's a deception from top to bottom you spam me for invites following kicks you then you delete your messages of begging to be invited back to Century. You don't operate a corporation including you are not in control Sive to run a firm because of the simplistic reality you don't have good characters abilities you believe that you are constantly correct the day after Jen sold ownership of Holo yourself Jayen furthermore Jen &amp; Mtt &amp; Shroom were banned due to relationship with Jen after showing private chats you were only yonder to plead for money which you always arranged sometime out of your day to inquire. I was in Century for about a week Holo was breaking at its period. I was brought into holo to preserve the firm aka with financiers for which I settled 99.9% of all financial responsibilities bedsides a 3 dollar Cpanel simply before you came back after your initial discharge from Century Samco aka Co-Founder rehired you. I declared that I didn't require you beyond more durable 8 1/2 days after you send me a letter about how we didn't get that many MC Clients which we arranged people just didn't have questions then you demanded to be our financial advisor I'm not giving anyone access to my family millions so you want me to give you access to our money source which I'm not gonna give a bankrupt teenager admittance to my values that I established into Century Jen Ex CEO was fighting to keep Holo operating as you as his Financial Advisor haha by renting servers from other companies. Since he's no longer apart of my company I went out and paid for a dedicated server including then tunneled them over OVH hehe Century may not be the Best corporation for some people but that's their judgment moreover I can't change that although I'm dam certain that I'm not gonna pay kids to help another kid run their company hehe comparatively well as begging to be unbanned and begging to be my Financial Advisor. I think have seen some people say that I should close Century but I will not close it not today not tomorrow maybe in the future but that's not this moment I will not give up on my Current clients. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-02-13/1613239903-343476-image.png

Jen - vijaypondini ikr
EmeraldMike - hmmmmm. I feel like Watzon is taking the term human resources way to literally LMAO.

Tesla - Jen you can’t hit cloud flare with only 40
Jen - Tesla Who said i hit cloudflare with 40?

Deleted User - They use better Discord haha, I think thats against ToS- if I am correct---- Here
bigstepdaddy - Rizer I dont use Better Discord - Discord Canary
bigstepdaddy - Jen lol you say its shit because you dont have a company and you were banned from Century lol
Vanquish - bigstepdaddy Can you please, for the love of all things good just get a life.
EmeraldMike - bigstepdaddy false he does have his own shit
vijaypondini - Has @CEOCenturyHosting @CEO stopped replying now?

Is it because you're so ashamed of wasting money being a rich spoiled kid? ( I highly doubt this )
Is it because you know you're against FiveM ToS?
Is it because you've gotten rid of all of your staff you want to become a dictator of a hosting company where anything you say goes?
Is it because you scam people out of their services?
Is it because you DDoS people?
Is it because you're toxic in voice chats?
Is it because your business is bleeding money and your parents finally figured out?
Is it because your so mind numbingly bad at running a host?

I think it's all of the above, but I'd love to hear your bleak and thoughtless opinion and reply to this.
Jen - bigstepdaddy First i run a vpn now, and this is something i am proud of 
and 2nd idc if i was banned from century, Century is just gay, its homophobic, Anyone who uses century can kiss winterhoax's ass
vijaypondini - @CEOCenturyHosting @CEO 
I also don't give a tiny rat's fuck about your shitty money status and whether you're rich or not.
No one cares, you're a spoiled little brat, and you do NOT deserve the money you get.
Ungrateful little piece of shit, learn how to use money.
EmeraldMike - vijaypondini Yes the only thing you should use money on is me XD
Jen - EmeraldMike lmfao
bigstepdaddy - vijaypondini well i am rich and i am spoiled lol because i make bank baby hehe i don't care what other people say because they don't have money like me they cant afford the stuff i do i probes send about 1 - 2 thousand a day no one here can do that don't talk shit because you broke and you don't got bank hehe i bet you if i had a spend battel with any of you i would win because i don't have a cap and before you say daddies money lol i kicked my dad out the house at 7 soooooo its more like mommies money

As you don't seem to have a ToS you are illegally charging cancellation fees. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-02-18/1613669579-516306-image.png
EmeraldMike - bigstepdaddy  How the hell is your license not suspended

Jen - I would like to clarify
 that this is not a tos - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-02-18/1613670085-628124-notos.png
Jen - making an additional site that does not lead directly to the tos does not count
EmeraldMike - Jen T0S 100
Jen - The main TOS Leads to this - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-02-18/1613670154-967029-image.png
Jen - There is no TOS
There for you are conducting illegal service in the state of California

Vanquish - Sloth LOL
Two - Watzon is banned in Winterhoax, so there's no point in talking about him now. Not like (s)he's going to do anything, especially without freedom of speech. stares at falixnodes
Jen - Two she constantly makes alts and talks on here
i think we don't really have a choice bud
vijaypondini - bigstepdaddy Same shit, mommy's money, daddy's money. No one gives a fuck about your financial status.

All we see if a rich and spoiled fucker. We don't need your pussy comments about your spending habits and daily life, no one cares. No one also cares about spending battles. Get out of here.
vijaypondini - All we care about is the illegal shit you're doing, all the crimes you're commiting, and the fact that you're so fucking dumb you won't even admit to doing these crimes, but instead make alt accounts to prove nothing, just keep flexing about breaking the law. 

Such a fucking disgrace to this world to even continue doing illegal shit like this.
EmeraldMike - vijaypondini that about sums this up in a nutshell lol
there is also the bad service in general
EmeraldMike - dam bitch is raiding now
