Southy - Well most people would say its terribe but I would say that it's pretty damn good for a free host.
The man running this host is a grown man who loves sneakyhub he wants to make it his future job maybe soon.
He currently does free hosting and paid hosting cause, thats how you bring in customers... aswell as he has a god damn job irl and with a girlfriend so. next time you say that sneakyhub hosting is terrible check the news in his server he is trying to fix this shit that you say doesnt work.
Thank you for reading my ted talk! &lt;3
Have a blessed day 
Southy! &lt;3
