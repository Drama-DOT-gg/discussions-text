SoulFire69 - Im in need of some good free hosts with decent resources
Dviih - Every very small free host is good because no one use it = no overallocation
SoulFire69 - Dviih well i cant find any ones that are small lol thats why i created this thread
Dviih - SoulFire69 That's why free small hosts is good lmao you can't find
SoulFire69 - Dviih yeah right
but do you have any üòÉ
Dviih - SoulFire69 No but why not get a cheap minecraft host?
BaconHead - Go for centronodes
calcal - none
Scripted - https://dsc.gg/fr33host
Robert - Please just go for a paid host, the only reason a hosting service could be free is that you are the product.
KejiDiscord - Go for a cheap host like pebblehost, apex etc if you can afford it, its better than free hosts which MAY sell your data &amp; other info
eraters - KejiDiscord i dont think you should reccomend apex and call it cheap
Grabstop - eraters ikr
less than 1$ is cheap

GamerOmega - Dviih most small hosts are either too good, will grow and will have to overallocate or either too bad and will close after their free trial nodes will end
Dviih - GamerOmega Literally what i was going to say
IoNetty - I have a vps you can host a server on.
Two - centronodes is the best known free host up to date in my opinion, due to the fact that it could clearly sustain itself and get money to keep their servers alive, but people tend to not like centronodes because you need to earn coins by doing stuff

dchu096 - Not that hard to dig for free hosts tbh. go to something like disboard and search for free hosting and join a few random ones to try out. Thats usually how i hunt for hostings ngl.
ItzJack - I prefer centro nodes as best host.
tan_playz - I've been using free hosts for a while and notice most of the big hosts are owned by badsk, galaxic owner mike and the primesrv gang or wtever and their hostings are the worst the only hosting services that are alive are small hosts due to their less allocation but the thing is theres no way we can really find them 
so hence only centronodes is a good free hosting service that we all know
Chirag - SoulFire69 I'll tell you the best free host.
it is GET A JOB.
SimpSausage - The best free host is Supreme Nodes. That's what I use at-least...
Timanttikuutio - Chirag this tbh. if you somehow can even get a few euros a month to pay for a mc server, just host it on your pc lmao
Two - discord bot or mc hosting?
Timanttikuutio - Timanttikuutio and if you're hosting at home, you can just portforward and be done with it. you can also use tcpshield for ddos protection(also a free service)
