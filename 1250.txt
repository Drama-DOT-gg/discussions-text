WIRELESS-MONEY-PHONE-REPAIRS - DISCLAMER: This thread's purpose is to talk about this host's unprofessionalism, and not to completely end the host itself. 

Hey! Today I would like to show you all some info about listed.host, a few months old host that should be about to "re-release". I would like to talk about the unprofessionalism of this hosting provider. They have been promising multiple times to re-launch, for then just pinging everyone and saying that they’re sorry. One of the owners, Xcyth, just keeps confirming that he is a full stack dev and more cool things, but at the same time WHOOPS! He just completely wiped an entire dedicated server with users data! And he obviously says that there wasn’t much data on it anyways, yeah just like saying who cares…
This data loss affected me and I don’t want you guys to be one of the future victims of this host: WATCH OUT!
So yeah, after this happened they have been promising to re-launch for months, without doing anything. I remember that they had a bot, but for some reason Xcyth decided to ditch it and make one (and after 3 months it’s not ready yet, what a slow full stack developer….)
Here is all the proof you guys need, have a wonderful day! - https://i.imgur.com/B411ZtN.jpg

FlyingMane - This is not unprofessionalism. If you don't have a backup system you are not allowed to have servers and a server host. This is a serious deal
shaunthesheep - Don't rely on others for your backups its simple lmao
