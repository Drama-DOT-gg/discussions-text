MaiDub - I was traveling looking for some host that is blessed well done, and I found this, I do not know if to name it host or just a hobby, we started with a complete disorganization, channels with emojis, other unicodes other alone, what the hell did you decide, besides that, literally no They give you an answer, there is only one creator DianixGTX # 2347 and two moderators, who seem to not even know what the hell the server is about, I was asking something simple and they do not give an answer, I imagine if someone buys, how long does it take them? and after investigating his chat, guess what, I found a person complaining that he had a day without answer and without data that he bought his vps.
