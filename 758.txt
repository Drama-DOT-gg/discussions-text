Cheese MCM theme:

He kept saying that the theme is fully modified now and that they've bought cheese. They literally changed some colors and layouts and called it fully modified. What do you mean fully modified if the sidebar, the main point of the cheese theme is still there, with just some news icons and a non-color instead of yellow?

Today, they've told me that they fully reworked the panel.

It's still the same theme, but they've changed one part from it and they call it 100% new. Modifying one thing is not going to make it 100% new.

Now they're saying that the old theme doesn't exist anymore, so they can protect themselves and they say that it doesn't matter because they changed the code from it. I'm sorry but I'm not the one who is flexing with a stolen idea.

The main problem isn't that they've used the theme or edited it, the problem is that they called it 100% edited and that nothing was left in there from it. If it was 100% edited, as this is how you presented it, why was the sidebar still in there without any other modifications than the color and the icons? Also, please stop flexing with your landing page. It's so generic that everyone can say that they've seen something similar like it before.


Let's get over the theme part.


Someone in the server () said if we can give him DMS with invites of hosts which sell VPSes and dedicated servers, so I've told him about System413, because they are cheap, and at that time, I wanted to get a VPS from them. Here's Vanquish trying to compete with sys413, but he doesn't own any IRL server/node. 



I'm sorry, you're trying to compete with sys413 but you still didn't finish ur landing page...?



So let me understand if you sell Minecraft servers on a node from OVH or Hetzner it gonna make your host better? Then get ready to throw off your dedicated servers and rent some from Hetzner/OVH!


I'm curious about their VPS prices, I mean, they're trying to compete with sys413 but the biggest VPS they can offer it's an AMD Ryzen 5 3600 with 6 vCores and 32 GB ram...

The problem is not with the other staff members from there, only with Mackabu and Vanquish, as they're the 2 guys which say that what they do it's totally new and that they're better than sys413 (which comes out from Vanquish comportment in the conversation about system413) - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-02/1625258983-623087-captura-de-ecran-din-2021-07-02-la-234937.png

TMKC - Hello. I am one of the directors for Gamespeed / GameSRV.

I can not either confirm or deny the "accusation" of modifying a theme. I am not involved in the development of the game panel,  However I've seen Mackabu code the thing a fair bit.  I can beleive it is custom coded, but I can not be sure about that.

As far as I know with sys413, they DO use Hetzner, but they colo with them. They have their own hardware just colo it in a Hetzner datacenter.  At least they did that last time I checked. I might be wrong.

GSRV has been "under maintnance" for quite a while.  We picked the domain "gamesrv.io" because "gamespeed.com, net, org" etc was taken and there where no sites on them.  GameSRV seemed to be the best option at the time.


I will take distance for the topic related to "sys413 is better than ovh and hetzner" and all that stuff.  I do not agree on that part.
I can just speak from my experience. I never used sys413, so I do not know how their things are working or the performance of their hardware.  I use OVH and Hetzner.  OVH is better than Hetzner in my opinion.  I can not and will not speak about sys413 since I never used them.
samxd - TMKC I do understand your concern on the fact that GSRV has been under maintenance for some time, which is around two weeks. However, this does not mean it is "dead" as your co worker has claimed. GSRV will be back in operation with a registered trademark once we have purchased and colocated owned hardware. Thank you for understanding - Sam.
jeekie - In my opinion, neither company (ovh and hetzner) is "better". They both offer reliable products with high uptime and easy to use control panels. 

While yes, ovh has better DDoS protection, this is also reflected in pricing, and ddos protection can be easily setup with a gre tunnel / proxy solution. And on hetzners side, you get better hardware at lower prices.

If you buy a hetzner cloud VPS, they actually seem to have better protection than hetzners dedis, which is the opposite of ovh, but that may just be my experience.

Basically - imo neither company is better, they both have their ups and downs.
TMKC - samxd 
I do understand completely.
GSRV and GameSRV are "two different things".  Our company is called "Gamespeed", but we just use GameSRV.io as the domain name itself.

And as I stated before, I am not trying to defend my co-workers in any way.  I am just trying to defend Gamespeed as a company.  Nothing more, nothing less.
samxd - TMKC Absolutely, and I do appreciate your level of maturity unlike your co-worker.
TMKC - samxd I am simply just trying to defend the company's reputation.
I will not stand behind my co-workers stupid comments and how they act, ut I'd hate to see the company go to hell just because 2 people can't keep their mouth shut and know when to step down and back away.

If we'd infringe on your company at all, please contact me at TMKC#2536 on Discord and we can work something out that suits the both of us.
luffyy - mituishere I can confirm that they did not copy cheese theme
luffyy - Firstly cheese theme is made from a youtube tutorial
luffyy - It's sidebar is everywhere over the Internet and a menu like that is really common
luffyy - In the console page you can see how mackabu changed the graphs layout this would have been hard to do if he had not developed the sidebar himself
Deleted User - TMKC Nooooom you didn't understand anything from what I've said.

So:
They compared themselves with System413
The point of that argument was that they were trying to compare themselves with system413 but gamespeed doesn't have no owned hardware IRL. The joke I've made in there was about everyone to throw their owned hardware and to go rent servers from OVH and Hetzner .

The theme design is stolen from MC-Market, and they claim that it's totally new and the theme they've made before it's totally modified and nothing like the MC-Market theme.
Deleted User - luffyy They said by themself that they took the code and modified it. The point is that Vanquish was flexing with a theme that was FULLY MODIFIED, but after 6 minutes of conversation, he went to 99%, and then he went to 90%. I mean, I'm sorry, can't he just choose a number? He went from 100% modified to 90% modified in only 5 minutes. Even if they've made it by themselves, you can't call that original as it's super generic, like their landing.
luffyy - The theme they currently have with a sidebar and a top bar is different from the mc market theme
luffyy - The theme might not be unique since its a common design but as far as we know the theme could be custom made
Deleted User - luffyy I'm talking about the old one, which they claimed that it's 100% modified, and then, in 5 minutes, from 100% went down to 90%.
luffyy - mituishere I mean it can be based of it but we can never be too sure. but by looking at the themes they look very similar
Deleted User - luffyy They admitted that they've removed some code in it, but if I wasn't going to say anything, I can bet that he was still going to say that he 100% made it or 100% modified it.
eraters - TMKC As far as I know with sys413, they DO use Hetzner, but they colo with them. They have their own hardware just colo it in a Hetzner datacenter.  At least they did that last time I checked. I might be wrong.

what i dont understand is that you bought gamesrv.io instead of gamespeed.io, which is available
Deleted User - eraters primesrv also :kekw:
Lucas - Let me get this straight, you hoaxed a host that has not released yet over a pterodactyl theme which argument you lost.

😆
Lucas - mituishere at no point did we compare ourselves to system413 as we haven't even released fully yet
Deleted User - Lucas If I decided to bring everything in here doesn't mean that I lost an argument LMFAO (Mostly just you crying because you can't reply to anything for that). Also, I am not the one which said that their panel theme is 100% modified and went down to 90% in 5 minutes.
Lucas - also this "theme" in question has been removed completely and remade (not as a result of this thread but because the code was horrifying we decided to remake it from scratch using no trace of the "cheese theme"
Deleted User - Lucas You still decided to claim that it's 100% modified, and then from 100%, u went to 90%. Also, please read the whole thread.
Lucas - mituishere totally new and that they're better than sys413 (which comes out from Vanquish comportment in the conversation about system413)

can you show when we said we're better than sys413 or any other company?
Deleted User - Lucas You literally started mocking sys413 for selling 64GB ram VPSes.
Lucas - mituishere okay? it's a pterodactyl theme which is now gone, forever and will never see the light of day again. our new theme contains no trace of that horrid cheese theme.
Lucas - mituishere mocking? how so?
Deleted User - Lucas  I'm sorry, you mocked them for not being the cheapest. As I said: sys413 is the cheapest and then you said Nah. But here's one question, can you tell me the price for that 32gb ram VPS plan which you're selling?
Lucas - mituishere our plans are not firm at this point in time, we haven't even opened our doors fully. at no point did I compare ourselves to sys413 a much larger and more developed provider nor will I do so now.
Deleted User - Lucas 

our new theme contains no trace of that horrid cheese theme.
  
  yes, it's so horrid that you even bought it, used it and then tried to claim that you've made it
Deleted User - Lucas You literally said no like your host is way cheaper, as every time when u come and we're talking about hosts, you need to come and "promote" gamespeed. One time you even talked like you we're doing colocation when u weren't - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-04/1625414736-413415-image.png
theMackabu - mituishere we bought it not considering the screenshots might not provide enough info, after some research we discovered the original author wasnt the person selling on pterodactyl market even. About a week after purchasing it, I was so annoyed at the fact that it was so poorly made, that I changed my mind and decided on just wiping the dev vps and starting fresh.
Lucas - mituishere I bought it for the sidebar, even when purchasing it I was in complete disgust lol. 

now our theme uses 0% of either cheese or the reworked "based" cheese theme's code however the generic sidebar design can "resemble" the one from cheese but again it contains 0% of the code



and at no point did we compare ourselves to sys413 or any related entity therefore this thread should be resolved. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-04/1625414879-88906-image.png
theMackabu - I will now be using a git diff to compare the codes, one sec while I make a repo with commits
Deleted User - Lucas Everything about this thread was about the way you've acted about the old theme, as I don't see saying anything bad about this new theme. I just said about this theme that's the almost same concept/design but changed one thing. I don't really have any issues with this as long as it's getting fully recoded, and it's not bought from MCM and claimed that you made it or that you 100% modified it.
theMackabu - Between cheese, and the theme, there are almost zero files about the navbar that are similar during a code compare - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-04/1625415445-110720-image.png
Deleted User - theMackabu About the new theme and cheese I was talking strictly about the design.
theMackabu - mituishere I still dont see how the designs are even remotely similar
Deleted User - theMackabu Sorry, I mean the old cheese modified theme and this one
luffyy - wait so this thread is about a pterodactyl theme?
Deleted User - Unprofessional: Impersonating


Just imagine what people from their host saw when he had that name and photo - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-05/1625487972-498093-captura-de-ecran-din-2021-07-05-la-152608.png
Lucas - mituishere how does this have any relation to the main point of the thread
Deleted User - Lucas The whole thread is about you being unprofessional, as you started impersonating people, and also claimed that you modified a theme by 100% and then claimed 99% and after that 90%
JAY - why's it spicy! 😆
