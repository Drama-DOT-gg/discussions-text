Jedrik - So they offer free hosting for invites

they're probably gonna end up selling the server if they get enough people, what do you think about this? - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-11-06/1604658454-703746-image.png
HCS - They use the old wh logo?
Jedrik - HCS It isn't even an original logo so we can't really say they used the wh logo
Tomas - Awfully scummy looking, owner cannot even setup a Discord correctly.
Saqib - Send their discord. And yeah probably going to get sold.
Jedrik - Saqib https://discord.gg/cEGprj8fd2
Saqib - As tomas said it looks very scum. No chat or anything, seems like one of those scam paypal and nitro reward servers. Probably a scam but dunno. Now this is definitley going to get sold.
shrunkiequack - the owner deleted his account/got termed. good for him
