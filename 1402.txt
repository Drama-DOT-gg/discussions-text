TMKC - OBYCANOB You think you're smart, Jay?
You are the only one that calls my country "switzerland", when I am from SWEDEN.
And you and Sydney are the only people who know my exact address.

It is also ILLEGAL to share someone's home address without their concent:

(i know the link says DevianArt, but the law is still the same)
TMKC - Lets try to debunk this real quick here.....
Switzerland? Nope, I'm from Sweden
Faking illnesses? What? I legit have cancer, going to chemo to get rid of it (hopefully)
Selling nulled products?  What where you smoking when you wrote that?
Leaking my address? Are you dumb? Sharing someone's address without the person's concent is ILLEGAL.
Sydney - TMKC When did u give me ur address.... I might be brain dead, but I can't remember that... Unless it was in an account, and even then
