SpadeSl - BlackCat Update 2021 9/3/2021 
i've taken full control of Gl0ckNodes and renamed it to OptiMaze.Java how i got full control is when i trademarketed the name glock nodes first as Glock didnt care about trademarketing it allowing me to sue him for Trademark European Union Breach and Shutting down the name under my brand
IoNetty - SpadeSl I can help maintain it if you want, I got some time on my hands. Can't promise anything though. I'm willing to help if needed. ðŸ™‚
IoNetty - Note: I haven't fully read the thread, just a nice person.
IoNetty - Nevermind.
Ptero - he never trademarked 2Gl0ck1Nodes he just trademarked 2Gl0ckNodes1 and i just trademarked 2GL0ck1Nodes So yeah...
SpadeSl - Ptero Dumbass doesnt realize LikeSac also trademarketed all the bypasses just incase we missspell your shitty name
