Tomas - it just seems like they don't know how to run it, that's all
EmeraldMike - Tomas yeah that's the main thing
i haven't been able to see the actual servers themselves
Iceey - Terms of Service is void, people need to realize having a ToS doesn't mean it works, they may be void and therefore not enforceable at all, and furthermore not a ToS.

Privacy Policy is as well, I suggest changing this before the EDPS is on your ass. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-02-16/1613490073-753555-image.png
EmeraldMike - Iceey not my host
Also, you seem very good with legal stuff.
ThatTom - EmeraldMike I agree with most points but how could you comment on the servers when you have said you didn't try them?
Two - This doesn't seem that bad. Maybe, you can remove "hilarious performance" because you didn't provide any proof on how it has a bad performance.
Reddog2904 - EmeraldMike Could you please explain to me what is wrong with using a WHMCS theme and if you are not talking about that then please explain to me what template you are referring to. The game servers were not in the full release as they were in BETA which is made very clear to you especially as I believe you are in the Discord. They were never linked to by us officially and where never listed on the main categories on the front page until fully released, as such the only way you could have really known about them was is if you explored the website extensively or were linked to it in the BETA program provided by us.

We had two weeks in early February when the sponsorships incoming were far outnumbered those we could accept at the time so we gave them 2 simple option the first of which was they could close the ticket and either try again another day or go to someone else, the second of which was to wait in a clearly stated queue that was referenced by a message sent to all of them individually.

We stated that the more sponsorships we have the better simply because any business will tell you that more general exposure be that in the form of a sponsorship in this case is generally a good thing.

The sponsorship manager is there to keep track of the sponsors in the queue and as such they are responsible for giving people the unfortunate news that they cannot be accepted at this time.


The rules are there as stated because staff members were complaining that their time was being wasted by people who open tickets as a troll and they would far rather use that time to help people who genuinely need help.


We request that all members speak in English in the public channels as explained in the channel description as we can only provide higher technical support and talk to those we can speak the same language, this is also for moderation purposes as we need to speak the same language to understand what people are saying. Some staff members do occasionally translate for us however this is only upon request.

If you have anything else you would like an explanation on then please feel free to discuss this in a ticket within the Discord server you are currently still a part of.
Reddog2904 - EmeraldMike We do not allow Trainee support to gain access to any servers that customers rely on due to possible complications because trainees may cause server failure or a GDPR violation. After a review of our records, I don't think you ever had access to any of our services and as such, you would not have been able to make a fair judgement or review of the performance of our servers. So I don't understand why you tagged this thread with "Hilarious Performance".
Reddog2904 - Iceey would you mind kindly explaining to us what in that paragraph voids it as that would be greatly appreciated to understand?
EmeraldMike - Fuck I forgot I made this lmao
ThatTom - @Jedrik mhm, and why did you add the illegal Activity tag? Nothing here seems illegal.
EmeraldMike - Reddog2904  yes i know that i ment at the time there was no way for me to test lmao
Reddog2904 - EmeraldMike Alright and could you please explain to me what makes our services "Bad Services"?
Reddog2904 - @Jedrik May I ask what "Illegal Activity" you are referring to?
eraters - Reddog2904 that's a catagory, website-law complience is under illegal activity
Reddog2904 - eraters Regardless could you please explain in what way it is illegal?
Reddog2904 - Iceey This has since been fixed I think.
Iceey - Reddog2904 Send me your legal documents and I'll tell you what's void.
Reddog2904 - Iceey The legal documents are on the following website: https://springnodes.com/terms-conditions/ Any help if there is an issue would be appreciated.

Iceey - ALTERATIONS TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS

These terms are blatantly generated, they don't regulate the use of the services in regards to hosting, you need to prohibit certain things which the law requires you to. the Prohibited Use section only enforces the website's prohibited use, and wouldn't be sufficient for hosting, different sector different requirements.

Cited is Introduction, Sec 1).
"Please read these terms and conditions carefully, as they affect your legal rights. Your agreement to comply with and be bound by these terms and conditions is deemed to occur upon your first use of our Products or Services"

They aren't bound by anything, the contract can't be enforced and you may be dealing with adolescents, depending on the governing factor.

Cited is Limitation of Liability, Sec 31.2)
"2.     loss or corruption of any data, database or software;"
  
 
Depending on the citizenship of your client(s); the location of registration and governing, by any organization within the agreement, are there specific laws for the aforecited. As an example is the Information Commissioner's Office of the UK which sets specific regulations on dataloss and breaches, within, to and or by companies operating in the UK. You must report a breach within 72 hours of occurrence, and believe me, you will be liable. Furthermore by the EEA citizenship, if may be, of one client of yours are you required to follow and enforce the GDPR, which by Article 24, the first section. (Art. 24.1,1) states;

"Taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risks of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure and to be able to demonstrate that processing is performed in accordance with this Regulation."

And by Article 32, first section, point b. (Art. 32.1 b.);

"the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services;"

And by Article 33, the first section and including both subsections. (Art. 33.1,1);

"1. In the case of a personal data breach, the controller shall without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, notify the personal data breach to the supervisory authority competent in accordance with Article 55, unless the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. 2. Where the notification to the supervisory authority is not made within 72 hours, it shall be accompanied by reasons for the delay."
  
 Cited is Your rights, Sec 19)
 
 As your contract is governed by the United Kingdom the ICO, aforedefined, to do business within the UK whereby you collect, store, process or share data are you required to state an office of a Data Protection Officer or DPO. The DPO should not intervene with regular contact details, as they're of the upmost confidentiality and information shared by the parties (DPO and enquirer) should not be collected and processed as per the standard of normally obtained data. The DPO may receive from the enquirer request of right utilization by the UK GDPR, GDPR, CCPA or any of the sort, and he must provide a form or something of template to fill with accurate information and proof to confirm identity and act upon the enquirer's request. SEE GPDR ARTICLES 12-23
 
 NOTE
 
 Although there may be errors here, I see that you are generally trying to operate a legitimate business, that doesn't mean the thread should be closed, but this seems to be going in the right direction. 
 
 I also may add something about your privacy policy and or other legal documents.
