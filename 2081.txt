Tomy - I asked a couple of questions about whether the company is registered because they make money from it, I also tried to find out where the company is registered, what was the answer... - https://i.imgur.com/YjC8988.png

Gamer3514 - Tomy that is just a paid pterodactyl panel addon
Gamer3514 - The payment methods they probably accept are stripe and PayPal. I donâ€™t believe they need to share the documents with you, a random discord user
Aplimmm - Im pretty sure there is nothing wrong with earning money and not being a registered buissness (correct me if im wrong). And there is no proof of any illegal activity at any of your screenshot. And on your screenshot its just say that you are asking if they are a registered buissness or not so if they are not you will registered it for them, and i understand why they dosent want to say if they are registered or not like bro who want a random dude from discord to registered their buissness
Jen - Aplimmm technically depending on each country if u earn below a certain amount per month then you don't have to be a registered business
Arkhan_Old_Acc_Deleted - "The Panel of your dreams powered by a Open Source Software and a paid Addon to steal your money and make it look Different." ElectroNode. Stupidity at it's highest.
Arkhan_Old_Acc_Deleted - Jen You need to pay tax and register atleast a Single Person Company or whatever it is called. For us in Germany you need to sign up a "Gewerbe" to earn anything, after that you are officially registered as "Einzelunternehmen/Einzelunternehmen".
