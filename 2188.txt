xD-UrDaD - So I got this thread https://drama.gg/d/1281-xite-nodes-scam-overloaded-nodes-abusing-free-trials-ddosing-other-hosts

and its tried Exposed XiteNodes's Scam
it didn't prooved it completly a scam
i am still doubting if they are still scamming the same it as almost 3 years
isupportnolg - ohh yeah xitenodes is still scamming life for real
they had dataloss 20 times in 2023 and still having ongoing dataloss becuase they use oracle free nodes which obviously makes data go away! i tired of this shit dude! #closexite
isupportnolg - like get some life xite owner! and one more thing whmc free trial they are using
xD-UrDaD - Okay thats suprising if they were this long and still Running and Got Good SEO
approved by Stripe , PhonePE and CC Avenue thats wired
isupportnolg - because of constant datalosses other owner even left xite
isupportnolg - xD-UrDaD everything is lie or fake
xD-UrDaD - isupportnolg their website have Stipe integrated and PhonePE not sure about CC Avenue tho
isupportnolg - xD-UrDaD first of all billing panel is down
xD-UrDaD - as much as i know PhonePE does and CC Avenue Does a pretty good background Research before approving
isupportnolg - and there everything is down 90% of the time and even they have indian nodes but still you will get high ping
isupportnolg - xD-UrDaD they have verything fake
xD-UrDaD - isupportnolg its up for mee
https://billing.xitenodes.com/
isupportnolg - xD-UrDaD they did right now it will do down in some hours again
xD-UrDaD - isupportnolg thats wired if they are actally indian nodes they should have good pings
isupportnolg - xD-UrDaD i know
PadowYT2 - xD-UrDaD then fucking provide proof? not make a thread linking to an another 2y thread with literally saying "maybe they are still scamming, idk üëâÔ∏èüëàÔ∏è"
xD-UrDaD - PadowYT2 i made this tread to know if they are still scamming

becuz asking things like Invoice and other makes no sence at this point of time we know their are a lot of AI that can be used to fake it 
and their Owner Mr.Shadow is Kinda Scary  in faking things
PadowYT2 - xD-UrDaD you don't make a thread asking - https://drama.gg/d/2158
ast3risk - @xD-UrDaD Nice word salad spelling by the way.
isupportnolg - xD-UrDaD arent u the owner of xitenodes?Admin please block this thread and dont let it bumb
xD-UrDaD - isupportnolg no i am not ofc
xD-UrDaD - isupportnolg do i look like a owner of xitenodes why the fuck i will create thread on my self them
flaxeneel2 - oh, xitenodes. the same one as this? (drama.gg thread that i commented on)

I didn't really look into it a whole lot recently, but back then, just them cracking whmcs, usinc OCI, etc. was a huge red flag. I don't know if its the same people as before or if its somene else using the same name (cuz lets be honest, most hosts like these suck at naming lol), but i wouldn't go near em
