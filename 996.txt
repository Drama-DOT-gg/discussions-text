tan_playz - can someone suggest me some real cheap vps? something like 1$/1GB ram atleast, not vps's like 100$/6GB ram lol

if anyone know pls do tell me

ya btw I already know contabo but I'm searching for more
Deleted User - depends if your looking for actual enteprises such as DO,AWS,Linode,Azure,Vultr,Hetzner,cantabo 
they wont be so cheap 
But for the small ones i bet there are many but they are not as secure and at any time may go poof without a refund
Deleted User - Zachery tho small ones are at most times " cheap"
Scripted - I can sell VPS(ES) from hetzner for cheap.
1$/GB
Scripted - can do 0.50$/GB too
awsamboi - Scripted what is your website?
Grabstop - tan_playz if you join my host, CelestialHosting from https://discord.gg/Qc9jjhgX
I can assist you with our really cheap plans!
tan_playz - Grabstop uhuh no, I'm not going to purchase 3rd party stuff on discord lol I only purchase stuff from legit companies that actually have a billing area. Who knows if you aren't scamming
eraters - tan_playz buy a raspberry pi
GamerOmega - tan_playz you can try nextarray, https://nextarray.com
its pretty cheap
Chirag - GamerOmega better use buyvm, it's better not that expensive
TME - Scripted Try using crycloud or ghosty, they are pretty good. I use linode for a webserver tho because I need the speed (very good speeds on linode, even tho they have an epyc cpu). Also if you go for ghosty or crycloud, try going for a plan above budget. Performance will increase 10 fold, also budget is good if you want a vps for testing. Make a note that I have used both these services in the past and they have a very nice staff team too

Ghosty - http://billing.ghosty.host/aff.php?aff=48

Also these are my affilate links xd. Please use them ðŸ™‚
Dubs - TME hetzner.
Giyu - Dubs hetzner is not a cheap vps hosting platform
Giyu - go with ghosty, contabo, or buyvm ig. i personally hates crycloud
Dubs - Giyu it is tho.. not cheap but they do vps lol
_MrKnight_ - I'm talking about cheap they do provide cloud servers but it is not cheap
FatGrizzly - just use buyvm or nexusbytes
FatGrizzly - even https://racknerd.com/ryzen-vps is better
Iceey - https://careers.mcdonalds.com/main/ - get a job
eraters - TME CryCloud

funniest joke i ever seen
Courvix - Hetzner absolutely is cheap



Lightsail is a cheap AWS option at $3.5 for the cheapest plan. You can also get fairly cheap EC2 instances on an ARM CPU which will give you 2 cores and 1GB of RAM with a gigabit uplink for about $3-$4 monthly, though it may not be compatible with everything out there.

Grabstop - tan_playz itâ€™s on our website https://celestialhosting.xyz
Tomas - Grabstop bro wtf is that

xyz domain?? website poorly made?? fade takes forever??
Robert - Grabstop That does not look trustworthy at all.

I'd just suggest getting a Hetzner Cloud VPS or something, or, if you can't afford it just get a job.
Tomas - Robert ^^^

Grabstop Why on earth is the node on a home network?
Grabstop - Tomas Sorry, Haven't had that before at all. 

The XYZ domain was because .com was already taken and .net is incredibly overpriced.
Since when have people been complaining about paid domains?

@Robert It's my host and I trust it (why wouldn't I), the website is being reworked from when it was originally released it was from a Fiverr freelancer. Additionally, getting a job is easier said than done from where I live.
Tomas - Grabstop considering the domain was taking, have you ever considered that there also may be another "company" operating under the same name and you should possibly use a different name?

also your opinion would obviously be biased, i'd assume most owners of 'hosts' think their host is the best and most trustworthy
tan_playz - Grabstop wheres the vps?
Grabstop - tan_playz not on the billing panel yet, will be up within 2-4 days (had to take down to get virtualizor
)
tan_playz - Grabstop ok I'll be waiting, hopefully your vps is actually affordable
