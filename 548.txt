Ryan - Hello 
a new freehost opened up called MultyHost owned by manouelツ#1398  and Jaiden#6969
first of all lets start by pointing out that they are using a freenom domain .tk to be exact

next how Jaiden is disrespectful and unprofessional 

she even banned manouel for adding a new rule , she added him back but like banning him in the first place was a mistake 

next i got banned with no reason on my main account when i asked her about the reason in my alt she said the following : 

last thing their using a free dashactyl theme on their host , like using a free theme is fine but they changed the footer the theme was made by Arpan Sen#7114, and the changed it to the following:

manouel - it was for something else to and .tk domain i cant understand why we cant use free domain and why did u use alts i think u broke tos
manouel - and she wasnt diserspectful at first yes but after she realized it was bad and she stopped
manouel - what why u arent talking
Jaiden - Well i mean you call me disrespectful i cant really controll that because i have a 
personality disorder
Ryan - Jaiden i dont wanna sound mean or anything , but i dont have much knowledge on personality disorder so i won't take that as a valid excuse. if u think it is then it is , the community will judge
Jaiden - Ryan A personality disorder is a condition that affects how you think, feel, behave or relate to other people.
manouel - ok question we free host we give free servers why cant we use a free domain
Tomas - send doctor's note
manouel - and this thing cant be little controlled like she can not to talk to much in chat
eraters - manouel Freenom is well known for making your domain redirect to a porn site.
Ryan - Jaiden ik that , okey do what tomas said a prescription or something
manouel - eraters i see but we would never do this
eraters - You aren't freenom, so you can't decide whether your free domain turns into a porn site or not.
manouel - anyways we just opened give us change to show we can change things about domain it  will be little hard now
manouel - eraters wait they do it automatically
manouel - ok so basically we will change domain when we can for sure
Ryan - manouel yes for some domains , how d o you think they earn money
Jaiden - Ryan wdym? i dont care about money
manouel - so im getting a domain waiting to sent me email to accept and after i can use it

Murpled - Why is multyhost offline?
AlphaKennyBody - Welp I have many things to add now . Multy host is nothing but a scam . A good friend of mine 'Sid is Live YT ◥▶_◀◤'#2955 is a bot developer and owner of Jericho and i provide him hosting for that . Here are some stupid messages sent by Rehhann to Sid .




The server is now renamed as Flash host (still no tos tho) and from above i can clearly tell that Rehhann just wanted to get as much money as possible and just flee away . Buying a scam server and redesigning it to make it better , i don't think people are gonna trust it now , even if they do trust a server like that they might get in huge trouble . But my host ( G-HOST ) was accused for no reason . It was my friend so he still trusts me but i don't think these scammers are worth using discord... - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-13/1623566173-597829-image.png

SidisLiveYT - AlphaKennyBody  Yeah ! Noobest Owner of all !!
NotPark - The best Scammer ever !!!
Yie - AlphaKennyBody "wow your bot has no tos thats illegal" says the motherfucker that runs hosting illegally 🤷
HarryW - AlphaKennyBody FlashHost has new owners and we are hoping that FlashHost will provide a fresh new start. The reason for the No TOS is because we do not have any services for sale yet.
_MrKnight_ - rehann be like , oh lord discord pls sue jericho for all sins that bot did , for all "fake" nsfw it posted ~ amen
AlphaKennyBody - Yie yeah lol
AlphaKennyBody - HarryW BUT what about the damage and impact ???
SidisLiveYT - _MrKnight_ he got feared when i tried to expose him in server
_MrKnight_ - Is it a he or a she?
SidisLiveYT - Reply when I told him about his partner as both were owners of the host ! They don't give a think or care about user data at all nor their privacy ! And I guess planning to create another scamming host ! huh !
UserID = 639537967655944196

 Btw as My Main account was Banned so had to dm him from alt ! - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-13/1623571003-870126-quack2.png
SidisLiveYT - _MrKnight_ she i guess
_MrKnight_ - Lmao if I see that women I will laugh to death rightnow lol
SidisLiveYT - _MrKnight_ Lol
_MrKnight_ - This hosting platform is getting overrated, kindly stop this and make some ecommerce website or some blogs and add ads in It I'm getting pissed by seeing a lot of hosting scammers rightnow
SidisLiveYT - _MrKnight_ lol again
HarryW - AlphaKennyBody Jaiden owns the nodes and would not let me have access to the nodes. Trust me if I could recover everyones data I would
