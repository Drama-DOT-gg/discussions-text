MrRin - Don't like posting here unless necessary, I'd say now is one of those times.
There's a few people involved here, try your best to keep up.
Poly is one of our ex staff members. A few of you may know them, I don't wish to go into details about why they were removed but they were a bit ago.
They'd been actively trying to contact me and I had been ignoring them as I had no interest in talking to them.
They ended up contacting another of our management (The Untracable) saying this:


We dug through audit logs as a precaution and noticed something strange.

One of our ex-head admins deleting invite tracking things. (Demoted to trial admin yesterday due to some internal issues.)

Asked poly what was going on and got this:


Poly for some reason told me about one of the ways they'd try to do some of the things they were attempting to do:


Not too much longer after this, I received a dm from skittle...



Began to actually believe skittle here (bad idea)
Skittle also sent me this (flashbang warning)



I learnt from Polyanthi that a user called Royalty was involved too. I contacted them threatening to head to the cyber police, this was my largest source of information.

Poly was still somehow involved as Skittle has sent me this too:



Skittle took the bot's token and our mongoDB login, Changed some things around so that people could continue to make unlimited free servers instead of our normal 1 of each type for free.
Also took the token... they planned to give it the mod role which had ban and kick perms and nuke the server. 

Skittle violated our Privacy Policy by accessing the files unauthorized. (Hence the illegal tag)
They were relying on a lot of people for this and I'm greatly disappointed people would stoop this lowly.

There's a hell of a lot more that I haven't screenshotted yet which I'll add later on in the comments.
Some extras I cba to tag:



Also got sent this:

Salty for someone else getting a role LMFAO.
Also edited our staff application form on google to be all about sex! Amazing topic huh

Again, I'll add more shit later when I can be assed to screenshot it all.

They'd been actively trying to contact me and I had been ignoring them as I had no interest in talking to them.
They ended up contacting another of our management (The Untracable) saying this:


We dug through audit logs as a precaution and noticed something strange.

One of our ex-head admins deleting invite tracking things. (Demoted to trial admin yesterday due to some internal issues.)

Asked poly what was going on and got this:


Poly for some reason told me about one of the ways they'd try to do some of the things they were attempting to do:


Not too much longer after this, I received a dm from skittle...



Began to actually believe skittle here (bad idea)
Skittle also sent me this (flashbang warning)



I learnt from Polyanthi that a user called Royalty was involved too. I contacted them threatening to head to the cyber police, this was my largest source of information.

Poly was still somehow involved as Skittle has sent me this too:



Skittle took the bot's token and our mongoDB login, Changed some things around so that people could continue to make unlimited free servers instead of our normal 1 of each type for free.
Also took the token... they planned to give it the mod role which had ban and kick perms and nuke the server. 

Skittle violated our Privacy Policy by accessing the files unauthorized. (Hence the illegal tag)
They were relying on a lot of people for this and I'm greatly disappointed people would stoop this lowly.

There's a hell of a lot more that I haven't screenshotted yet which I'll add later on in the comments.
Some extras I cba to tag:



Also got sent this:

Salty for someone else getting a role LMFAO.
Also edited our staff application form on google to be all about sex! Amazing topic huh

Again, I'll add more shit later when I can be assed to screenshot it all.

MrRin -  - https://i.rin.codes/Discord_4oHrndr0C4.png
MrRin - TLDR: Skittle got demoted whilst another staff was promoted, got salty and got together a group of our current and ex staff. Took our mongodb containing all client stuff for the bot and changed it around so people would get unlimited free servers, also took the token in an attempt to nuke the server. 
Worked with a lot of other people from my staff team who I'll be posting here along with their IDs for you to avoid.
MrRin - 714466395022426172 - Royalty - Coded the nuke bot
903619658232508416 - Skittle122 - Main person behind most of this (Also supported communism judging by the nickname he had for a few months)
873230952820781096 - PolyAnthi - Did a bit too 
701284844600295466 - Infinix - Was in the groupchat, not sure what they did ngl
740906193312284715 - Hidden_Black_ - Same thing
One other who happened to be a donator too, I want to get their side of the story first though.
PolyAnthi - Mmm, my threats weren't necessarily illegal. Was planning to do what you've just done here. Drama.gg. Just to prove how chaotic EpikHost has become and then I was kicked from the Group Chat which had our proof saved so I can no longer make that thread.
MrRin - PolyAnthi Yours weren't illegal, didn't say they were and if I did, I apologise. It was skittle who did the illegal part by breaking the Privacy Policy against us.
PolyAnthi - MrRin Yep. I did advise Skittle to not nuke (that was me) and then I went to watch YouTube thinking Skittle wouldn't do dumb shit and look what I returned to.
PolyAnthi - MrRin Can say this, Infinix did nothing. Didn't see them in the GC at all. I don't really know what I did besides assisting them in resigning and attempting to make drama.gg thread.
MrRin - PolyAnthi Will take that with a grain of salt.
PolyAnthi - MrRin Wouldn't expect anymore.
royaliswifey - tl;dr - nuke didn't happen, was an attempt. no one did really any "illegal" threats, but yeah, ton of drama and theats, gotta admit
MrRin - royaliswifey Stole the mongodb, logged in, changed things, also meant they had access to customer data
PolyAnthi - royaliswifey sounds about right.
 besides ^
royaliswifey - skittle did steal the mongodb url, but he asked me to login and i almost had no clue how to do that XDDDD.
so infact, he has the mongodb url, but didnt make any changes i think
MrRin - royaliswifey He did make changes, I could see haha, He changed the names of the plans because the way the bot coded it didn't check with ptero, just it's local DB, meaning that it would think said person didn't have that plan, allowing them to purchase it again
royaliswifey - that is very surprising, didn't know that..
SpaceDoggo - Skittle is the most immature person I've ever seen, getting salty over me getting promoted, even though both of us has basically the same permissions. Talking in extremely broken English, crying over the role icons.... He just wanted the Co-owner tag but didnt wanna actually contribute anything.  Considering the immaturity, I would say he didn't deserve his current post anyway
I don't think Infinix did anything wrong here.
royaliswifey - can simply agree with 2
PolyAnthi - SpaceDoggo I agree with 2
dabmaster41 - I am going to preface this by saying nuking a server is not illegal.
    &lt;- This is not illegal.
   There is also NO legal binding to EpikHost as a company either.  Anyone could just fucking yoink the name and it's as good as gone.  All the information that was worked with via the panel was either public information or similar in information you could get from GitHub.
   " I contacted them threatening to head to the cyber police, this was my largest source of information." &lt;- The "cyber police" don't get involved in petty shit like this and you of all people should know this. 
   The information Skittle122 used to gather the mongoDB login should be shit that's locked so nobody can willy nilly go into it and give unlimited servers out. That should be a Owner privledge. Along with the roles in EpikHost being absolute fucked beyond belief and nobody seems to care to repare them. Skittle122 may have violated the privacy policy but the thing is you have no legal standing on EpikHost as a company thus this privacy policy is B.S. and void in the court of law.

   Everyone in that entire group chat played a part in this whole shit show. Nobody was innocent and saying all the blame to be on Skittle122 is a load of horse shit. One man does not simply put together a whole nuke/token leak/mongoDB leak. 

     Skittle122 was NOT salty SpaceDoggo got a role. Skittle122 was salty BECAUSE he got a role without doing much as a mod and barely did anything when first promoted because of the perms in the discord server being dogshit and being fucked. It also felt like a stab in the back to the mods who did more then him. I for one feel the same way Skittle122 does. Being head mod and being active 24/7 yet SpaceDoggo goes directly from mod to Co-Owner in a matter of days. Not to mention 90% of the current staff team after the bans handed out by Rin for these actions on this thread, are all underage. Prime example is:
        
   Including the owner himself. Another thing is the second owner, GoldLion, who has been MIA with Covid for a while now, has been shat on by Rin himself multiple times. Even going as far as not caring if he dies in the ICU. Also in which he claimed ownership if Gold does not return.

Discussed this elsewhere, have reason to believe Goldlion was faking it to try get away from us. He'd been acting out for a while before this and was being toxic towards everyone, then randomly disappears and out of nowhere DM's Skittle saying he's in ICU with corona whilst on an alt claiming he's using his dad's phone, which wouldn't be possible as his dad wouldn't be able to visit him.

The information Skittle122 used to gather the mongoDB login should be shit that's locked so nobody can willy nilly go into it
Locked behind panel perms which as you as a staff member know, we restricted a fair amount and will be replaced with restrikt which you also know about.

Skittle122 was NOT salty SpaceDoggo got a role
Screenshot said different, Space was doing more behind the scenes that you guys wouldn't have known about as it was mostly financial side etc.
Hidden_Black_ - MrRin lol I just stood their shitposting
would like to add up the fact that 90% time I was in school , my exams are starting soon so no much time for discord
SpaceDoggo - dabmaster41 Just because you think i'm doing nothing doesnt mean it, we were really really close to shutting down epikhost because of finances, i fixed that (atleast temperorily), I made the website, twitter, reddit, etc.

you did a good job as a mod, sure, but just being online and stuff doesn't make you more or less worthy, that's rin's lookout

Speaking of GoldLion, even Skittle told me that goldlion is definitely lying and stuff, it's not only rin. i would send proof if messages weren't deleted because of ban

I request you to kindly send us the payments you received through Crypto. That money is hard-earned and just running away with is super unethical.
dabmaster41 - SpaceDoggo Your'e really thinking I would just leave with the 6 dollars.....
And yes. It's only 6 bucks and MOST is in satoshi.
dabmaster41 - dabmaster41 It wouldn't even be 6 bucks for you because two dollars get taken off from coinbase and paypal and THEN transferring satoshi takes half.
royaliswifey - MrRin tbh it was quite rude as a company "owner" to say that considering that the message was later deleted. On second thoughts, you yourself are a bit rude with an "owner", and you just gotta admit it. That too, I solely think that the demotion of staff just because they had communist tag was unnecessary, you could infact right click the staff and "CHANGE NICKNAME" and DM the guy instead of removing the role? Didn't you know that it exists? O_O
Skittle_Skittle1 - SpaceDoggo aw see yourself in the mirror first 🙂
 🪞
MrRin - royaliswifey Still not exactly professional for someone to represent my service posing as a communist? I can handle my staff team how I'd like to
royaliswifey - MrRin 
You are not professional, hosts like these can't be professional. But they can be good.
You think that your host is a company. No, try to understand it's not 🙂
You don't handle staff, admins do. And honestly, you handle staff like bs. As a former head admin, I was demoted for "Running helpers", and i don't see the purpose for anyone to be a staff except you if this is the case, simply because all we gonna do is ban and mute, and sometimes, actually, 90%, you demote someone for banning or kicking or warning or WHATEVER. 
You are toxic, not our staff
   Gonna be honest how the hell do you tell your staff to be polite to people who say "fuck you" and then demote them and then ban them a second later for asking why?? and you gotta admit again, you are toxic as hell.
I don't see why you say, "you are getting fired" here, its quite hilarious, considering that none staff gets paid and all profit gets directly on to you and + you probably waste it on other expenses like nitro, and if not nitro, you beg for donors in #news channel.
  this, not only represents epikhost as a broke host, but also, you shouldn't even make a host.
MrRin - royaliswifey Funny how I see a lack of evidence for everything here

You are not professional, hosts like these can't be professional. But they can be good.
  Never said I was a professional, this is my first host and apart from weirdos like you it's going pretty well
  
You think that your host is a company. No, try to understand it's not 
    That's why I call it a service 🙂
    
&gt; You don't handle staff, admins do
  Sorry that I'm an involved owner?
  
  &gt; Gonna be honest how the hell do you tell your staff to be polite to people who say "fuck you" 
    Staff should be able to handle their emotions without losing their shit.
    
    &gt; then ban them a second later for asking why??
      Proof????
  
    &gt; you probably waste it on other expenses like nitro
      Again, proof? All of it goes towards servers and anything else that comes up regarding Epik.
      
      &gt; you shouldn't even make a host.
        Doesn't change the fact that I've started one. If you don't like it, you know where you can go.
        
      This is getting pointless now and is a pure waste of time.
royaliswifey - MrRin you mean, it was a good host, until you messed everything up.
to top that off you're ignoring this thread

Aaron_ - Before I start reading anything, @PolyAnthi did Arc.io get back to you?
royaliswifey - Its quite amusing how the kid got hold of a paypal account and has the license of his so-call "Service".
Doubt you even have it, it's illegal btw x3
Armxxn34 - hi wats dis
yeezy - royaliswifey 
agree
