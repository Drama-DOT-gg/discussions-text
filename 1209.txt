Shershah - ROYADMA_GAMING helllo, first see youself before making thread and that host is not even started?
DeadBush - Shershah if it's not started then why provide services?
DeadBush - And btw WTF is up with these host names fr.
Kowone - DeadBush it's because a kid named it. it's basically "for kids, by kids"
DeadBush - Kowone lmao.
I remember the days when people were too satisfied with our host. We just didn't knew tos and pp is needed and people attacked us lol and plus when we made it. It was in simple language no ober complicated words and straightforward people had problems with that too.
I still get a lot of dms sayin when will netric be back I feel really bad but the money is the problem. the thing is we never used more than 90% ram of any nodes
Razes - L
QloxXy - bruh this mf is staff in my discord...
Tato - QloxXy bruh go away mf, we dont need you
QloxXy - Tato ok failed abortion
Tato - QloxXy  what does that even mean
Shershah - What even 13 year old can make sense?
MayankKumar - Shershah now there host is started and now they sell paid plans on nodes of linode free trial
Aaron_ - MayankKumar Can you send us an invite link
Shershah - ROYADMA_GAMING I could really suggest to see your host first. Your free trail ended then u all stoped hosting lmfao. And who tf said that I gave them nodes lmfao
UnknownTheBestGamer - what the fuck is this?
I started working for this host and I didn't know this post existed
they pay me well and we don't use Linode? or google cloud

free trails cant handle 4 64GB nodes for more than 10 days 

I think this might be an old post but we have satisfied users and that's all that matter üòÉ
also the invite rewards thing is no longer an idea its in the trash
UnknownTheBestGamer - MayankKumar Ummm sorry we don't use Linode?
we are planning on buying a new node from soulnode since they closed down
Jen - UnknownTheBestGamer lmfao soulnodes
U trust that shit company
UnknownTheBestGamer - Razes  hello flamy
Jen - UnknownTheBestGamer yk u can have satisfied users through lies which is normal for a scam host.
Just fix your fucking host or it will get shut down
MayankKumar - UnknownTheBestGamer oh really? i have proof..

i checked your panel and it is hosted on linode
