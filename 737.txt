J0SH - Got banned instantly on join, managed to screenshot the policy channel.




Not sure whether this dm advertiser is an alt or a random person looking for invite rewards.

ByteDev - Uh, we fixed everything my dude...
ByteDev - Also those are inspect eliminated lol...
ByteDev - How unprofessional.
SlayorPlayz - We have made a new one
https://slayhost.xyz/terms.html
Used Elements to fake the "idc" message.
False exposure!
SlayorPlayz - Just mad because our host provides more free resources
Sloth - Y’all can’t even manage to edit a stolen website theme, why would anyone be jealous of a host whose owners are dunces.
Robert - J0SH Why the hell does it store passwords, did these kids not learn anything from Falix's database breach?
BaconHead - Yeah the big companies like facebook don't store passwords in databases
FloopGloop - The panel stores panel passwords lol not discord passwords
Jedrik - FloopGloop No shit sherlock, that's still a huge security risk in the case of a data leak
FloopGloop - We secure our nodes as best as possible so that wont happen
Jedrik - FloopGloop Better safe than sorry
FloopGloop - @Jedrik  It is safe lmao
Jedrik - FloopGloop 🤦
FloopGloop - The reason I banned you J0sh is because your another loser here that exposes people for fake reasons
Robert - FloopGloop "fake reasons" lmao
FloopGloop - who are you guys any way?
FloopGloop - don't you got something else better to do?
FloopGloop - The people in here I see are just failures that try to bring other people down with them...
ByteDev - bruh, Josh was exposed for not using a tos on quackhost when they were starting out...
FloopGloop - ThatGuy, you had your own host... what happend to that? Did you let these losers also bring you down?
BaconHead - Yeah but now they have a ToS and Privacy Policy. Stop playing the blame game, and actually create a Privacy Policy.
FloopGloop - Sloth we just open a nice free host for the public not for you guys to critisize every little thing
FloopGloop - BaconHead WE ALREADY HAVE ONE FOR LIKE 3 DAYS HTTPS://SLAYHOST.XYZ/terms.html
Jedrik - FloopGloop No, I'm taking a break right now

FloopGloop No, not really the site is basically a big disclaimer to avoid specific people or hosts, such as yours, for reasons such as being unprofessional, may have security risks, isrushed, etc.

ByteDev Obviously if you're going to put your host out and public, you have to be ready, legally and technically.
ByteDev - BaconHead AND NOW WE DO.... WE FIXED IT.
BaconHead - FloopGloop It's against data protection laws to collect data without a legally binding privacy policy
FloopGloop - Jedrik Wow are we gonna go to jail for giving away free servers? Yeah right
Robert - FloopGloop I did not have my own host, if you're talking about Easly then you will have to ask ThatGeek about it since I was the CTO, not the owner.
BaconHead - FloopGloop That is a ToS.
FloopGloop - Robert Oof that was my favorite host...
Jedrik - FloopGloop If you're taking it as offensive, you're doing something wrong. Take them as advice, especially as you're still quite fairly new, the information bein cherrypicked about your hosts are from their experience, knowledge and observations. If they're not satisfied, obviously you're doing something wrong.
BaconHead - josh not having a privacy policy at the start of his host doesn't mean that you can run a host without a privacy policy. It may be hypocrisy, but still you must have a privacy policy
FloopGloop - BaconHead Hello Roblox Player
Jedrik - FloopGloop You're handling user data.
BaconHead - FloopGloop When you don't have anything to say, you mock a person for their pfp. And I haven't even played that game since years
FloopGloop - BaconHead You guys just keep on critisizing, your gonna wipe out all free hosts
Jedrik - Being "free" is no excuse, you chose to handle and host their data for free. You're still under legal shit.
FloopGloop - BaconHead your describing yourself for mocking lmao
Deleted User - ByteDev 

Wdym unprofessional LMFAO. You literally typed and changed ur mind 3 times, so u r lying about the inspect element lmfao - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-01/1625141130-159912-captura-de-ecran-din-2021-07-01-la-150525.png

BaconHead - FloopGloop Yeah… No. It's illegal to collect data without a privacy policy, so you're breaking the law and we're doing you a favour by alerting you.
ByteDev - Jedrik We fixed everything before josh posted and then we asked him not to since we had already fixed it but ig he didn't listen..
FloopGloop - we collect discord usernames which u authorize me to by authorizing a discord bot
BaconHead - FloopGloop umm what
BaconHead - FloopGloop Yeah. Discord Usernames STILL COUNT AS DATA. And if you're operating a host, the user will have to upload his files, which belong to him.
ByteDev - mituishere I didn't change my mind three times....
FloopGloop - Discord lets me do it when you authorize me to with the bot
Jedrik - ByteDev Look, I get you fixed the legals and shit, the point I'm trying to get across is:

Storing panel passwords is a major security risk, randomly generated or not


This dumbass won't listen and has his head up his ass
   

I actually haven't seen your privacy policy yet, if you could, please send it here. Thanks! - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-01/1625141287-82607-image.png

Deleted User - ByteDev You literally sent 3 messages with different opinions in them wdym.
FloopGloop - Not a single free host isnt on this website, how sad
FloopGloop - Jedrik  Fine we will try to fix all this
Robert - FloopGloop Because they are all shit and most of them disappear after about a month.
BaconHead - FloopGloop Yeah, because many of the free hosts have been caught doing scummy stuff
Jedrik - Jedrik 

I just realized you had your privacy policy in the picture so, what do you do with the data? why do you collect the data? how do you collect the data? do you share the data with third-parties, etc. That's what we're looking for
FloopGloop - we dont share it whats the use in that??? We use the data so u can log into our panel. We just use a nice discord bot
Jedrik - FloopGloop That's what I like to hear, thank you. Update me personally or everyone on the forum anytime so we can get this sorted.
Jedrik - FloopGloop You still need a privacy policy to state that
BaconHead - FloopGloop Yeah, but the data IS STILL BEING COLLECTED
FloopGloop - Okay so for everything to be fully legal what would I have to do?
FloopGloop - BaconHead The discord bot has it not me
BaconHead - FloopGloop Make a valid privacy policy
FloopGloop - BaconHead Okay how do i do that?
Robert - FloopGloop 🤦
FloopGloop - Robert  lol
SimpSausage - Guys, ima just head over to ByteSyze, cya!
Jedrik - FloopGloop Well, to put it simply, write or buy some legal documents that includes Privacy Policy and Terms of Service, I recommend you write it  your self so you know it by heart and can enforce it effectively. You can read some pre-generated or already existing legal documents and go off of that, but don't completely copy paste it, just take inspiration from it. and Always expect the user to be stupid, basically  let them know everything, where their data goes, how their data is collected, why their data is collected, is their data being shared, what data do you collect, etc.
SimpSausage - Thanks for the feedback, we will keep this in mind!
BaconHead - You can look at other privacy policies (don't copy them, just use them for inspiration like jedrik said) and try to get an idea of privacy policies
SlayorPlayz - Ok, We will update I and we are terribly sorry for mocking you guys
Yie - @SlayorPlayz Is this you? - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-01/1625145569-17904-screenshot-2021-07-01-21-18-26-25.png
SimpSausage - U literally posted that a few days ago... Are you just posting it for attention? Seems like it....
Yie - SimpSausage Who?
J0SH - ByteDev LMFAO
J0SH - Inspect "eliminated" LMFAO
leastile - LMAO
J0SH - ByteDev I posted it before you fixed it, since the child p**n incident, threads must be manually approved by a staff member.
SlayorPlayz - J0SH wtf, you guys should get that person to jail
J0SH - lol what?
Crystal - Hi Josh, I’m the Chief Operator at SlayHost. Thanks for making this thread! If possible I believe I sent it to the correct person. Please could you check your Discord DMs?
J0SH - I've read my dms, no point replying to you
Crystal - J0SH Alright, will talk to those staff and make sure that the database issues are fixed. Sorry for any inconvenience caused and I’ll make sure to tell you when things have been changed.
J0SH - There isn't any database issues, it's just the fact you don't have a privacy policy.
Crystal - J0SH just had a look and didn’t realise that, a proper privacy policy will be out ASAP. Thanks for letting me know. I’m very new to the team so haven’t had too much into that stuff but this will be changed.
Crystal - J0SH A Privacy Policy has been added to our discord T&amp;C. Jedrik
CrypticDev - Slayhost is now ran by new executives. ByteDev is gone and so is FloopGloop and SlayorPlayz.
J0SH - Good to hear.
Crystal - J0SH Would it be possible to take this thread down now as the situation has been handled? Thanks!
J0SH - I can't do that, you'll have to ask @Jedrik or @Sloth to mark it resolved.
SlayorPlayz - Crystal  You shouldn't be so concerned, Its not like there's that many people that check these threads
PrestonJude - These terms of use were created using Termlyâ€™s Terms and Conditions Generator. 

🤦‍♂️
Timanttikuutio - PrestonJude better than nothing. Termly's documents are completely valid and acceptable. everyone should of course make their own, but using termly is fine.
PrestonJude - Timanttikuutio .... They just had to copy and paste something and call it a day, lol
Timanttikuutio - PrestonJude and yet it still a fully valid TOS, shocking...
PrestonJude - Timanttikuutio (â€œyouâ€) and SlayHost ("Company", â€œweâ€, â€œusâ€, or â€œourâ€) #

Ah yes, my fav words
