UnseenAcoustics - Hello Drama.gg,

I was looking for hosting services based on people's status, and I came across a host that I assumed was a cheap 24/7 Iran game hosting which the server name was, so I did some digging and discovered that this is a new discord with no TOS or PP, and have active services.

I took the time to look around the discord and discovered that Dark Hosting has a plans channel, which appears to be quite shady. Take a look at the screenshots below to see for yourself.
