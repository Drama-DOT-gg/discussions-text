J0SH - Elk bewijs?
Justin - Maybe consider talking english here since most people don't understand dutch.
Justin - J0SH Enig bewijs*
Justin - So, you won a bungeecord server, yet you have nowhere to use it on, Prices are determined by them, If they make 3GB more expensive than 3x 1GB thats their choise, so don't judge them for that. So far i don't seem a big issue. And besides using a bungee with external servers isn't the best idea either, but who am i to judge. Also you are acting very disrespectfull towards Damian since their probs just getting into the hosting situation. Calm down a bit here buddy.
Justin - @Robert could you merge these posts?
