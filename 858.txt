Environment - hey all, environment here!
recently, a host named floppa.lol (formely oceaned.host) has popped up. their main dev goes by the name "Floppa" (wow unique right?!). this person has a discord id of 582012181638414357, Floppa#1337


so basically she has claimed to have sexual interaction with her sister, who is 15 (altough i have no real proof on this one, it's just something i heard)

Woosh - environment you got exposed for being a pedophile shut up, she isn't a pedophile lmao nice proof?
auth - Woosh Senser literally said he misunderstood everything and that the claimes he made are not true lol?
Woosh - auth ok then? but there's been more proof since then
auth - Woosh Where
Environment - Woosh if you can even call that proof
if you have read a single bit of the response i wrote in nightrise you would've realized the "proof" you had was invaild
DiscordUser - Look, I can't tell if Floppa or her sister was just doing a joke or its serious.
DiscordUser - If its a joke its a joke you can't just say shit about someone when its a joke if its not then...
Environment - DiscordUser 
(altough i have no real proof on this one, it's just something i heard)

Tbf given how sophie is i wouldn't doubt her doing it
DiscordUser - Environment Ah ok.
DiscordUser - So is floppy.lol is a image host or something?
Environment - DiscordUser it's a hosting provider and a image host, however it seems to be leaning more towards a image host at the moment, they are down rn lol
DiscordUser - Environment  OHHHH was it that host that  was called uhh dream.host
DiscordUser - or something on the lines of dreamed. host
Environment - DiscordUser nope, i don't believe they are related

the host was called oceaned.host and floppa.pics before
DiscordUser - Oh oceaned yes
DiscordUser - But I don't think someone under 18 dating a person that is that is also under 18 or maybe a bit old  aslong its not pedo lines
DiscordUser - I think its wrong buts it on the lines of being a pedo
Environment - DiscordUser sophie is 19 from what i collect
Environment - at least that's what her discord about me says
DiscordUser - I'm not even sure
Environment - DiscordUser https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/869269498786631681/872469830341627985/unknown.png
DiscordUser - Environment  Look if they was in a actual relationship then its a bit worse but if they was just vibin as friends or some shit it isn't as bad
Environment - DiscordUser https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/872436390263152680/872454575586676747/unknown.png
sophie dated you, correct?
yes
Triassic - nice thread title guys
Environment - even if they broke up now, it's still some pedophile that happened, and this is just what I know about, there's nothing to prove that she hasn't done this to other people too
spongibob - Floppa haram pedophile confirmed
Triassic - is their host still a thing?
Woosh - Understandable, have a great day. Owner in question has been removed
slurpee - Environment 
hi yes it is i slurpeemaster we banned the funny person also if anybody reading this has used her bot and given it perms to join servers for them remove it
auth - dont use image hosts in general, why host files on a strangers server?
Triassic - auth wise words, 100% agreed.
Cortex - I was owner of floppa.lol and I regret giving woosh Owner.

I'm going to be honest, Woosh has been giving owner to many people and ones are very toxic, racist, etc.
And I can't believe that one of the owners will do such thing.
I'm sorry for all.
Triassic - just got banned from their discord server for asking them to respond to the allegations on this thread, that kinda confirms everything here in a way tbh.
Triassic - Cortex Really big mistake.
auth - Triassic i got banned for saying "lmfao"
Triassic - auth I saw that happen lmfao, I just thought that you deleted your message and that's all.
Cortex - Also If you used floppa.lol I recommend removing floppa.lol on your connections
Because floppa can make you join servers that can get your discord account termed
Triassic - Cortex damn, would they really do such stuff
Cortex - Triassic I'm not sure, but it can happen.
Triassic - Cortex Why did you even give them ownership in the first place?
Cortex - Triassic It was because I lost motivation on the project, since we don't do progress for so long and also because our backend dev resign. 

EDIT: This is why I give owner to woosh, and woosh was the one that give floppa owner
Triassic - Cortex Yeah but technically, it's your fault that you gave ownership of the project to a bad owner.
Cortex - Triassic Yeah, I know.
I'm sorry.
auth - Triassic I guess he didn't know
Cortex - Mmmm.. https://i.imgur.com/xXlke2b.png
Triassic - Cortex what discord is that in?
Triassic - auth Yeah, but before passing ownership to someone, you should make sure that you know them good enough to know that they'd be able to run something properly as an owner.
Woosh - Ownership was passed to me, i gave owner rank to someone who i shouldn't have and i realize this now.
auth - Triassic He gave it to Woosh tho
Cortex - Triassic Floppa.lol one
spongibob - Woosh Because you are simp sir
Triassic - Woosh So, it was your fault.
Triassic - Cortex Can you send me an invite? - Triassic#3426
Cortex - Triassic Image Host or discord server?
Triassic - Cortex I already got it, thanks.
Cortex - Triassic Np.
Triassic - Cortex there's nothing to really look at in that discord server tbh, nothing special going on there except a meme image host
Cortex - Triassic Yeah, but try searching some racist and offensive words for example:
ky*
Triassic - Cortex that's expected in such communities, this is one of the reasons I hate image hosts.
Cortex - Triassic Yeah, I own a image host dedicated server so I can confirm.

You can say the n word but no hard r tho
Triassic - In my communities, all deregatory words are banned.
Environment - Triassic unfortunately it's hard to enforce rules in a server filled with dumb people (which most image host are)
Cortex - Triassic Almost the same here, you can say the n word but without as a insult, also you can't tell people to kill themselves, and hard r is banned, and on general Hate speech is blocked on my server.
Triassic - Environment Bans exist
Triassic - Cortex That's good, I hope you're actually trying to enforce the rules, unlike floppa.
Environment - Triassic True, but not all people seem to care
Cortex - Triassic Thank you.
Cortex - Environment Yeah, they get banned and they can just get a vpn and a alt that is more then 10 days old and they bypass ban.
Triassic - Environment 
Cortex 

So, they bypass the ban - what's next? If they break the rules again, ban them again, easy.
Deleted User - Hello there, I’m JAMAL, an independent advisor!
Hey people from the drama.gg! I can confirm that this floppa.lol / oceaned.host is running so much illegal stuff. I’m a normal free user of the DanBotHosting and in the last days they DECLARED WAR TO DAN! if you don’t know, dan is a kind and legit free hosting provider he’s hot and awesome! They have been trying to raid the DBH server (they paid some guy that sells tokens to do it ), they botted their boosts and they are violating the discord terms of service in any way. TWITTER, GO CANCEL THEM! #EXPOSED #OCEANEDHOSTEXPOSE #EXTREMEDRAMA
kindly, - JAMAL!
DiscordUser - Jamal Whats your username in dbh
xeny - Jamal bruh
Deleted User - xeny Hello there, I’m JAMAL, an independent advisor!
You are a FLOPPA.LOL staff member, right? #SUS!
kindly, - JAMAL!
DiscordUser - Jamal what is your dbh username
Deleted User - DiscordUser Hello there, I’m JAMAL, an independent advisor!
I sadly can’t check at the moment because discord said "“SOMETHING FUNKY HAPPENED!" And I’m reaching their support for that!
kindly, - JAMAL!
DiscordUser - Jamal  That mean you need to verify your phone number
Deleted User - DiscordUser Hello there, I’m JAMAL, an independent advisor!
I will do that soon, happy to see that there is someone that helps me! #EXTREMEDRAMA #THANKYOU
kindly, - JAMAL!
xeny - Jamal not after floppa took over it, she made it worse
Obamayeeet - How much can you cry lol 

Why would anyone care
auth - Obamayeeet scroll up and you'll see alot of people who care, now stfu no one asked
Obamayeeet - auth cry
Obamayeeet - spongibob proof?
Obamayeeet - Environment if shes over 18 and shes dating someone under age of 18 hows that being a pedo?
Mu1337 - Floppa and their entire staff couldnt even paste astral. Floppas bot is probably skidded too. There is no way someone can make fully functioning bot with embed and shit and cant paste astral
Woosh - Jamal hi armic
Woosh - we didn't bot our boosts i paid for them lol i paid for discord nitro on multiple accounts
auth - Obamayeeet a 19 year old dating a 12 year old, yeah
Obamayeeet - auth dont really see a problem with that
Triassic - Obamayeeet I wanted to just say something to you, but. I'll let the others speak for themselves.
DinoTheDev - pedo dev? i havent seen that in a while
pwned - Obamayeeet hope you are joking.
TheAlex - pwned bro this thread's old as shit my guy
pwned - TheAlex Thanks, It's like I didn't know.
