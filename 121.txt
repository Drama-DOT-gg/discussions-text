Tomas - @Duck do these people still have a Discord server- could you send a link if so?
Duck - Tomas https://discord.gg/X2aY63y
Bear - Didn't expect if someone could do such foolishness :lmfao:
This is lowkey so comedy, tryna make a hosting service with a freenom domain
Korudo - Free domains are not bad except if they are used for malicious purposes
Korudo - Infact my original website was using a .cf domain, my joke host is using one but freenom itself is not a scam.
mtt - Korudo I mean there’s nothing wrong in using free domains for personal projects and blogs or other stuff but if you own a hosting which is supposed to be professional, you’re expected to invest some money and if you have money for making a hosting (aka buying nodes and stuff) you should be able to buy a domain. 

Personally I get domains for anything really cheap on OVH, IONOS or Namecheap

Having a paid domain must be one of the first things to do when starting a host.

Edit: Grammar
Jedrik - mtt +1

and who's taking you seriously as a host when you can't even buy just a .xyz which is like a dollar or smth and had to cheap out Kappa
eheheheheheheheheheh - He had to delete th general chat to hide his mistakes - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-10-12/1602468448-365079-screenshot-2020-10-12-07-36-17-976-comdiscord.jpeg
eheheheheheheheheheh - I wanted to merge my bot testing server with them but now when i think about it i don't want it to be involved in any ilegal actuvity
Deleted User - secuge either merges with via or continues this somehow
Bear - mtt +1 
Domains are like 1$ for your first year LOL
mtt - This hosting really surpassed the level of unprofessionalism. 

If you get exposed on WinterHoax or any forum, you don't just... shut down your 'company'. 
You need to fix it instantly, not any type of (freehostllcltd.tk/privacy.html) with a page like this:

Free Host LLC LTD Limited Company Privacy policy
We get ur email and stuff. we may or may not grab ur ip and dox u
Coming soon (i'm lazy to type a privacy policy or tos for my scam host)

cough, cough. ViaHost cough

You need to accept your mistakes and make the company better, also stop taking it as a personal attack. We're not here to ruin our company out of the blue, we're just here to make hosts a better place and a better customer experience for all.
