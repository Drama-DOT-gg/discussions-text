GreenOfficial - This is a thread about the "new" hetrixnodes
Well  first thing they had horrible downtime and just ruined OxyNodes by changing the server name and advertising it in oxy's discord
Plus after a server nuke they moved to oxy's server
And just less then a week later they SOLD it to Dubs
Then HexitNodes died and now Dubs is saying to move  to MccWorld Hosting

RusJS - GreenOfficial fun fact dubs bought the entire host for 50$ lmao
GreenOfficial - RusJS that is just crazy because the host was terrible already
Chirag - RusJS I think 22 pounds?
Aaron_ - I thought some kid stole the name "Hetrix" and slapped Nodes on it.
SirCat-Qlox - im not even sure hexitnodes lasted a week ðŸ¤£
pwned - Chirag - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-09/1639040359-206845-f145d6c0-fe52-4674-b5f5-13b0a848335e.jpg
GreenOfficial - I just found out that Hexit was actually sold to mccworld and Plexed owns mccworld so really Plexed just kinda scammed Dubs.
