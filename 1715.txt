SnailDOS - Greetings Drama.GG members / the skid that runs locknodes.
Let's start with the plot.
SandNodes was a host owned by Milan, (prior owner being racks aka SpeedOP).
Milan gave me SandNodes owner, however Milan was server owner. I was talking to the community (375 members) and was discussing the future of SandNodes. We where preparing to launch in 2 days. Since that was the date everyone was counting down to before Milan gave me owner.
Just as I was about to buy a VPS I became sceptical and asked Milan for server owner (full ownership). He says I need to ask this rando kid. I end up with a group chat, this kid wont budge, he is clearly is manipulating Milan with threats. I was asking for owner, and he was like "no!!11 lock host new host!1 sand node was a test!". Total joke. He ended up wanting 30 Euro for the server. I was over it, made a new server, pinged everyone to join it and the message was deleted? I look at the group chat and this skid was threatening to leak info from Milan if he didn't delete the server. Obviously, Milan deleted it. Then, if it isn't anymore dumb, I start growing the SandNode v2 server with the old staff team, and well, well well..

(Defamation, We never stole anything, we took the name that the server was deleted, even though I had OWNER.)
This whole thing is a joke, he claims 20GB of ram for free, laugh with me boys and girls!
Eitherway, Don't go near LockNodes unless you want:
abuse owner
harassment
threats
lies
Thanks for reading my thread,
Kind regards,

__SECRET__ - hummm
Milan1000 - SnailDOS i mean u did kinda steal the name for it sooo he iant lying about that tbh
SnailDOS - Milan1000 What? You gave me owner.
Milan1000 - SnailDOS well he still owned 50% of it just cuz he left doesnt mean he lost 50% of it
Milan1000 - so yes u are running under his name/old brand
SnailDOS - Well, he never notified me. In such case we will change names then.
Milan1000 - SnailDOS yes i 100% suggest and tbh yall should just stop this drama, i mean delete and stop saying bad stuff about locknodes and he will most likely 99% do the same and not care about that u ran under his old brand name
Milan1000 - if he doesnt delete it and stop i will tell him to stop and he will most likely listen prob 100%
SnailDOS - Are you joking? We said NOTHING about Locknodes. Tell him to delete everything he said about us, and we will do so as well.
He started it, not us.
__SECRET__ - why tf u guys are acting like 9 years old bozo just change the name to something different
SnailDOS - It's not about the name. smh.
SnailDOS - Aww, he would like me to delete everything I said now. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-02-17/1645111005-609174-image.png
DevXo - SnailDOS First of all, sandnode is trash, now locknodes? More trasher. I've exposed SandNodes before, and locknodes barely has money to buy any shit. Totally trials.
Loser - SnailDOS Invite?
FlyingMane - SnailDOS He also admitted to buying credit cards and getting OVH nodes. I have screens. The host is a total joke, he claims you stole his host, and wants lock nodes to be the continuation of sand nodes. 
Also he dm advertized his host and tried to get people to pay him
FlyingMane - Milan1000 if he owns 50% you and him are at fault.
You for telling snail he had full ownership
The skid because if he only owns 50% he has no right to delete the host
FlyingMane - FlyingMane proof



Also the amount of resources he give south on his host is alr sus enough - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-02-18/1645165715-482283-img-20220218-072650.jpg

Milan1000 - FlyingMane hol on i never said he had FULL ownership, i dont remember saying that
FlyingMane - Milan1000 "Who wants to take over sand nodes" implies you are giving 100% of sand nodes
HaiNot_ - This man stealing money from REAL people and REAL cards. I think he is way worse than badsk who just abuses bugs. Someone told me over 10000$+ is stolen per card from this man and he uses the money for his shit. on the other end gets ovh trials with all those cards he buys from the money he earned on the 1 card.
Milan1000 - HaiNot_ no shit he is stealing money, dude he is already planning to buy some insane nodes wirth the stolen cards which are worth around 800 eur to 2k eur
iiChxrlly_ - Milan1000 what the fuck? stolen cc for nodes thats bullshit he gonna get chased by fbi for frauds
Milan1000 - iiChxrlly_ well it would be fraud either way as it is carding
