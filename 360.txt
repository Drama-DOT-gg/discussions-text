BoscoChungFREEMCHosting - Like a month ago I started RedGate Hosting. I was the original owner of RedGate, but then after couple weeks my staff are unsatisfied of my performance on working on the host, and forced me to change ownership instead of leaving the server. The new owner is Mr. Techy#8251 (ID: 499181504811892748). At that moment he promised not to eat the host (I'm quite dumb I shouldn't trust him
), but the result is after about 2 weeks, he banned all the executive and staff. Today he made a FAKE copy of RedGate Hosting. PLEASE do not join it in case of getting scammed )
