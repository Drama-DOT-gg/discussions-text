BoscoChungFREEMCHosting - Rihard is a scammer. Please beware of him. Here are my thoughts:

So for about a month ago, I joined SkyCastle Hosting. I am a developer of the host. But then we got hoaxed and a guy called Rihard took away all our VPSs. Then I created RedGate Hosting. I thought I should give Rihard a chance, so he came back to help working at RedGate. Today, he did something hilarious. He raided Ectrix Host's bot and the bot went crazy, deleting everything. He even took away his VPSs for the second time for no reason. At last he said he didn't do it and he is very rude and forced me to ban him from RedGate forever.
I was thinking why he even did that? I just want to make a host with my friends including him and make some money. But his wrong desicions made me feel like he is scamming and hacking innocent people randomly.
His Discord tag is @᲼᲼᲼᲼᲼᲼#0707 and his user ID is 665956339033309203 just in case you got scammed by him. *I am not here to commit spamming, bullying him, just some information to help you be aware.

Sappy - Hi! I don't have photographic evidence but I can give a witness report. In Skycastle Hosting, he added raid bots that made a lot of channels with bad words and hate speeches. I have no doubt that he did the new raid at RedGate and Ectrix.
BoscoChungFREEMCHosting - Thanks for confirming.
xAndrew - As a developer on the behalf of Ectrix Host, I can also confirm all of the events. The user Rihard is very dangerous for hosts as he deleted the data from the entire RedGate Hosting VPS. The least he deserves is a Discord ban.
BoscoChungFREEMCHosting - This is a raid report from Ectrix

EmeraldMike - might be late but i can confirm this is all true
Rihard - xAndrew Emerald deleted data, i taked my vps back, im paying for these vpses
BoscoChungFREEMCHosting - Rihard is even a helper in ServerTop Host - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-03-10/1615383046-166717-fdsdfsdf.png
BoscoChungFREEMCHosting - Rihard This post is confirmed how do you still keep on lying
EmeraldMike - Rihard  you paid for a vps that you use to give to hosts and then take it away to go scam the next. No that was you who yeeted all the VPS data.
BoscoChungFREEMCHosting - Thinking of editing the title to Massive Hosting Scammer Watch Out
mtt - Rihard Emerald did not, both of us were in a shared Google Docs writing the statement that you can find here and fixing what YOU did in our host. 
Keep being a clown man
mtt - Also, Rihard. You use the same VPS for any and every host you go on. Then if something happens you force them to backup their data or just delete the whole thing.
This post was fairly confirmed
Rihard - BoscoChungFREEMCHosting Im client
its called paying for service
CODER-nodejs - Rihard you shut up https://mxtt.xyz/Raid-Statement.pdf
BoscoChungFREEMCHosting - CODER-nodejs mentioned before in this post but true
BoscoChungFREEMCHosting - Rihard This is called scamming for Discord ban
CODER-nodejs - BoscoChungFREEMCHosting I was losing my job bcz of him he took meowla beta wich I work on it and raided ectrix and emerald was angry on me
BoscoChungFREEMCHosting - CODER-nodejs I think you should talk with him
TMKC - I am here to say that @Rihard has no affiliation with ServerTop. He does not have any power in the Discord, only the Client role which is given to people who are paying for a service. There is no moderation power at any degree in that role.
EmeraldMike - TMKC  yeah but you are kinda sus still ngl. i mean your host is so small and already shut down after how long???
BoscoChungFREEMCHosting - Btw he didn't delete our panel and client, it's still there but we couldn't login and get access to
Sydney - TMKC I MIGHT be wrong here, but aren't you the guy who exit scammed Eraters? (Also, if you had your own machines, why did you have to use my web hosting?)

I don't have all the details, feel free to respond and such
TMKC - Sydney I did not exit-scam Eraters. I decided to shut down ServerTop because it was not profitable enough to be self-sustained.  I had bills for over 250 bucks a month and I got maybe 40 total from customers.  I started ServerTop because my 2nd job gave me the funds to do it, but I was laid off due to COVID.

We used your webhosting because of pricing, We needed to look for ways to reduce costs.

We wanted to have the website separate from the server boxes so that if a node goes down, the website is still up (best practice).
Sydney - TMKC Thank you for clarifying. Someone said something else, sorry about that
Rihard - BoscoChungFREEMCHosting  its now on SkyCastle mc
BoscoChungFREEMCHosting - Rihard SkyCastle is shut down you dumb

J0SH - trainee*
CODER-nodejs - The bot didn’t got token grabbed at all. Emerald mike accidentally gave him access to admin panel on pterodactyl and i work on emera and ectrix for a bot called Meowla testing ((wich is on beta test) and he accessed my server where I hosted their bot and he grabbed the token and he logged into the discord bot client. I was angry at that time Bcz I was accused of being the raider .Rihard is a scammer and I can prove it.
