this is the most childish thing I've seen a host do



There are at least 2 things wrong with the image below..
One being that they're looking for people who'll just make them a free website... as if that's normal and 2nd being that they made a desktop app but no terms to show for it, There are additional guidelines and regulations to follow when you have a desktop app.. 


This is their privacy policy/tos:


They are 13/14 with no knowledge of security at all nor do they know how to handle client data and follow proper legalities.


"approved by court" my ass lmao...


the owner failed to distinguish a very simple and common phishing  scam and got "hacked" (not but really, the correct term is phished..)

DeletedUser1b71c834 - what the tos is valid
it got approved by indian court
DeletedUser1b71c834 - you were annoying so i tagged @everyone
DeletedUser1b71c834 - we have a tos so its not illegal
Chirag - DeletedUser1b71c834 what the tos is valid

That's not a ToS, that's a shitty AUP
Here's an example for ToS: https://discord.com/terms
Here's an example for AUP: https://www.paypal.com/en/webapps/mpp/ua/acceptableuse-full

DeletedUser1b71c834 - Chirag that wasnt to me

DeletedUser1b71c834 - Chirag i dont even use hetzner
ItzJack - typicalGta They are 13/14 with no knowledge of security at all nor do they know how

Ah firstly i m not 13.
ItzJack - Chirag DeletedUser1b71c834

We didnt even use hetzner u only asked for it and these are invalid lul
ItzJack - @Chirag U asked me to give u hexit method didnt u? U r also 13
ItzJack - @Chirag u use better discord which is against discord tos.....
ItzJack - @typicalGta u always have nsfw status. Which is against discord tos
ItzJack - @Chirag  nice way to festroy anyone hard work - https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/855632801810219038/859866713855229982/Screenshot_20210701_001231.jpg
typicalGta - ItzJack How old are you then? And if you don't want people to think you're 13 then maybe don't act like one?
typicalGta - ItzJack ðŸ˜³ 

okay, maybe I do have the hots of japanease women... but calling them hot isn't NSFW, Go back to grade school. How is that related to this thread in the first place? - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-30/1625080218-695808-image.png
Jamie_ - ItzJack - "i Am MaTuRe"



do me a favor and shut up. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-30/1625080318-56718-image.png
ItzJack - typicalGta u did have nsfw status all time
ItzJack - typicalGta 15
ItzJack - Jamie_ and chirag open a thread
ItzJack - Jamie_ and u dont know hindi so shut up
Chirag - ItzJack no one gives a fuck about hexit tbh
ItzJack - Chirag so why u are posting that ?? U need hexit method lol @badsk
typicalGta - ItzJack Exactly what? Because as the actual creator of those statuses afaik, they're things like
"I like boys"
"sex?"
"Sofia carson is sexy"
"Japanease chicks are hot af"
I also put random song lyrics in my statuses or just links to my websites.... That's not breaking TOS

The thing I don't understand is how the fuck is it even related to this thread!
ItzJack - typicalGta u said breaking tos right? Then nsfw status is also breaking tos of discord. Go and read about it.
typicalGta - ItzJack First of all kid, this is about the host not me as an individual. Second, Don't tellme to read shit bevause I've already done that before you, None of my statuses are NSFW morally, It's not my fault your mommy wants her precious child to not hear about specific words.
ItzJack - Ah 19 year old chapri kid typicalGta Mardarchod ke laude maa baap pe kaise gaya bsdk and ye jo discord ki tos ko shit bola hai na discord ko report krru ga teri gand fatt jayi gi bsdk. Aukat mai rhe. Asshole motherfucker skid
ItzJack - typicalGta fuck off anonying motherfuckers of falix shit
comfyy - ItzJack 

ItzJack Mardarchod ke laude maa baap pe kaise gaya bsdk and ye jo discord ki tos ko shit bola hai na discord ko report krru ga teri gand fatt jayi gi bsdk. Aukat mai rhe. Asshole motherfucker skid

Words of a kid who cant understand and resolve whats wrong.

ItzJack - comfyy ok mama's boy.
BaconHead - ItzJack At least he loves his mother
ItzJack - Listen i dont fucking care about this host or something else i left this host and discord too and codes are invalid and they use contabo. And one more thong host run by 12 year old skid
typicalGta - ItzJack Yeah, It's very obvious they're 12/13 from the way they speak to their actions and how they deal with basic situations. Anyone with a basic level of maturity and knowledge can easily guess that. I wouldn't trust ever using these free hosts tbh. Anyways, Thank you for your input!
ItzJack - typicalGta wlc owner is not even replying to thread only I reply , sorry for bad words bro i was angry but now i found this host  is fucked up already
typicalGta - People seriously wanna trust this?


People are gonna grief no matter what, asking people to spam someone's DMs isn't professional or ethically right and just shows how immature they are as well as how much knowledge they lack. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-05/1625509319-66952-image.png

Anonymous-User-1111111111 - typicalGta Ah when other host do this shit then you will support.
typicalGta - Anonymous-User-1111111111 my man, speak when it makes sense and make sentences which make sense, guessing this is the outcome when kids don't pay attention in primary school.
Anonymous-User-1111111111 - typicalGta I mean that other host also do this. And did you know there was a event in hexit in which we have to insult anyone. And radix host did it because it is nuke and vic become angry. Ik that it is stupid thing but worked on it for 1 month. And nuker deleted all server and client area in 1 secs.

awsamboi - ItzJack why "skid", what if he's not skid, what if he knows more than you ðŸ˜ƒ ?
ItzJack - Hey guys I am sorry for support money hingry owner. He still don't have a valid tos and privacy policy.
Two - DeletedUser1b71c834 when you don't realize you are literally being exposed by an indian, you prob don't even have proof

DeletedUser1b71c834 wtf why and what

DeletedUser1b71c834 first of all, it's the opposite. you don't need a tos, but you need a privacy policy. also, that tos is invalid

ItzJack this thread is about that person, not chriag

ItzJack i sometimes read typical's status, and none of them are ever nsfw. go to school kid. also, again... this thread is about you, not arpan

ItzJack you don't need to repeat what you said

Chirag &lt;-  true, this is about you

ItzJack I'm about to expose your ass right now. I read Discord's terms of service so many times just to prove someone wrong.

don't make a host unless you are 16 kthx
Chirag - Two this is about you

wdym?
ItzJack - Two dont make dashactyl till you are 16 kthx.
ItzJack - Two and i left this shitty host bruh.
ItzJack - Two i sometimes read typical's status, and none of them are ever nsfw. go to school kid. also, again... this thread is about you, not arpan

They were nsfw at that time and i m sorry for support this illegal host....
Two - ItzJack they weren't nsfw though- and ok
