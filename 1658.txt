__SECRET__ - dxqt hello adrea
Zark - dxqt If local authorities take action, Discord must hand out the documents
__SECRET__ - sarveshgamers tf is helex
__SECRET__ - Zark like ur dad!
dxqt - Zark lol you think they will care about a kid in discord
Zark - dxqt If your local authority is good, then probably can. If you're living in India, forget about it. Discord is not a privacy focus chatting platforms, unlike Telegram.
DNSPcommunity - __SECRET__ free host?
__SECRET__ - Zark If local authorities take action, Discord must hand out the documents

__SECRET__ - Zark proof?

falixnodescool - fuck halex bastards
eraters - DNSPcommunity 40mbps. is that even enough to consider a ddos attack?
Tomas - 40mbps at most is a DoS attack, if you are using multiple servers and only hitting at 40, that's bad
Zark - eraters Even 1mbps will consider as an attack
Zark - __SECRET__ He does admit in the screenshot
Ples - Zark "Even 1 mbps will consider as an attack" - ðŸ¤“
Chirag - eraters cough, it wasn't a ddos all it was, was an exploit which he could have easily prevented.
Prajwal - __SECRET__ ðŸ˜‚
Prajwal - Zark uwu kid my son wont go jail tho he didnt try his best to ddos i wish he could
Prajwal - Chirag 

Zark u are a kid next u ill tell 0.1mbps is a ddos
Ibrahim - Zark Discord is not a privacy focus chatting platforms, unlike Telegram.

Errrrrrrrrr telegram dosenr hand out that sorta stuff either kekw
Zark - Prajwal First of all, fix your English first. Second, I bet you don't even know what is DDoS
Zark - Ibrahim Did you even read my message correctly? smt
DNSPcommunity - __SECRET__ i am not going to
Loser - lol
__SECRET__ - Zark can u pls first go and learn english?

second badsk / plxed / plex are dogwaters he is abusing big providers from months i recommend u searching for word badsk then the first thing you will see is a post about badsk just read them
__SECRET__ - Zark wait u talking from that screens 


omfg someone kill me 

u mentally retard son of hoe can't u fucking see that those are from the search option of discord and not from chat 

in short: he is just showing some of the message and trying to show it in a intention of DDoS and not showing the whole conversation
dxqt - badsk should just go commit sc and quit, chirag only threatened all the staffs in halex, and he is telling people to block him, what a retard

we all know what you did so this thread won't do shit ðŸ˜ƒ
FatGrizzly - if a server couldnt even fucking handle a 40 mbps DoS attack, what on jesus fuck is it?

Shershah - dxqt commit sc

Shershah - __SECRET__ toxic kid spotted ðŸ“¸
Zark - __SECRET__ I understand badsk is bad but doesn't mean doing illegal things to him is legal. Could you look at the whole situation rather than being biased?
__SECRET__ - Shershah badsk partner spotted ðŸ“¸
__SECRET__ - Zark could u pls ask him to give the screenshot of the chats then the results for searched up words.
