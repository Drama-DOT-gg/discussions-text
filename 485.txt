Spo3ger - jacooobb not only that he will beg for vps if we dont give him the vps he will threaten us
KylePlays - Ok first of all, Yes i sell VPS from Contabo what is the wrong of Contabo dude

Second, Check the pricing of Vultr, Linode, $5 each for 2 GB of ram &amp; 1 vCores on PolarNodes




Thirdly, Yes i said we are Registrated, But the company ID is still processing

Fourthly, The 17 Locations is true check https://www.vultr.com/features/datacenter-locations/[upl-image-

But still, Sorry if i offended you Jacob i was not on my real state.

KylePlays - Spo3ger Uhh? Did you say you will buy "Kiahost" When there was an auction i was to price on kiahost then i can have 3 VPS if you bought the Hosting Changing the name to "VirtualNodes" - "SkylineNodes"

To me it's fine but sorry if i threaten you
KylePlays -  - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-12/1620816954-130735-image-14.png
Spo3ger - KylePlays I would have given you if you wont have been so greedy
Tomas - braindead ass
Vanquish - KylePlays The fact that Vultr has 17 locations does not mean that you do aswell, smh.
Sydney - When you think major American cities are countries XD
mtt - Just because Vultr has 17 locations, doesn't mean... you have the locations...
KylePlays - Sydney Oh i am sorry, I Should take a look more closely
KylePlays - mtt When the customers want Singapore for example

And it's out of VPS to provide on Singapore we usually say 

"Sorry, The Location that you selected is out of order please try a new Location on your VPS." And wait if there will have new VPS on Singapore we will transfer it for free most of the Singapore VPS have Tax so for us We make it free for the customers.

I am so sorry for the inconvenience of PolarNodes.
KylePlays - Tomas I am so sorry if i am "Braindead ass" i am so sorry i should take a look closely
KylePlays - Spo3ger I am so so so so so sorry Spo3ger
L4db - hmmmm idk what's your point, i dont know if this article making hate or just reviewing it? btw, this picture sent by an honourable gentlemen:



this is not from PolarNodes, it is from  VirtualNodes (Proposed name DynamicNodes) before..

Yeah and idk why you hate them hosting Contabo VPS, but regarding on Payment Options, they accept GCash, and Paypal unlike Contabo you need an Credit Card to actually buy a vps.

and Why hate them host a vps on third parties? 
what do you want? make a VPS Hosting on true Servers hosted on thier own Datacenters? 

It's their business to use third parties to host, and other hosting are doing this, even your favorite hosting, they are running on dedicated servers on thier 3rd party Hosting Company.

I am convinced that a these bunch of kids, are making discussions here, which is not true and just to spread hate and hatred to the owners of the hosts and make them miserable. - https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/839053219480469544/839492581909463070/unknown.png?width=842&amp;height=473
L4db - @Jedrik I propose to close this article here, becuase it is unconfirmed that [PolarNodes] did something wrong.
samxd - L4db An absolute clear violation of the Computer Misuse &amp; Fraud act. You cannot do this.
BlackCat - well overallocating is okay just if the nodes hit 100% usage then its not okay. They maybe have limited slots and its okay
L4db - samxd where? can you prove it?

where any of these?


Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)

The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) was enacted in 1986, as an amendment to the first federal computer fraud law, to address hacking. Over the years, it has been amended several times, most recently in 2008, to cover a broad range of conduct far beyond its original intent. The CFAA prohibits intentionally accessing a computer without authorization or in excess of authorization, but fails to define what “without authorization” means. With harsh penalty schemes and malleable provisions, it has become a tool ripe for abuse and use against nearly every aspect of computer activity.

where?

Computer Misuse Act (UK)

Spo3ger - L4db we doesn't use vps from contabo we use from hetzner
KylePlays - Let's make this clear, We use "DynamicsNodes" Because we pay them to use there VPS

Now, That before Spo3ger became an owner of "KiaHost" I pay Kiano the Original owner 
of KiaHost To use there VPS 

And yes, We have server limits because if it goes the limit of the CPU, We descript it if it's still Available or Out of order 

Thanks for the report,
KylePlays
TheLegit - jacooobb Lmao, they even threatened to DDOS OmniNodes and entered a CC Info  that he states that belongs to Enfernee
KylePlays - Btw our Pterodactyl nodes servers are just test servers, No Clients are on the nodes We are testing it if how many servers it can handle, And mostly the servers are for benchmarking

Thanks for the report,
KylePlays

Tomas - TheLegit They are using the OVHCloud panel then? If it's just a VPS they got from OVH why would they install Virtualizor or SolusVM onto it?
TheLegit - Tomas oh so they are reselling the VPS from OVH?
Tomas - TheLegit idk as in if he's just told you that they use OVHCloud panel then it's a possibility, but can't really tell without one of their ips?
TheLegit - Tomas oh, but Is it really alright to use the OVHCloud panel on reselling the VPS?
Tomas - TheLegit idrk, maybe check the OVHCloud terms and see if reselling is allowed on their VPS range?
TheLegit - Tomas Alright
KylePlays - TheLegit 

Hello, TheLegit

I am trying to say on the ticket that we use OVH Cloud to deploy your VPS, Now all of the VPS are maintain regularly not to leaked Private Information to your server, Now we use OVH Cloud because we don't want like Contabo, We admitted we use them because we are trying to find and buy our own VPS &amp; Database, So that we are not trying to leak something to our members and customers, Good thing we admitted that use OVH Cloud because that's the only thing we can do for today, I'ld like to reply to you guys 

Cheers on the comments,
Founder KylePlays
