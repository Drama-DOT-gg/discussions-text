Jxck_KV - Hey just to let you know, their bots are highly inaccurate from what i've heard. Do you have any evidence that they are using free trials?
AllSafe - Hello Maximus,

Please provide your evidence for abusing free trials and ddosing other hosts.

Best Regards,
AllSafe
Shershah - AllSafe you are no one to go on every thread and ask for evidence by saying "you  have xx hours to prove yourself"
XITENODES - noob our oracle is 3 month old and there are no 3 month old free trails and gcp is temp node we are shifting to contabo and Digi gives only 1 server of freee while we have 4 nodes of digi
XITENODES - and in9 is no-more active that was for testing xCord xD
Shershah - XITENODES show bank statement that u pay
XITENODES - my fathers bank cant
XITENODES - my fathers bank cant
XITENODES - i can show invoice tho
Soul - XITENODES I think oracle is always free for arm machine(26gb and 8 cores) or something like that
You can create multiple accounts at digital ocean.
Idk if you really use any free trials but i am just telling this.
Also i have never seen someone using multiple providers.
Edit: oracle always free doesnt have any limit on cpu cores, and has a 300$ free credit.
Also the below 2core 4gb ram vps ss doesnt prove anything
XITENODES - yes our 16 cores xD
XITENODES - Stop This Thread no more this thing was already shorted our now Stop this and end it
Maximus - XITENODES you can just use multiple accounts in it if not send ss of digital ocean droplets area
XITENODES - happy now
shareing oracles invoice shortly - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-09/1639037558-159105-screenshot-2021-12-09-13-41-33-680-comandroidchrome.jpg
Dilex - XITENODES yes true
Dilex - @Shershah  shershah gandu lodde
Aaron_ - If I'm not wrong oracle has a 300$ limit for free users. 16 cores probably gets you two months.
XITENODES - Aaron_ and we are 3 months old noob this is 4th month ongoinng at its for 1 month google it and seee
Sky - Aaron_ Sounds about right.
XITENODES - https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/FreeTier/freetier.htm - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-09/1639040497-817307-image.png
XITENODES - read noob
Sky - XITENODES Oh my bad, 30 days or less. Almost even a full month lmao... WAIT DOES THIS MEAN SOMEONES ABUSING ORACLE FREE TRIALS?! actually thats the whole entire fucking title LMAOOO
XITENODES - Sky nah we didnt change ur ipv4 nether we had datalosses so this fucking means we didn't changed ur vps'es that means we are not abuing trails noob user brainnnnnnnnnnnn

oh sorry u guys dont hav one
Soul - XITENODES Actually oracle provides always free arm 24gb ram and more than 16 cores. (i google ampere 1 that was listed and it sayed maxiumum of 160 cores).
Also the digital ocean ss doesnt really show anything cause they are 2 core 4gb ram vps which can be ran from a free trial.
Also i checked digital ocean pricing for the 2core 4gb ram vps it was 20dollars per month.  I dont think thats feasible.
Sky - XITENODES Bestie- who says "datalosses" and how did I have ya'lls VPS's.. And how did yall change a NON-EXISTENT ipv4 PLS... when I never purchased from yall. 

The grammar says it all.
Don't say I'm a "noob", because I will clear that shit outcha head. Atleast I'm more mature and have more knowledge than you LMAO. We can clearly tell you are not even 13- so just stop.
Kowone - Sky We can clearly tell you are not even 13- so just stop.

Sky - Kowone Exactly lmao
UtkarshSingh - Soul U ARE JUST A SKID

XITENODES - now happy - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-09/1639044111-296810-image.png
AllSafe - Hello All,

Please provide evidences of abusing free trials, not just looking at the host using cloud provider and call them free trial abuser. 

Best Regards,
AllSafe
Soul - XITENODES yeh cool
Soul - AllSafe They are providing evidence that they do not abuse nodes,not like other "hosts" that you were trying to "protect".
AllSafe - Hello Soul,

Providing evidences is definitely not needed for them, it's their willing. As a thread maker, you are required to provide evidences, not just telling lies and creating chaos.

Best Regards,
AllSafe
Soul - AllSafe Anyone who has little bit of common sense knows that a host using a .ml cant afford 250$ per month for each "vm" from azure. While adding nodes everyday for "free". About evidence i did provide one which you deemed invalid without any evidence.
AllSafe - Hello Soul,

If you cannot provide any evidences, please leave. You are accusing without evidences and just from your "common sense", that doesn't bring him to operating illegally.

Best Regards,
AllSafe
Soul - AllSafe I did provide evidence which you deemed invalid without any thing to back up from. (viethosting thread)
AllSafe - Hello Soul,

If it's in the case, we highly suggest you to file a report with your evidence to the server provider. If the server provider approve your evidence, they will take their actions.

Best Regards,
AllSafe
Soul - AllSafe Ok. Try to not be a dickhead and a hypocrite please.
AllSafe - Hello Soul,

Next time remember to report to their server provider with your evidence and wait for their respond until you create a thread, it doesn't make sense without evidences. Just like calling Netflix abusing Azure because they use Azure.

Best Regards,
AllSafe
Sky - AllSafe Yuh know, I think I've came to a conclusion that this "AllSafe" guy is a bot that has a API to so many sources with a bunch of law suit and legal ones- and barely anything that helps the situation.
FlyingMane - Sky 
Why do you use the "best regards AllSafe" format? Literally what's the point
Sky - FlyingMane wrong ping.
FlyingMane - Sky my bad
FlyingMane - AllSafe read above
Soul - AllSafe Netflix has the actual revenue from sales and started out with an investment. Most free hosts are made by "kids"(as everyone calls them) who dont have actual "investment". Free hosts dont make as much revenue as most free trial providers cost, neither adsense or arc is going to generate enough revenue even if all of their members afk / click ads.  If you have seen no "legit" free host has grown enough as to pay for even hetzner nodes (cheapest reputable dedi provider out there). Exception being falix which used to abuse hetzner and ionos payment systems.
The threads are mainly to tell people to avoid them. I havent created any actual threads but just contributed to them cause i deem these small hosts as "irrelevant". Most of us here on this forum have commonsense that you seem to lack as to you trying to be formal on a forum. "Trying" as to just copy pasting a format while having multiple grammatical mistakes in your "posts". Also being a "hypocrite" as to you asking people to provide evidence while you dont and avoid talking about something you cant reply to(this i fair enough) but calling out shershah for ignoring a line which he couldnt reply to.
AllSafe - Hello Soul,

Netflix is just an example, you get the idea. The idea is you can't just found someone using cloud provider and call them free trial abuser, you need to provide evidences, for example their invoices, chat history and that's the fundamental of evidences. If you doesn't have access to such information, being a whistle-blower is a good idea. 

Best Regards, 
AllSafe
FlyingMane - AllSafe
Hello AllSafe
You saying hello every time just makes you look like a fool, a retard, a skid from the lowest shit hole on earth. 

Best regards, talk normally, drama.gg
Soul - AllSafe As i said before no one can run a "free" host feasibly on these free trial providers so most of the people here deem them as free trial abusers. Showing a invoice with blurred info doesnt take a lot of time. Its just how is it on this fourm. I think you are new on this fourm so i will tell you this, Most hosts here that were deemed as free trial abusers have closed down, and there has been a couple of times where the owner provides valid proof and gets his thread locked and resolved(the resolved mark i think stops the thread from being indexed by search engines and stuff) from a moderator.I think there was a thread on how to report stuff but dont seem to find it. Threads here can be sometimes overexaggerated.
MythicalKitten - AllSafe
Hello AllSafe

https://drama.gg/d/1279-viethosting-viet-hosting-viet-host-abusing-replit-copied-lush-website/109
Soul - MythicalKitten Its not his host. He is trying to "protect" random "hosts". I cant find the exact message where he said this but yea.
AllSafe - Hello Soul,

Again and again, you did not get it. 

Let's make an example here:
You are here to accuse someone who killed your mother and you does not have any evidence he did, you are asking him to provide evidences he did not. Unfortunately he refused to provide any evidence, this does not make him the killer of your mother. You are still required to provide evidences in order to sentences him.

Come back to the case, you are accusing a host abusing free trials provider, but you don't have any evidences. Unfortunately he refused to provide any evidence, this does not make him an abuser, you are still required to provide evidences to support your claim.

We hopes that above example helps you understand the situation and why you should provide evidences.

Best Regards,
AllSafe
MythicalKitten - Soul 
ik im just trying to get @AllSafe  to look at the thread against him since hes ignoring it
AllSafe - Hello MythicalKitten,

Sorry for ignoring you all this time, because we doesn't feel like it's important for us. We would be happy if you keep it on-topic.

Best Regards,
AllSafe
MythicalKitten - AllSafe Ah so you dont care that I copied your entire website, privacy policy, and tos makes sence!
Soul - AllSafe I understand what you are saying but its just not like that on this forum. What i was trying to say is that its much easier for the host "owner" to provider proof that they do not do that and contact a mod to get it locked and resolved. In most of the threads common sense is involved very much.
The threads are mostly to create awareness. As i said before most of these do close down randomly aka exitscam.
RobusOfficial - AllSafe more like u cant find any azure invoice to photoshop and send to the other thread as a "proof"
AllSafe - Hello Soul,

We understand what you wanted to do but you should provide evidences together with your thread, not just accusing without any evidences. You "wanted" the host to provide evidences for you but you know this game is not for everyone and it's their right to reject, you just ruined other SEO just because they didn't provide invoices for you that really sound selfish. We hope this shapes Drama.gg into a more maturate community, not just asking for invoices where in the case you do not have any evidences.

Best Regards,
AllSafe
NotEthan - AllSafe ayo u do this with every host?
RobusOfficial - AllSafe Hello AllSafe
We understand what u wanted to do, but we also need u to provide us proof that it was not another abused shit

Best Regards,
CumbusOfficial
AllSafe - Hello NotEthan, 

We does not help every host, we look through threads and analyse who need helps the most (in the case where the person is rightfulness or deserve to be). If find any thread unreasonable, feel free to tag us.

Best Regards,
AllSafe
NotEthan - AllSafe eh... bruh scammers will be like:
AlLsAfE pRoTeCt MeH
AllSafe - Hello RobusOfficial,

Again, repeating more than 3 times I guess. The accuser should provide evidence, the victim can reject to provide evidence.

Best Regards,
AllSafe
Soul - AllSafe .ml and other free domains are excluded from atleast google crawlers.
NotEthan - AllSafe 
my friend, i think that proof is on the thread ;-;
AllSafe - Hello Soul,

.ml and other free domains are not excluded from Google crawlers, it just their SEO score is lower than paid domains, but it will still being crawled.

Best Regards, 
AllSafe
AllSafe - Hello NotEthan,

Could you state out the evidence?

Best Regards,
AllSafe
Soul - AllSafe Heard that from somebody. Thanks for correcting me.
XITENODES - Soul we aren't use .ml domain skid
Soul - XITENODES The thread was very offtopic during that posts and we were talking about viethosting.ml.
How am i a skid? When you are the one changing credits? (repo:https://github.com/HirziDevs/PteroStats)

Also nice grammar. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-09/1639057660-34136-image.png
SirCat-Qlox - XITENODES cmon pussy boi show that u pay for for it
SirCat-Qlox - but yeah fr xitenodes is a scam lol

Please provide your evidence for xitenodes scamming.

You need to prove your own accusation first before asking evidence from others.

Best Regards,
AllSafe
REALLY_NOT_A_HEKER - YOU GUYS ARE U ALL SO FREE TO TALK ABOUT THIS. LIKE GET SOME JOBS IT WOULD BE MUCH BETTER + why u all have to abuse so much and it's meaningless to talk about it 
you know we are not doing it for just money we are running host so we can learn and get some experience
so we started this project we need money to keep it up and if u ask about what we do of profit we made out of it we invest it in our new projects + support more people who wanna learn and join this community so if u are going to make it toxic and just try to get everyone down or prove them wrong then just think who you are and what have u done Idk how u get even so much time for this if u all are devs or running ur own host try looking after it and as of we ddos other hosts give us a solid proof + about free trials we never sell that server they are for new devs who wanna learn and for our own project most of VPS we sell from which we make our own profit are brought by us and we can't even give u the bank statements for it
I would like to ask you guys to support newcomers than to make them lose hope.
