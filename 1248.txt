AllSafe - Hello Zachery,

Please provide evidence for ReeHost abusing Azure.

Best Regards,
AllSafe
__SECRET__ - Zachery can i be one too? 
I need friends
__SECRET__ - AllSafe ok if u want proof tell the ree host to provide us their invoice of the purchase 
Ez
AllSafe - Hello Secret,

Zachery is required to provide evidence for his claim about abusing Azure. 

Best Regards,
AllSafe
__SECRET__ - AllSafe ohh sure why not give me the discord server invite and tell the owner to set up a inspection i and other will come there and will check stuff and then give us access to the account on which they have purchased their subscription from azure so we can make sure they aren't scamming people and if everything is right we all will leave the server and log out from the account and delete the thread and if they wanna go Easy just tell them to provide invoice so no need to go and check at azure manually this will be convenient for everyone and will make their repo more good as they are providing enough proof and clearing doubts on them
__SECRET__ - And things to note 
We cannot acces their account 
We can argue and make a claim of fraud on them 
We will provide the proof of the stuff we are exposed to not their invoice
AllSafe - Hello Secret,

It seems like you accuse the host without evidence, please create thread only when you have evidence. Moderator please delete this thread as it's invalid. 

Best Regards,
AllSafe
__SECRET__ - AllSafe Oooo

I feel bad about this

I think he heard about abusing hetzner from his 'friend'



and he told me that his friend account isn't even suspended



and more of the screenshot after I asked him what he's gonna do with that azure



Extra image attached:



ðŸ˜” I feel bad for these Images but seems like I said I will see what I can find. i dumped all things that I found in my DM with him with the keyword 'abuse' - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-09/1639011420-515710-discord-qjkmqvaxk3.png

Deleted User - AllSafe enough proof?
AllSafe - Hello dchu096,

When you asked him what to do with the abused Azure, he answered "host my mc server on it". This has totally nothing to do with ReeHost. 

Best Regards,
AllSafe
dchu096 - AllSafe 

Hello allsafe, im sorry about that image. Let me quickly filter out that image.

But I'm sure other images are valid!

Kind Regards

update: post updated
dchu096 - AllSafe 

And about that image about mc server on there please read the bottom line:

"I'm just gonna abuse azure"

Looking forward to your reply!

Kind Regards
AllSafe - Hello dchu096,

The other image is valid, but you should accuse Ree instead of ReeHost, he might have a bad personality but it doesn't mean his host is operating abusing Azure.

Best Regards,
AllSafe
dchu096 - AllSafe 

Hello Allsafe, please have a look at the following attachment:



he have mentioned making azure accounts and start a hosting. So that shows the images I sent above have a relation to reehost - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-09/1639013113-484761-discord-ct3vvfmlgc.png
Deleted User - AllSafe it is lmao
Deleted User - AllSafe your incompetant as fuck
AllSafe - Hello dchu096,

He mentioned that "he can" and doesn't say "he does". Even he does, you don't have enough evidence he is using it on ReeHost, could be other host as well.

Best Regards,
AllSafe
Gamingrock - Lol what is going on
Deleted User - AllSafe yo he fucking confessed so stfu
Deleted User - AllSafe besides put your two braincells to use and think how he can afford azure servers world wide and do all that when he is 15 and has no money and cant even afford a good server for his own smp
Sky - Did they shut down?? Or did they get a new domain..

Their stuff isn't propagating to anything..


Was gonna try to confirm and see if they were abusing Azure VPS's.. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-09/1639014053-193376-image.png
Deleted User - Sky i went on to get them suspended
Sky - Zachery Ah okay, makes sense.
Sky - Zachery Btw, did they ever have WHMCS?
dchu096 - Sky not really. its for billing. he asked me about it so I tell him waste of money as he's not gonna do paid hosting anyways
Sky - dchu096 Ah okay.

Im too broke for WHMCS- just using ControlPanel.GG lmao.
Sky - Sky @dchu096 LIKE- even if I wanted to buy WHMCS rn- im 3 dollars short.
