Daaaamn, he got "angery"


2021 and he still uses the "I'll block u" move lmfao.


I know that my grammar is bad, but still... Can someone tell me what this means?


He leaked his own searched history, gonna put it here so y'all can see what a 14 years old kid search in these days.


Here are some is a photo where he leaked his DMS with his friend, lamaker.


I can bet that he requested some English lessons from him. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-04-10/1618042741-825357-image.png

leastile - second
_MrKnight_ - lmao ty mate for exposing me üôÇ i dont give a shit about it
_MrKnight_ - and i dont think that searching "how to be a weeb" is a crime
_MrKnight_ - and i wont be responding more about this thread because i dont have time to waste in this 
(maybe i will)
_MrKnight_ - and 1 more thing. i thought drama.gg was  made to "expose fraud comapines and peoples" what fraud actives i did here xD
Deleted User - _MrKnight_ I mean, aren't you an MC server owner? I don't think that's quite nice how you talked up there. Didn't you claim to be one of the best devs in India?

I mean, the post should stay in here so everyone would know who are they hiring. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-04-10/1618044970-818827-image.png
BayoDino - mituishere Double posted
Deleted User - BayoDino My wifi is dying
_MrKnight_ - mituishere i "was" a dev. and i do talk nicely but you was so toxic to me so i got raged
Deleted User - _MrKnight_ And? Still, raging or not, that's not how one of the top India mc server staff should talk.
_MrKnight_ - mituishere nah im not rage atm im just viding xD
_MrKnight_ - if you dint had become toxic in that chat i wouldn't had become rage
BayoDino - Never deal with kids
_MrKnight_ - BayoDino fact lol and im not running a company
Deleted User - _MrKnight_ Toxic or not, that's not how to deal with people. I mean, imagine someone hiring you and then being toxic to you and then you starting saying things about virginity and their mums. Not really appropriate.
_MrKnight_ - mituishere i know xD thats why im working alone i dont want anyone to help me so yeah idc
Deleted User - _MrKnight_ Fact, sooner or later u will want to be a staff member somewhere, and then they could find this and just save people from getting cursed by a child
_MrKnight_ - mituishere nah i dont want to xD i like to work alone
Deleted User - _MrKnight_ Then people can see this thread and know where not to play or from where not to buy things.
Deleted User - _MrKnight_ Also u r kinda playing dumb rn.
BayoDino - _MrKnight_ Same I like to work alone but it doesn't mean I curse other people.
_MrKnight_ - mituishere so?
_MrKnight_ - BayoDino he was ultra toxic . he made fun of me in general chat with almost 73k+ users ( yeah he made fun of me in general chat of falix)
_MrKnight_ - mituishere bro kindly understand this. idc about this thread or its consequences
BayoDino - Still doesn't mean you can curse people like this, that's shame.
_MrKnight_ - BayoDino iknow but its not the first time he making fun of me . he did multiple times for being friends with lamaker
Deleted User - _MrKnight_ And? If I was toxic that means that you can curse me like that? You're super childish.
Deleted User - _MrKnight_ Waiting for proof, as I never did that.
_MrKnight_ - i was helping members and out of no where he came and started making fun of me. and he posted everything in other dcs also
_MrKnight_ - mituishere yeah im childish so what ?
_MrKnight_ - mituishere did what?
Deleted User - _MrKnight_ The main reason of this thread...?
_MrKnight_ - he was targetting me and he posted everything in drama.gg discord general chat - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-04-10/1618045884-181617-screenshot-244.png
_MrKnight_ - mituishere you made it tho
Deleted User - _MrKnight_ Still can't see where I made fun of you for being friends with Lamaker.
_MrKnight_ - mituishere i dont have ss of it as it was in old general chat which got nuked while raid happened
_MrKnight_ - and again saying idc about this thread or how this will affect my reputation
Deleted User - _MrKnight_ Then? If there is no proof of me making fun of you because of being friends with Lamaker, then I was right.
Deleted User - _MrKnight_ Then stop talking in here if you don't really care ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
_MrKnight_ - mituishere ok pal i wont be talking here because you asked me to
Deleted User - _MrKnight_ playing dumb again
DHiro - He is dumb af
Toki0179 - mituishere My favourite part is the search history saying "how to be a weeb"
Deleted User - Gonna let this in here

_MrKnight_ - mituishere I said I don't care , I didn't said I won't talk there, bruh
Deleted User - _MrKnight_ You literally sent some foot pics with u at a doctor and started telling your "life story" about the doctor telling you to stop using the pc so much, trying to receive some attention. It doesn't really look like "you don't care", as you said on the Reddit post.
Deleted User - _MrKnight_ You also said that you don't care about me posting a thread in here. Why are you reading this then? LMFAO.

Somewhat - Hi's, I'm LovelyLife/Redknights Ex-Friend

After looking back on what I did, I realized it was really childish, I'm sorry. I did it because as I stated, I felt he was a bad person because he: 

fails to take accountability
brings up stuff that already is disputed (or we've disputed)
gets angry at us, when it's his fault
gets angry at us, if we win / say these reasons at his, and block him, he says it's out fault, bla bla, he just doesn't even wanna lose a debate, but he has already lost.

Now even because of this, it was still a bit childish. However, the video is still up, and been recorded, and logged, people have already watched it, so taking down the video won't do anything.

I understand I may have been childish, and also mostly childish exposing him after we broke friendship, I understand I have also been childish during the dispute about him insulting religion, (mostly at the end, and sometimes) and me after breaking our friendship publicly (he unfriended me, and turned his dms off). (Yeah, there could've been a better way of doing it)

I wish I can change some stuff in the past but I just can't. I'm sorry to anyone I've been a pain to. I will try to improve.

Glowing Wishes

He's crying so badly LMFAO- - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-15/1626333866-167340-image.png
Somewhat - Me and Redknight, have settled the Religion Dispute in DMS. We both could've worded stuff better, and both acted like children.

We've settled it out privately.

Also thnx @Jedrik For alt permission

Though some stuff in this thread is still valid.
Deleted User - Somewhat 
Damn you removed the video LMFAO, you're such a pussy.
As you said in the FalixNodes thread, you've said that you just wanted to add some things in here. Then why did u removed them? LMFAO-
Next time, don't try to protect that kid by calling me toxic because it's not gonna work and also you're not hurting me at all üôÇ))

Also, everyone already knows that Lamaker is his sugar daddy, and that he's also a kissass, just like you are right now to him, so protecting him is not gonna help at all.
Somewhat - mituishere I privated the video because he asked me to? And I don't wanna make enemies. Though, simply that has already happened.
Somewhat - mituishere Next time, don't try to protect that kid by calling me toxic because it's not gonna work and also you're not hurting me at all üôÇ))

I did it because you also used gay as a insult.
Deleted User - Somewhat cry about it :* (everyone uses gay as insult.)
