Vrillex - so now I'm gonna explain what's been happening in this cygennodes server that no one knows of how they operate such large nodes. I was a staff (I'm still in the server as a staff in an alt) and I found a ton of dirt on this host.

To start, their CEO TTEG is a known scammer. I once bought one of his plans and was pernamently banned from the server! Absolute scams!

Another look is him purchasing a new node of 40$, he says he's bankrupt (Asia = bankrupt, he is in Asia and he's going all of Asia is bankrupt) so then you wonder how he is paying for these nodes? He is using stolen credit cards that he buys off eBay to buy this nodes and make a lot of profit from it. He scams a lot.
attached is a screenshot


Another thing about this server is their staff are SUPER unprofessional.

I will continue on this later (sorry for my English as I'm from Ghana) - https://i.imgur.com/BLmpkdX_d.webp?maxwidth=1520&amp;fidelity=grand
Vrillex - Another thing to making note of is Aryans ban, this is what TTEG say about his ban


the real reason Aryan was banned is because he was telling people in secret about what cygen did to their paid customers. - https://i.imgur.com/S4paKVm_d.webp?maxwidth=1520&amp;fidelity=grand
Vrillex - Another India node they was planning, but I caught them using AWS in the node because as staff I got to test it befor everyon else!!![](

Vrillex - Their node is also mainly from Hetzner and look how badly they make their website. https://cygennodes.com/ - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-10-28/1635444673-355245-58f9c4d5-fb7d-4b7d-8ef4-525c16873663.jpg

Vrillex - Vrillex it is very clearly a theme and they remove credits also
Vrillex - N also they sweare a lot in Hindi which is an Indian language ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³
Vrillex - When I first became staff in their host their Owner showed me this and told me if I tell anything about them they will report me to their lawyers and that we owns SHRJS or something. I do a business lookup SHRJS doesn't exist even - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-10-28/1635445153-401412-d5af87e1-88c6-47b5-96e5-b110ef931b03.jpg
Vrillex - Some more drama TTEG username used to be a different and he used to run YagnaHost under the name ADITYA-OP. Yagna was known to scam and run away with money and they're nodes from G cloud, AWS and Oracle cloud all free trials and they use Hetzner bank transfer trick on that one host, TTEG try to clear this history I still remember it. Their domain was used to be Yagnahost.co.vu (co.vu is a free domain rpovidier) and they stole lots of money providing unreal prices (1$ for 100GB ram ) and so on
Vrillex - Last thing he said before he had ban me - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-10-28/1635445589-261386-4ee387c4-2369-486b-b68c-1f8bbdc90787.jpg
Vrillex - Him try to maximize money from this hosting - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-10-28/1635445703-199733-ea3affa3-e61d-4cdc-b5c4-ad43842fc0bf.jpg
Vrillex - no one: his vpses be like - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-10-28/1635446029-324567-024b1235-2a4b-4264-b054-1af4359b9035.png
Oliver1234dotdot - Vrillex That is not true AT ALL, Aryan has scammed me, and that was also one of the reasons he was banned.
VenixDev - @Vrillex 
This thread is real bullðŸ’©...
Oliver1234dotdot - Vrillex That image you found on google my guy ðŸ˜ƒ
Oliver1234dotdot - Vrillex Sorry but, isn't it allowed to promote things in their host so they can ACTUALLY make a profit? They don't even have ads on their sites...
VenixDev - Vrillex
 Is it not allowed to use AWS or what is your point?
Oliver1234dotdot - Sorry to say, but as Venix said, this thread is bullshit, also they're allowed to use AWS trials as long as they don't abuse it, and as I see here, I see no proof of them abusing it.. Also about the stolen creditcards? Do you have any proof of this?
TTEG_Unbox - Vrillex Ohh so now as I am reading more of the messages in this thread it is becoming clearer that you are either aryan's or Skittle's alt.
TTEG_Unbox - Vrillex i never remember sharing this screenshot? And I do not even know SHRJS. Do you have proof of me showing this?
TTEG_Unbox - Vrillex Vrillex be like: A kid posting vps pictures from google and giving false claims about a person
TTEG_Unbox - Vrillex So you say that all the hosts that give a honeygain link are scammers? We do not even have ads on our website even though we could put propeller ads or anything. So there must be some damn way from where we earn and pay for our nodes
TTEG_Unbox - Vrillex You say you are from Ghana but your english does not look like it. Infact it is much better than many. And yeah Asia is expensive do you want to pay 40$ for just a node in asia with only around 4-8GB? 
Our Asia nodes are from Contabo GMBH and we aldready have a 30GB Node from Asia.
TTEG_Unbox - Vrillex Stolen credit cards? are you kidding me?
I pay for each and every node with my hard earned money if you want proof then ask Guldkage Who has seen my paypal and gets every screenshot after we buy a node and pay for it
TTEG_Unbox - Vrillex I never know YAGNA Host. you just cannot create any random host by yourself. I have said this earlier and I will tell now as well. CygenNodes is my first host.
TTEG_Unbox - Vrillex 
Well it is a Wordpress site which is custom made. And you can see our announcements which tell that site is under maintenance.
TTEG_Unbox - Vrillex Wow! Now you are giving fake screenshots as well. We never used any trial VPS. Ask @Oliver1234dotdot or guldkage For proof. They were with me since the beginning of CygenNodes. And also not a single staff has access to our nodes then how come you tested it. If you think I am lying ask our executives Oliver and Guldkage who are the only ones that have access to our system.
aryan88 - Bro whoever you are I pls don,t say about me bec I will get blamed then and I know I got false banned but that is not the real reason if y want to know the real reason my dms are.open and I don,t discourage or want to say anything bad of cygennodes 
Thanks
TTEG_Unbox - aryan88 Thank you aryan.
Ibrahim - fr you made this thread just to go BLA BLA BLA BLA without any proof ðŸ˜‚ðŸ‘Œ
aryan88 - TTEG_Unbox it was actually a miscommunication
done by someone between us which is solved now ðŸ™‚
Ibrahim - also where did you get the staff screenshots from ðŸ‘€
aryan88 - Vrillex it was actually a miscommunication
 btw me and tteg done by someone i can,t reveal he is punished now and everything is good btw me and tteg now
TTEG_Unbox - Ibrahim Lol none of the images he has posted is even there in the staff chat
TTEG_Unbox - This Kid joined 13 hours ago just to post a thread on Cygen. ðŸ¤£ - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-10-29/1635486419-876976-2021-10-29-11-15-30-vrillex-dramagg.png
Aaron_ - TTEG_Unbox Anything wrong with that?
Aaron_ - Oliver1234dotdot Can't find it even after doing a reverse search on google.
Aaron_ - Vrillex The name ADITYA-OP. I remember catching someone abusing google cloud and azure by that name. Coincidence?
Skittle - Aaron_ everything is wrong with that because people can just make new account and blame others with the fake proof they got the first ss he gave was me and tteg talking casually but he is too dumb to understand that and things he wrote is all his imagination ig with some fake proof he got from google
Skittle - Vrillex the ss completely shows that u are a kid that is way too dumb and u made this post just for a reason u got banned and u want to get revenge
TTEG_Unbox - Aaron_ no i am just telling
TTEG_Unbox - Aaron_ For your information we do not use google cloud or azure. Ask our executives
Skittle - Vrillex Did he force u to use it no and many people already know about honeygain way before he just told people that its way u can earn free money and there is nothing wrong in it
Skittle - Vrillex can i ask for some proofs of this yagna host that u made in ur dreams or u should wake up from ur dreams because in reality there is no fking host named yagna and his name isnt even aditya op u just clearly talking some shit right there
Skittle - I am a staff in CygenNodes from its beginning and just to make it clear we do not have any staff from Ghana. i will tell some more things.
all our paid customers have got what they want and we do not have any complaints
if you think we are scammer then look in the reviews channel or our trustpilot page
tteg is a great guy and this is his first host. he never had any other host and cygen is his first host
and next clearly you are blind as you cannot read the announcements telling that the website was in maintenance
the owner never gives access to any staff member to test the services. you just posted a random ip's screenshot
you are just a staff that got kicked for inactiveness
TTEG_Unbox - Aaron_ Must have taken a a picture from his own house then. And none of our nodes are self hosted. there are all hosted by Contabo and hetzner
Skittle - TTEG_Unbox i agree u sent me the payment reciept too everytime u bought a node
Skittle - Vrillex u dont get allowed to use it first as a staff what shit u talking lol
TME - Vrillex Ye people from India don't really use ebay much and it also is dangerous to buy cards so as far as I know tteg wouldn't use them. Also the word "bankrupt" here means that its very costly, it does not mean that he is bankrupt ðŸ˜‚ . Can't seem to understand something easy lol
TME - Also the staff is not very professionaly intentionaly because this is meant to be a friendly community as well as a host and we only need to be professional when it goes to thing related to law.
Skittle - TME yea he is way too dumb
Aaron_ - Skittle They could just be a new user aswell?
Skittle - Aaron_ but it could be other way round
Aaron_ - TME I know a lot of my friends who use stolen credit cards to buy virtual goods which they buy from discord and other platforms.
Aaron_ - Skittle It could, and I could say the same for you. Just talking about all of the possibilities.
Vrillex - Aaron_ Not at all
Vrillex - TTEG_Unbox I've actually been on here for months just reading stuff but today signed up to post this
Skittle - Aaron_ but my dc account is 2 years old so i am good
Skittle - Vrillex anwser the questions
Aaron_ - This whole thread gets invalid due to some dude not providing proof. Oh god ðŸ˜‚
Aaron_ - Skittle Not that long but yea its cool
Aaron_ - Oh and @TTEG_Unbox why don't you provide the invoices to prove that he is lying?
Skittle - Aaron_ dm tteg for it not everything could be public but he can if he want
Aaron_ - Skittle Alright I guess
TTEG_Unbox - Vrillex If you have the damn guts then reply to my answers to your FALSE ACCUSATIONS
TTEG_Unbox - Aaron_ Yep sure
TTEG_Unbox - Invoices come on 3rd November for hetzner and the contabo mails I am not getting so i sent proof from my paypal account. Hope this stops your false claims.

TTEG_Unbox - Aaron_ I do not even know who Adiyta is neither do i know about yagna nodes.
Oliver1234dotdot - TTEG_Unbox CygenNodes is and have always been legit, never did anything illegal. TTEG pays his invoices like he should. So I think we should close off this thread as it has been resolved. CygenNodes does not scam, neither do they use trials.
HarryW - I'm surprised a thread on this host wasn't made months ago. The staff are incredibly unprofessional and half of them are just  hired randomly.
ItsFalcon - Oliver1234dotdot How?
ItsFalcon - aryan88 ur id or just tell me here ðŸ˜€  xd
TTEG_Unbox - HarryW That does not mean you will suppport the false accusations pointed against me in this thread
BreadKitten - Vrillex you are such an asshole u cant make a false thread 
learn from me lmfao
TTEG_Unbox - Oliver1234dotdot Thank you Oliver
BreadKitten - if anyone thinks its scam host just use it and see the Receipt by owner
TTEG_Unbox - Drama.gg Admin/Mod please go through this thread and delete it if you think I have given all proof and also if you want more proof feel free to tell.
Regards
SumUne - TME idk about what is truth but their Staff are sucks for sure
Oliver1234dotdot - SumUne They ain't that professional, but as TTEG also said, he does not want it professional, he want it more like a family. I don't know but I think it's just an asian/indian thing to do. Not sure.
Also sorry if I offended someone there
Ibrahim - Oliver1234dotdot it sorrrrrrt of is yeeah
SirCat - Ibrahim omg 2 months again?!?!
Ibrahim - SirCat LMFAO
CursedAlpha - Vrillex damn kid you are really mad aren't you
CursedAlpha - Vrillex bruh every host does it even kittennodes which is closed now
CursedAlpha - Vrillex welp this is old as f
Somanjitjs - Hey, It's me the developer of the website, I admit it was a theme but now you won't find a single open source code in there, don't believe me? Try google reverse search and stop saying dumb about CygenNodes
kaneki98 - Somanjitjs no wonder it is so poorly made and ugly ðŸ¤£ ðŸ¤£ ðŸ¤£
Ibrahim - Somanjitjs yk his entire thread is bs but you said to try to find any open source on https://cygennodes.com/ andddddd that was the easiest thing ever it's plain obvious your using an open source on that lol and it's again with elementor and it's based on Astra WordPress theme , nothing against cygen but ye it is also a template
BreadKitten - imagine using theme ðŸ’€
Zark - BreadKitten You must use a theme for WordPress, imagine blaming core feature.
__SECRET__ - if this host is another badsk / plexed / plex bullshit host then it's a scam
BreadKitten - Zark it's not wordpress bozo they r using website tempelate
BreadKitten - or maybe it is
BreadKitten - but it still sucks tbh - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-03-02/1646202259-884579-screenshot-2022-03-02-11-53-07-76-40deb401b9ffe8e1df2f1cc5ba480b12.jpg
