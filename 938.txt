Fallen - I was referred to a host named HestiaNodes. Upon further inspection they were using Themed WHMCS that is not licensed. They are selling Netflix, Spotify, Google Cloud, AWS, Vultr. Minecraft. Google Drive, YT Premium accounts which violates TOS of all these platforms. There prices are to low to be true and they do orders over WhatsApp even tho they have WHMCS.
