Jaryn - Thats not even possible
RealOreo - Jaryn Power of better discord üëÄ
Jaryn - i mean i understand you are trying to protect yourself now lmao
Jaryn - RealOreo I mean its bettet to use better discord then nuking and raiding discord servers
Jaryn - So should we report you oreo and get your account termed?
@Oreo
Ender - l
Vanquish - Jaryn discord doesn't log deleted message, good luck with that.
Jaryn - And also you saying in discord i edited your messages, are you fucking retarded there is no possible way to edit message in discord app!!!!!!!!
Vanquish - Jaryn it is possible, CTRL + SHIFT + I
RealOreo - Jaryn but I didn‚Äôt nuke üëÄ
Jaryn - RealOreo you said you did in drama.gg and there are logs that show you did it 
So dont fucking say you got tokken logged
Jaryn - Oreo you are fucking lying and im getting your account termed lmfao
RealOreo - I gave a role to a new admin his application was soo good I just couldn‚Äôt resist giving him admin, little did I know he was a raider. I apologise for I have sinned. I did not let Samco know about this and I have been punished for it, as I was demoted, I did not abed this raid I‚Äôm just a stupid brainless staff just like the rest. Once again I apologise and hope to be forgiven. üòû
RealOreo - I rest my case.
Jaryn - RealOreo Um in my screenshots you say  "i banned like 800 members" and 
"took down hostily nicely "
So dont act like you made mistak lmfao
Oreo - Jaryn u ponged the wrong oreo lmao
Jaryn - Oreo eh sorry
ShadowGhost - RealOreo seems bullshit
Neon - staff discord go brr during this
Vanquish - Jaryn Discord won't ban for screenshots nor do they log deleted (no longer existing) messages.
Jaryn - Vanquish Still there are logs that he raided lmao
RealOreo - Jaryn I don‚Äôt know what your on about to be honest with you. Those messages were clearly edited, and may I ask why they appear red, have you edited Discord API if so it is against Discord ToS. I will need to report this to them ASAP, due to the fact you are promoting a third Discord Client.
Vanquish - Jaryn Please do provide valid screenshots showing Oreo#1515 participate in the raid.
RealOreo - ShadowGhost I‚Äôm sorry to hear about that, I am a innocent Oreo, hopefully soon you will realise. üëç
Jaryn - RealOreo So first of all this is called better discord
it has message logger
When someone deletes messages i can still see it 
And @Vanquish all proof is provided in screenshots that were sended by me and Sam
Oreo - RealOreo 
I like the story change, meow xD. Also, let me eat u meow lul. Cat is hungry

Vanquish - Oreo maybe he was joking? ü§£
RealOreo - Oreo Does are the other raiders, I only made Mint admin, the rest idk how.
Jaryn - So yea everyone report oreo for raiding!
Vanquish - Jaryn u just admitted to using a third party client which discord does not permit to be used, those screenshots are clearly edited.
Vanquish - Jaryn Good luck with that one.
Jaryn - Vanquish How do you not understand, you cant edit messages on discord application, and yes i do use better discord
Jaryn - You can only edit them on google bruh
RealOreo - Jaryn The fact you are able to log messages, just shows that the client is capable of doing other things. Like editing messages. ü§¶
Jedrik - Jaryn How do you not understand, you cant edit messages on discord application

You can kekw
Neon - Jaryn you can do it on the client with a little bit of skill
Jaryn - RealOreo Bruh oreo stfu, why are you lying now lmfao
YOu know you raided that discord and no one tokken logged you lmao
Jedrik - Jaryn Ctrl + Shift + I dumbass
Neon - Neon i posted this before jedrik's message showed up bruh
Vanquish - Neon ctrl+shift+i lmao
Jaryn - Vanquish wtf you actually can bruh
Jedrik - Neon Faster poster better person
Jaryn - Good thing to know
Vanquish - delete this thread smh lmao
Jaryn - And also i just found out that you can edit messages so i didnt edit them.
And there are screens that are showing that oreo gave roles to people lmao
Jaryn - Vanquish why tf would he delete it?
Vanquish - Jaryn you have yet to provide proof that I asked for ü§£
Jaryn - Also lmao i will dm this thread to nightnodes clients lmfao
Jaryn - Vanquish Scrool up to pictures!
Vanquish - Jaryn this is a useless thread, there's no evidence of anything. a sham of arguing, not worth anyones time
Vanquish - Jaryn there's one picture?
Neon - Vanquish i know i dev websites
Vanquish - Jaryn that's dm advertising ü§£
Jaryn - Vanquish there is 5 pictures, im so sorry that you dont know how to count!
Jedrik - Jaryn So first of all this is called better discord
it has message logger
When someone deletes messages i can still see it

This plugin is against Discord's ToS as it abuses their API. Please stop using this immediately, Thanks!
Jaryn - Vanquish im not advertising discord server, i just want them to know that oreo is raided and that they should watch out
Vanquish - Jaryn we've already gone over this lmfao, those messages are edited. that one audit log pic is the only possibly valid one
Vanquish - Jaryn that's still dm advertising
Jaryn - Jedrik Jedrik everyone usses it lmao
Vanquish - Jaryn doesn't matter and no not many people use it infact, it's against Discord TOS
Jaryn - Vanquish They arent, and even that one picture that sam sended is proof!
Jedrik - Jaryn So? Messagelogger is against ToS, not betterdiscord. I'll accept you saying everyone uses betterdiscord, but not messagelogger.
Jaryn - Vanquish And its against discord tos to raid but oreo still did it lmao
Jaryn - Jedrik Message Logger is plugin on beter discord lmao so it is better discord
Vanquish - Jaryn message loggers are not permitted period.
Jaryn - Vanquish And also vanquish i remember you also raided bads discord once
not sure but i think you did
Jedrik - Jaryn Sir, betterdiscord in itself isn't particularly bannable or "Against the ToS", however, paired with plugins such as "MessageLogger" which abuses Discord's API, it becomes bannable and is then considered "Against Discord's ToS"
RealOreo - Jaryn You have hurt my feelings, I will not "STFU" I have the rights to defend myself to this awful accusations about me.
Vanquish - Jaryn you can't really prove.. anything ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Jaryn - Jedrik Yea i know that
Jaryn - Vanquish Omg there is proof, just scroll up
Vanquish - Jaryn I was replying to your statement, "And also vanquish i remember you also raided bads discord once".
Jaryn - RealOreo Oreo dont act like victom here, you raided that discord, there is proof!
If you have anthying to say in your defense say it now!
I know you are lying that you got tokken logged because you sended this message and deleted them right away
Jaryn - Vanquish i said that because you said that i dont follow discord tos
RealOreo - Jaryn Not cool, just stop with these false statements, and get real evidence.
Jaryn - RealOreo You show real evidence that you got tokken logged!
Until then you raided that discord server!
RealOreo - Jaryn I didn‚Äôt get logged, I was joking about that. Like I said above I hired a staff, but had no idea he was a raider.
Jaryn - RealOreo Hahahahaha you dont hire random guy and give him highest perm there is
RealOreo - Jaryn Like I also said above I was being brainless like the rest of the staff, I didn‚Äôt want to stand out.
Oreo - Oreo wat qualifies as valid evidence that can be proven as non-editted? does the user have to like reload discord with the official discord client to prove they didnt inspect element stuff or smthing?
Jaryn - RealOreo Omg im laughing so hard right now lmao
You didnt just give role, you also banned
RealOreo - Oreo Well he will have to disable Better Discord. But if he does that his fake evidence as well as his logger will disappear.
Jaryn - RealOreo Listen oreo, even without my screenshots you gave raider admin perms
So you still raided it lmao
RealOreo - Jaryn Where did I raid it, like I have said for the third time now. I hired a new staff and had no idea he was a raider.
RealOreo - Jaryn If I raided it that means the person who hired me is also a raider with that thought of process.
Jaryn - RealOreo Then people can also fucking say, oh some guy sended me a cool discord  bot and i invited it and it raided my friends discord lmao
RealOreo - Jaryn That is a completely different situation as that is a bot, not a human being.
Jaryn - RealOreo Still you are not that stupid to give someone role that high
why didnt you do it in your discord then lmao
SamCoThePug - RealOreo You really cant say much, you gave Bots role and Bots with admin perms role to 2 users, the users that raided. You wouldnt give someone those roles if you was hiring them would you? - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-18/1621363352-684844-image.png

Jaryn - SamCoThePug Thanks sam finnaly
Now oreo what do you have to say?
RealOreo - Jaryn Sorry did you not read what I said above, I didn‚Äôt want to stand out to the other staff, so I had to become like them (Braindead)
Jaryn - SamCoThePug Sam also Success is his friend and manager on nightnodes(oreos host)
So yea now we 100% know that oreo raided
SamCoThePug - RealOreo The staff are smarter than you acted. They dont just give a random mf * role straight away lmao. These are obviously your friends/alts and your making this shit up or their people you told to raid. Get your facts straight.
RealOreo - Jaryn 

SamCoThePug Who is success and he definitely isn‚Äôt a staff on NightNodes
SamCoThePug - RealOreo They are someone you gave perms to, you must know who they are you braindead fuck
SamCoThePug - I thought you were smarter than this, but my thoughts were wrong
Jaryn - RealOreo Omfg how fake are you bitch, he was your marketing team lmfao
SamCoThePug - Jaryn Wait so oreo was raiding servers to get clients LMFAO? thats even more fucked.
RealOreo - Jaryn When was this?
SamCoThePug - @Jedrik Can this thread just get confirmed already? He is obviously making up BS lies.
Jaryn - SamCoThePug Idk, but i know that success and oreo are friends and success was marketing team on nightnodes
RealOreo - This thread has become a absolute joke, I love how you have no evidence that you are now making up even more false information.
Jaryn - He probably demoted him after he saw this
Vanquish - SamCoThePug there's no valid~ undeniable proof to confirm the thread.
Jaryn - RealOreo You are just little lying bitch kid
Jaryn - Vanquish Are you stupid man?
Sam posted another 2 pictures of oreo giving roles lmao
SamCoThePug - Vanquish I will remove you from the title, its just oreo now.

Like how dumb can he be to give a person a fucking bots role WITH FUCKING ADMIN PERMS. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-18/1621363862-891809-image.png
Ender - L
Jaryn - SamCoThePug And also like i said Success is oreos friend
Jaryn - And Oreo im gonna dm your clients with this thread so they can see proof and so they are aware of how bad you are
Is that ok
SamCoThePug - Jaryn He isnt friends with oreo on discord, but he is friends with the person who raided our discord before, nyan
Vanquish - Jaryn I didn't said there wasn't proof to deem oreo a raider I'm saying there's no proof that indicates all persons included in the thread title are guilty of "raiding" the discord server and confirm the entirety of the thread.
Jaryn - SamCoThePug He unfriended him and he took his role right before this lmao
last week succes had "marketing team" role on nightnodes discord
Vanquish - Jaryn I can speak for him in this case, no that is not okay.
SamCoThePug - Vanquish It dosent let me edit the title, Ill ask jedrik to remove you from the title, and maybe confirm the thread
Jaryn - Vanquish Thing about you i am not sure if its true
but about oreo is 100% true
Tomas - Actually, Oreo wasn't the one who raided if you claim his friend did the work - therefore what you've said is untrue. And you can't provide solid evidence &amp; use a tacky plugin on a client which breaks Discord's ToS.
SamCoThePug - Tomas Okay, we can still say he started a raid/took part in a raid, which is still against the TOS. Also im not using betterdiscord im just using audit logs, which isnt against the TOS.
Tomas - SamCoThePug Talking more to Jaryn on the BetterDiscord part. As in, once again, his friend initiated the raid - he merely ranked the user, this could've been unknowingly of what the user would do?
SamCoThePug - Tomas I mean its kinda pretty obvious to not give a random user fucking admin perms, he could of just guven them support 1 which has like no perms? Dont just give someone * straight away, he wouldnt do that on nightnodes would he.
Tomas - SamCoThePug Probably not, Sam. But his friend also played a big part in this so he should also be included more in this thread because he actually raided, right?
SamCoThePug - Tomas I guess
leastile - Jaryn ctrl + shift + i
Vanquish - lol
PugRug - Ok, i'll explain my opinion ig.

Please do not judge me, im not on anyones side.

You can edit messages in the Discord client.
Oreo had never raided,  his friend/alt raided it.
And its pretty sad how it got raided again
Please do not judge me on here, I think it's his alt, I'm not really sure, anyway i think its really stupid for you to create a hoax for this. Just don't give random people admin??
Dubs - They really had an argument about.. how to edit messages :/
PugRug - Dubs Dubs, are you seriously working for Hoticly, or what ever its called..
SamCoThePug - Nah puggo i demoted him
theMackabu - @Jaryn @PugRug @Oreo @SamCoThePug (reply to audit log ss above)

even the audit log can be changed, screenshots are not safe anymore
example:
 
only screenshares after page reload are safe for now... - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-19/1621401477-892745-image.png
Sydney - BetterDiscord is against Discord TOS, but they will not ban unless you are using malicious plugins.
You can edit messages, or any text at all, in the Discord application
Why would you give people admin when they are just starting?
Don't raid kids!

I am providing my unwanted opinion. I shall await the unfunny "me looking for who asked" images below
Dubs - PugRug ew no
BaconHead - theMackabu dude nothing is safe what if someone edits a video and then makes that video show in screenshare?
leastile - BaconHead then go on anydesk
PugRug - Dubs good
