Deleted User - I'd say so. I've never used them myself but I've never seen someone have a bad experience with them.
exelen - Ricardo Yep, I think it's good. Except upload speed (sometimes)
YajTPG - If you're using it for a public host then not at all, it's pretty good for personal use. Keep in mind, if your IP is hit by a DDoS Attack (and if they can't migrate it), they will completely shut down your server until the DDoS attack is done
NighMayHigh - Contabo itself is decent for a individual needing a basic vps or something.

it only gets its bad name from hosting companies reselling Contabo vps servers, they are not designed for this, and should not be used as such
Willypro7 - Contabo is decent but the antiddos sucks
INfoUpgraders - YajTPG migrate ddos??????????????
Parallax - YajTPG If you take the correct steps this can be avoided.
Knifeworm - Ricardo I would say yes i use them for my dedicated servers.
CursedHoliday - Hetzner is good but low rating. Contabo is good too but higher rating even their anti-ddos not that good. I'm still using them till this day.
