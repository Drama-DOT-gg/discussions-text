And they started host again by using with not only azure free trial but now they are abusing Amazon Free trials too.




Much updates are given below, kindly go through full thread once

I would request drama.gg to not close this thread till all the points, I mentioned is solved.

Thank you. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-07-15/1657870575-799710-screenshot-2022-07-15-07-20-55-30-5a415ff834f6bc153619606941c55eb5.jpg
Parzial - Github will keep providing 100$ free credit on azure, they will keep abusing it.
Aplimmm - GOOGLYGo first of all whats wrong with not giving their bills? its a private information so its normal. then we got bad ddos protection so what if you think its bad just dont buy their product simple, and about no tos and pp? well fk it its just some random small buisness thats not even registered, im sure legal info is not needed if their buissness not even registered
Aplimmm - GOOGLYGo and also, if that guy is breaking discord tos why wont you just report it to discord and be helpfull instead of making a thread abput it? poating it here wont help it
DramaPro - GOOGLYGo yeah this types of hosting, keeps doing this stupid things I'm sure host will die in 4 months as free trial expires hahaha.
DramaPro - Aplimmm if you have problem just report it yourself 👌, everyone has their own opinion and he is just saying the truth about host.
Rose69 - GOOGLYGo yeah I just joined there website is Fully fûkd by ddos and server are using literally 100% and the lag my god , they are giving unlimited cpu &amp; ram to every Booster, I'm sure that's the stupid idea ever to give unlimited ram &amp; cpu as you know your 16gb azure vps can't handle a shît
ilymygf - Isn't the owner the same guy who made phnode using free trial and shut it down after like a month?
Aplimmm - DramaPro report it my self eh? sure, and lets just talk about how you say "everybody has their own opinion and its true" its true? yes it is true but im not saying abput his thread are false or something, im just telling what i know about it to "solve" it so please just fking shut up if you dont know anything thank you
ilymygf - Aplimmm this is the reason I love drama.gg lol , reading msg make me laugh as f
Aplimmm - ilymygf tbh thats also 1 of the reason i love dgg :p
GOOGLYGo - Aplimmm hey apilmm 

I'm just clarifying all points, I understand what you trying to say but having a detailed information is always a good idea.

I already reported his old account which is banned from discord and he created the account again,so it's not a new thing I will do what I have to do, glad you reminded to report again.

As he said it's his company I just ask for company details and bills, they refused so it just to make people know the truth I included the points.

I'm here to just tell the valid truth. If you think I hurted your felling.I'm sorry for that.

Thank you
LucaDev - Pretty mature announcements I'd say.

Aplimmm - GOOGLYGo sooo? they arent a registered company so im sure they dont have and dont need company info and billing is a private information, its not like you chould just ask google for billing of their stuff, and also stop trying to be "proffesional" itw wont help you even spell my name wrong
Aplimmm - LucaDev whats wrong with them being unproffesional its just some random small buisness they chould do whatever they want, its not a registered big company or something
Aplimmm - LucaDev what? as i said its just some random small buissness that not even registered so there is nothing wrong
GOOGLYGo - Aplimmm I'm really sorry for that but you didn't read it properly they say it's a company and there can't be a company without a registrasion and talking about billing I included that information as other people would like to know about it as my friend brought a server they didn't provide any information which I'm trying to say it's too unprofessional for host as the staff and owner himself act like 14 yr old kids.

Again I'm deeply sorry to pronounce your name wrong,I'm so bad at pronouncing names
GOOGLYGo - Aplimmm well running a business without a registrasion is illegal, according to real owner country guidelines

You can have more information at https://kmc.solutions/business-registration-in-the-philippines/#:~:text=The%20law%20states%20that%20using,Industry%20(DTI)%20is%20illegal.

If he is not a business/ company and working individual then he have to remove it from website and include his tax id and I'm sure running a business isn't allowed in his country as he is underaged to run both public/private businesses

I hope you are able to understand.
GOOGLYGo - LucaDev they banned me because I asked for there azure invoice where he tells he pay monthly $100+ to azure I'm not wrong but I'm sure he is scamming it
ItzTechroDev212 - GOOGLYGo Actually We Have An Tos

XxMBGxX - XxMBGxX they nuked without any proofs of us abusing.
LynnMetsuiker - GOOGLYGo thanks for sharing this with us.  i never heard of it but since my friend had alot of proof and sended it too me i was like flabberghasted when he showed me his screens. idk the owners name but if he reads this is not cool to call people n and go in private dms to be racist asf.
Reii - they banned me for no reason at all.
XxMBGxX - Reii same
Loser - ewn is gay
Tomas - Loser ..and?
GOOGLYGo - Enough guys.

Yesterday the host was raided by their own staff!.
• Banned 400+ customer's.
• Deleted All Server's including their paid clients.
• Leaked All the Databases.
• Leaked client mails,ips and other private information.
• Full Data breach

They don't care if there clients information is leaked or server is deleted by their own staff.

This kids need to be stopped. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-07-15/1657869362-456238-screenshot-2022-07-15-12-43-48-44-5a415ff834f6bc153619606941c55eb5.jpg

GOOGLYGo - I have updated the thread information, If missed some points let me know
XxMBGxX - GOOGLYGo can i get ur dsc id? i wana dm you about something which you can add innit
niya - GOOGLYGo what do you expect from free host, all are stupid as f and these people are like behaving under 13yr old kid, the stupidity and racist level is 📈
XxMBGxX - niya I agree, but there are a few hosts that a professional
GOOGLYGo - XxMBGxX to protect my privacy, sadly I wouldn't be doing that but you can send me a mail at googlygo@chitthi.in
Aplimmm - GOOGLYGo whats wrong with starting a new host anyway
GOOGLYGo - Aplimmm it's same bruh. They just shut down for few hours as there host got fully fûçkéd by there own staff/hacker and that's it , they started again but not just using azure free trial but also Amazon free trial.

Kindly read again what i said, stop defending the host(aka kids) which aren't registered, have no tos, abuze free trial, can't protect data, unprofessional etc.
Aplimmm - GOOGLYGo so? i dont see why you cant use free trial, its not like using free trial is illegal
Aplimmm - also its a free host dont expect anything, its freehost no data is safe from most freehost they dosent even have enough money to do stuff, if you want great service use paid host. yes freehost is bullshit but still everybody should know the risk of using smthing free
XxMBGxX - Aplimmm well I agree to you for a certain point but you also need to go through the fact that they are racist and being rude isn't the best way you wana make up your host with is it ?
Aplimmm - XxMBGxX well i chould agree thats wrong
GOOGLYGo - Aplimmm the point isn't not about free trials, the point is about abusing it and telling people they pay $100/ per hour like tf, ddos protection, unprofessional,racist, illegal, not tos and much which I can't even explain in 1 msg

I highly agree ,paid host are way better but this thread is to tell people the reality about the host as people aren't smart like we are🤝.
GOOGLYGo - XxMBGxX what do you expect from 10-14 yr old kids lol
Aplimmm - GOOGLYGo abuse? more like using free trial, you got no proof of them "abusing" just some picture saying you got banned for asking what  provider they use, and whats wrong about saying they paid 100$/hour yes it is stupid but dosent mean they abuse
GOOGLYGo - it neither means they aren't abusing, as far as I can they are using azure from more than 3 month's and that can't be possible without "abusing" azure free trial + won't be also using Amazon either.

I dont have problem with if they aren't abusing or not , as I said before I am here just to mention all the points which are valid it's the user choice to believe it or not, if they are legit they would have provided the detailed information long back ago.

repeating I don't have any problem if they are abusing or not ( of course they are) , it's one of a point in the thread against the host + they don't care as the owner himself said it "they don't have any proof"
DramaPro - Looks like he just want to create a drama here because he is sitting free and have nothing to do other than arguing in one word "abusing" again and again 😂,ig so.

GOOGLYGo - ewn that's not the question, and that doesn't proves anything, don't act like 13 year old stupid kid, oh wait you are 13 yr old, my Badd.

Wow you brought a new vps by abusing trial again' , why weren't you satisfied after I reported you on Amazon for abusing it maybe you need more than suspend account ig.

I thought you would learn something after your account got suspended but still u will be a stupid kid.

Aaa we are moving from the topic, let's just show us the receipt of your invoices from azure with your invoice I'd and comapny I'd that you have brought it.

And aren't not using trials again' from new account

Thank you.

MommyOni - Aplimmm If you're gonna comment on something, atleast know what happened. Base your opinion on facts so that you won't look stupid in front of us all
EyedChalice2148 - Aplimmm I don't know they provide free hosting because they told me to have a budget or premium plan so it means we need to pay because I have more than 200 players so I needed some hosting that supports gcash payment method not until I discovered this drama.gg and he won't refund my money back you should know the whole story before judging he scammed so many clients!

EyedChalice2148 - GOOGLYGo I suggest that go to bisect hosting apart from cheap they provide excellent services and also they are global and professionals
GOOGLYGo - EyedChalice2148 well ty for your opinion, but I just use my fav host from 2 year's, and I won't say the name as this could lead to a issue.
ewn - EyedChalice2148 well, go back to the discord server ill give you back your server
GOOGLYGo - ewn 
SO, you aren't going to stop abusing and to clear your fault you wanna give him a new server he has already lost all his Server data , creating a new wouldn't make anything better and what's the possibility that he won't be able to lose his data back again every 2 week's you guys create new non-sense problems,if you really want to apologise just give all paid customer there money back and don't take 3rd party person to handle billing who will run away with the damnn money.
GOOGLYGo - Ohh yeah forget you are 13 can't use paypal or stripe, gcash hahaha use your parents I'd kid, at least they won't run away.
