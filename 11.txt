Jedrik - Andrex [ andrex#6969 ]

Is known to have used Nulled WHMCS on his host “webud.xyz” now “astrako.xyz” or "primehost.xyz"

Link: https://summerhoax.com/d/42-webudxyz (Down Now)

He now bought reseller whmcs so people can’t tell him about his Nulled WHMCS using.

I’ve dug up some old dms and found that I had this gold when I asked for his proof of buying bemusic:


The picture in question:


So, you’re asking, why am I bringing up an envato invoice?

Well, you see here, he said “he helped his mom with something” when he clearly took minutes editing a picture from the Envato market help center.

As you can clearly see, the item id, the yellow boxes, and everything else is the same. Not to mention, the badly edited “(vebto)” text

Not to mention:



He has not changed. He used Nulled BeDrive and BeMusic. He bought reseller whmcs so he can’t be told he nulls, when exactly this month, he did.

He also, in multiple times admitted he had Nulled WHMCS and offered ne0n for them to use it, and literally asking for arc money.

He’s still young, I hope he learns from this. Unlike some other people, he’s still young and developing. Unlike the other people in this site who are almost grown ass adults and act like a child online.

I’ll be updating this thread, if I find anything else.

just c+p cldn tos here done
Jedrik - deleted The point is yes, it's generic, but yours is just word for word on point
deleted - just use a tos gen and you'll find out that the tos is generic /shrug
deleted - i also like how many hosts have almost same-looking TOS
deleted - anyways was updated :P
Deleted User - Lmao he tried to contact me so hard, and after I told him that I can't trust him, he told me to think about Tommy and then he removed me from friends. What a kid :))) - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-08-11/1597135267-348579-image.png
deleted - mituishere i love how you do not like the truth :))))))
deleted - mituishere 
meh , before complaining about me look in the mirror
Deleted User - deleted and what should I see in the mirror? I mean, why should I trust a scammer like you? I like how you complain about other host services problems, but you can't even make one by yourself without using any leaked software. Everyone can find here reasons to not trust you.
Deleted User - deleted Huh, I do not like the truth? You are a scammer, and everything you can do is just to say to look at any other guys that did something bad in their life. Even if Tommy did something bad, you are still a scammer and nothing will change that.
Deleted User - Just get a fucking life as you are the only one member active on this almost dead website.
Matteo - Allow me to introduce my self.. xD
Jedrik - mituishere I feel attacked
Matteo - lmao
Deleted User - Jedrik Sorry for you feeling attacked, my last message isn't supposed to be for you. And still, at the latest you got a life. The only thing he can do is to cry on here about every host that haves more popularity than himself as a person.
Deleted User - Oh, and also @deleted , you are not so different like Calin from FastVDS.




So, as everyone from Romania like to say, before complaining about anyone go and look in the mirror. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-08-11/1597136305-22115-image.png

mxnugget - lol it's just a new forum about exposing hosts, not that big of a deal
Jedrik - mxnugget nah he shouldn't have one,

He's an absolute scum

It's going to be more biased than what they have been crying about

and it's going to be 10x more autistic because anything andrei reads online is true no matter any evidence backing it up

He also lies, and manipulates kkbai
