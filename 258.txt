FatGrizzly - So me, @Tomas and some other people were looking into this shitty host.
And here yo go.

These dudes were using Nulled WHMCS and once we found out, they completely locked out using CloudFlare.

And They were using Nulled cPanel too.
Server IP=5.9.24.229(I was a bit late in posting this here, they now moved to plesk, it has a 14 day trial, waiting for that to expire).

(SarveshMrao was a senior staff at that time).

Asking(Begging) people on how to crack cPanel, later being tired he bought Nulled cPanel.

And for giveaways they dont spend their money at all, They use the good old HostGator x Whmcs method to giveaway .host domains. üòê

btw he doesn't know how to spell emergency. 

and also they change their server hostname everyday(and forgets to update it in whmcs), to prevent attacks

Owner and Co Owners play in general chat:

Their server doesnt even have 150+ members, but only partners with 200+ members servers:

https://i-am.ddosing-your.site/ef4xE3MV (This was done by SarveshMRao)

and I just asked for my Ticket Transcript and now they complain that my dms were off and their bot crashed, as it contained some exposed info about their Host the Co Owner just deleted that channel.

And for their uptime: 
from their statuspage(noobs forgot to update it):
https://i-am.ddosing-your.site/dEB7l0rP
and for real uptime, you can check the monitoring channel in their server, and btw their servers go down everyday

The number of times they abused WHMCS.HOST:

https://i-am.ddosing-your.site/qy6bwaT1
https://i-am.ddosing-your.site/ucb1lJoG
https://i-am.ddosing-your.site/2NLCMmOW

And more domains for himself, and I will leave some links down here,
and yes, I must wait for 14 days until I contact Plesk cuz they might be using a trial license.

XInterverse - Basically, this is their summary:

Nulled
Rude staff
illegal company
Can't even manage hosting properly
The CEO [NAME REDACTED FOR PRIVACY] acts like he knows everything but he's just a 13 year old idiot who wants to roleplay as a leader
The Co-Owner says he has retired but still manages the company (basically IQ: 0)
If they think you know the secret about them using nulled scripts they delete all evidence and ban you
They steal and delete your data (See here and here)
They respond to complains like these with "Thanks for letting us know, we will try to improve" on Disboard but on the Discord server they're completely different and rude because they control Discord but can't do much on Disboard - aka they're retarded asf.
RusJS - XInterverse discord
XInterverse - RusJS https://discord.com/invite/nke7hh3
Tomas - XInterverse (he may mean the link)
FatGrizzly - @RusJS https://discord.com/invite/nke7hh3
XInterverse - Tomas lol just realised (sent him on DM)
XInterverse - Stay away from TreeTopHost, many people are beginning to realize what kind of company this is.
Don't lose your data and waste time arguing with an illegal company with rude scammers.
maddant - I can confirm they are really shitty people &amp; a bad host overall.
Bxrk - they had a go at me for posting the winterhoax link lmao
Bxrk - also deleted the winterhoax link yes i have a message logger for exposing reasons - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-03-09/1615299548-75869-image.png
Bxrk - deleted the message and banned me - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-03-09/1615300201-87021-image.png
XInterverse - Apparently writing a complaint to a partner is called DM Advertising and it's rule breaking?
Woah the Co-Owner has much more IQ than me!



Thanks to Naman Vrati for teaching me that complaining is called DM Advertising! - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-03-09/1615300870-717360-image.png

Sydney - Joined, and about 6 hours later, someone DMed me asking how I got the link. And if I knew this thread existed. 

Either a staff member failing to check out whoever joins, or someone from this thread
FatGrizzly - Sydney umm, can you reveal the guy who dmmed you?, I guess it must be Kamei or allroundernaman
Abooz - Trash host
FatGrizzly - and btw, they try hard for nulled cPanel lmao(from the email screenshot).
https://i-am.ddosing-your.site/X0dpMtYA

try hard for free reseller host too,
https://i-am.ddosing-your.site/v8UE0vro
Tomas - FatGrizzly have also looked into the free reseller thing and all it does is sell your info

fun times for him
FatGrizzly - well and btw, as this is confirmed can mods/admins add dat confirmed tag? or I must provide more proofs?
XInterverse - LOL they just banned me and my friend because we exposed them. The Co-Owner Naman was speechless and he didn't even give a reason for a ban cuz their rules didn't say anything about telling the truth.
Guess he wants people to believe this nulled scam.
Sydney - FatGrizzly An account named webdev (Default pfp, not a new account)
Bxrk - SHEESHSHSHSHHSHHHHHHHHHH - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-03-10/1615399147-68009-image.png
Tomas - Naman basically banned everyone who joined from here
EdwardSnowde - whats their website imma try it to see how good the tps is with my base 300 plugin tester
Tomas - EdwardSnowde it's webhosting
Jedrik - Tomas bet their webhosting can't even handle WorldEdit smh
Two - (I'm probably not going to join the server, if you are one of the toxic owners looking to see if I joined to ban me. np saved you time.)

I read the Discord Terms of Services multiple times, and that is not considered DM advertising. You can report people for DM advertising, and they will disable DM advertisers' accounts. If they don't ban the user for your definition of "DM advertising", it's not considered DM advertising. At most, they'll say just block them.

If you really believe that's DM advertising, try reporting them yourself: https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000029731 (use message links, not images, they won't accept images)

They won't disable "Naman"'s account (in this case), because it is not considered DM advertising.

just for people who own that host to read this
Tomas - Two naman owns the host-ish
XInterverse - EdwardSnowde https://treetophost.com
Sydney - XInterverse Downtime in action - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-03-11/1615455904-519213-image.png
