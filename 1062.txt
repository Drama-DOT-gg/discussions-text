Nothing, until you dive a little deeper.
My opinions aside, its a fresh start for new bots who are trying to get a following however, it seems to be a complete copy of the old top.gg design. 
Aside from the minor issues with design and layout, there doesn't seem to be any legal documentation. Considering that they are collecting data and using data, they don't seem to be telling you how they store it and how safe your data really is. 

Above- A footer on the website where the legal documentation should be linked to be seen on every page but isn't

After some digging, I found what "appears" to be their privacy policy and terms of conditions. But nope, its just a blank page.  Not to mention how difficult it actually was to find the legal information.

Putting the legal issues aside, how reliable is their site, really? Their Discord server has a total of 200-300 members that are either inactive or active, which wouldn't be an issue if they weren't faking the voting statistics of their own bot. The bot is unverified but has 10k+ votes? Their site doesn't have good or any SEO and it has 10k+ votes. Something is just not adding up here.

Chirag - at least, ask them about it lmao? - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-10-01/1633121979-110132-image.png
Jamie_ - I am getting annoyed now at seeing so many people make a post before asking the person first. If you have a problem with a host/company, talk to them. They may have a perfectly good explanation like they did above. And it doesn't look to me like they have properly released so that's why there isn't a TOS or PP. Please just ask companies/hosts before making posts as it saves everyone so much time!
dxomgmyfriend - Jamie_ True you should ask for the TOS and PP first.
