Deleted User - Invite link to their discord is https://discord.gg/rQyvZ9SP
They banned me for getting their owner who accused me of nuking their server to confess plus heres what one of their designers said 
"I am taking a break from eclipse because of the following

I believe that most of the staff are underage due to thier behavior

The server has broke the tos some times

I am not getting paid

I am doing this so if the client get exposed or something, my reputation will go down insanely fast

I hope you understand"

Deleted User - You admitted it which is not concerned here its about them being unproffesional and them not having a tos or pp
EclipseClient - Zachery But Still I Did what You Said To Do
EclipseClient - Zachery So Whats the Thread About Me Token Grabbing?
IoNetty - Hey eclipse, you want a new vps right? - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-09-12/1631433041-899463-image.png
EclipseClient - IoNetty no thanks
Stealth_Ar - guys lets just iggnore this mf and move on, we are busy people
IoNetty - Stealth_Ar I have all of eclipse's confidential files and source code too.
IoNetty - It was poorly obfuscated or leaked by apis in the software
Deleted User - Stealth_Ar no
Deleted User - Its not that simple wtf you broke the tos so you get drama.gg'ed
Deleted User - Do note your 13 and you have been using discord for 3 yrs so you started off when your 10 so you too have broken the tos
Stealth_Ar - Zachery you are just a kid who doesnt know what he is talking about
Deleted User - You sure? Backup your statement with evidence
Deleted User - Im pretty sure your the kid here.
Stealth_Ar - Zachery you are trying so hard to be dank lol
Deleted User - Number one no i am not
Number 2 dank meanss for "Unpleasantly damp and cold." How th doea this make sense
Stealth_Ar - Zachery idk lol
Deleted User - So since you have no good arguments your going to show your childishness by saying random nonsense? How tf am i the kid when your so immature
Stealth_Ar - Zachery adult people also like being childish that doesnt make them a child
Deleted User - Stealth_Ar indeed that is  true to be frank i am quite childish myself but atleast i am more mature then a "child"
StLVox - IoNetty that's false, eclipse hasn't even been released
Deleted User - StLVox we have the source code on beta
Deleted User - Unreleased edition thats why you are so bad at securing your own data
Deleted User - https://epic-memer.cyou/OXVwuyAfVK
Lmao
StLVox - Imagine - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-09-12/1631444806-725891-screenshot-1101.png
Deleted User - Yes i did attempt.to grab his ip but in no way is it "malicious" how it is used determines wether its a "malicious" link or not yet if you claim that its malicious your basically saying every single website in the planet is malicious
AEugene - Zachery out of everything youve shown here I realize that youve been using VPN the entire time huh ðŸ˜„
EclipseClient - AEugene Yea I Noticed That He Is not Even Using any Router
EclipseClient - Zachery Imagine Making Excuses Which Doesn't Even Make Sense
Deleted User - EclipseClient not excuses and just since you dont understand my valid points does not make them "invalid"
Deleted User - AEugene its because im outside
Deleted User - EclipseClient just since im not using a router does not mean im using a vpn and how is my using a vpn your problem?
Deleted User - AEugene and no i was using samsungs data privacy feature thats all.
tan_playz - I know this message isn't related but don't buy services from people who own a free host and decide to make a paid hosting with a cracked whmcs license. You're going to legit loose your progress of your servers overnight
Deleted User - tan_playz who are you refering to exactly?
tan_playz - Zachery like hye or lamakar and people like that, we've already seen how they've  left primesrv and hye hosting.

Just spreading precautions
Deleted User - tan_playz yeah i thought you thought im hye lmao
tan_playz - Zachery nah lol I thought you were hye but I did not type that cuz your pfp looks like hye's but just typed that randomly as I had that thought
Deleted User - tan_playz oh ok

Deleted User - Well you gotta flex that you have a mac somehow
Deleted User - Anyways if anyone has more info on the client such as more proof of how bad and unproffesional the management is and if you manage to get a confession that any member of the management is underage post it below btw note: i offered hwlp to the client by helping them organise staff and get unproffesional staff and even tried to help them get a tos or pp but the owner said "suck my tits" and banned me so... guess the client wont change and note: the lead dev is 11
