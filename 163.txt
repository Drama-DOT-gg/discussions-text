TMKC - WockySlush Congrats, you have ONE free package that is almost completely useless.  200MB RAM runs what, a simple JS script?

And the thread you posted is actually proven to be incorrect, which can be verified by the staff of WinterHoax. I don't actually know why that thread is still there.  The thread is no longer valid.
JAY - https://bootstrapmade.com/bootslander-free-bootstrap-landing-page-template/ anyone want there theme

not like they edited hardly
JAY - WockySlush still not rlly a free host and explain the nulled whmcs its been days and your still up for selling
WockySlush - oh and for the "nulled whmcs" we actually purchased a license key from you and you decided to delete my key (which I paid for) and banned me and blocked me from your terrible hosting provider. 100% of our reviews are 5/5 stars so I'm not sure where your getting scummy from. As you can see, a few days ago we did infact have "authorization" to use WHMCS.




here's the plan we had from your awful hosting provider


you also resell from these people

JAY - WockySlush you broken our tos and the resault of that is service termination

https://www.whmcs.com/members/verifydomain.php
says  "This domain is not authorized to be using WHMCS." for a reason

and you also started being abusive to staff and and threatend staff
TMKC - WockySlush The license was suspended because you where breaking the ToS.  We also had to take down any WHMCS licenses because we found out that the place we got the licenses from actually where not autorized to sell them. As soon as we where made aware of that, we had to take it down from the store.
We used our own WHMCS license system for our WHMCS install, but after this we had to go to the official site and get a key.

If we didn't revoke your key, it still would have ended up with the same result, you not being verified.
WockySlush - JAY you don't even have a valid tos you are not a business.
WockySlush - Okay, well than you sold me a unauthorized WHMCS key??

TMKC
JAY - TMKC if they dont have a key they cant keep site up its gotta be taken down asap
TMKC - WockySlush We where not aware of that. It was after the whole ordeal that I contacted WHMCS and asked them about it. I received an email back telling me that they where unauthorized to provide us with keys to sell and then we immediately took it down from the store.
JAY - WockySlush doesnt show why your whmcs has been up for some time and hasnt been taken down
TMKC - WockySlush You dont need to be a registred business to oerate a ToS.  Maybe use Google for 2 seconds before typing out things like this.
Tilted - I don't think there Frauds just for listing "free hosting in their plans." if you think that is a fraud that you're out of your mind honestly. Navo hosting's coo is begging for money from streamers and is buying nodes from it. Please keep in mind that he says he has cancer and was asking the streamers for money because he needed help paying for bills.

If I had bought any of there products I would 100% rate them 10/10
WockySlush - TMKC Instead of creating a thread on my hosting provider which you have never used before (none of you) you should have contacted me like a professional and explained what had taken place. Besides the WHMCS issue, all of your other points are invalid.
JAY - WockySlush changing the subject shows that you dont want this to happen oof.
TMKC - Tilted Bro, get out of here. You think you are much better, yet you sell Xeons advertising them as I9's and are in dept on PayPal because everyone did PayPal claims to get their money back because of the fraud you ran.
Get real.
WockySlush - TMKC "Bro get out of here." how professional of you.
JAY - WockySlush you might wanna see the top of the thread you done 10000% worse
WockySlush - You have now opened a thread for one "semi-valid" point that you caused, please re-evaluate your case.
JAY - WockySlush we did and there is the evidence may you send us your tos and policy on site
WockySlush - JAY It's true though, people like you do disgust me.
WockySlush - JAY Though, I wonder why our reviews are flawless?
JAY - WockySlush you aint responding cmon send your terms your site says different
TMKC - WockySlush Right now, I honesty don't care any longer.  You and others are bashing to hell on the business I help operate, when you are not any better.  You start talking smack about things on a clean thread because there is no posts proving anything.  If you are gonna bash on someone like me, you better be prepared to provide accurate evidence and it the correct context with the FULL story.

What goes around, comes around.
Tilted - TMKC 

Lmfao honestly only if you had bought the i9 from me and not josh i'm sure it was prob your fault that you got the xeon.
JAY - WockySlush stop changing the subject and being a cocky 12 year old
JAY - Tilted take thats somewhere else this is irrelevant to tha
WockySlush - JAY Let's be honest here, your the only 12 year old here.
JAY - WockySlush cmon send terms and remove the nulled site
Tilted - JAY your the 13 year old one 😂🤣
Does your parents know your here?
WockySlush - TMKC pretty sure we do have a decent amount of evidence you can refer to Tilted's post above for a preview.

"Navo hosting's coo is begging for money from streamers and is buying nodes from it. Please keep in mind that he says he has cancer and was asking the streamers for money because he needed help paying for bills."

Mhm
JAY - Tilted sure i have a national insurance number and ID
WockySlush - JAY Do you know what Nulled means? Doesn't seem like it.
Tilted - WockySlush 

I'm pretty sure that's fraud 🧐
WockySlush - TMKC your point?
JAY - WockySlush yes your running whmcs without an official license which means you don't have legal rights to using there online software
Tilted - alright, anyways I'm done with this drama. 
Imma be grown and just leave before things get worst.
WockySlush - Tilted Agreed.
JAY - WockySlush you cant go you need to removed your pirecy site and show everyone your tos and tha

and mabey an ssl {fixed now lol seems sus}
MCKingSam - You should not be using nulled software full stop. 
I recommend you force SSL on your main site. Gives an awful first impression if SSL is not forced.
You should have a PUBLIC Terms of Service and Privacy Policy before offering services.
Are you sure this isn't a data farm? No Privacy Policy yet collecting a lot of details via WHMCS.
You are not authorized to sell FiveM Hosting. Do not. I shall be reporting your servers shortly.
Your domain shall be reported to WHMCS.
Why aren't you using a subdomain for the billing portal?
JAY - MCKingSam agreed
ExoticalCat - MCKingSam I agree
WockySlush - MCKingSam I do believe that SSL is forced, I've had no issues with it. We're working on purchasing a new WHMCS license but we're a little short for money at the moment. Navo Hosting decided to delete our license. We are a new hosting provider, we've just recently established our website that is the explanation for a missing TOS/Privacy Policy. Firewalk is not a data farm. We will sort the issues you listed as soon as possible. Thank you for organizing them.
TMKC - WockySlush Then dont start a hosting business without money.
JAY - WockySlush dont explain the site STILL BEING UP!!
JAY - WockySlush and you should be marked as currently not in buisness because you cant sell through discord thats breaking their tos so i suggest closing for a bit
MCKingSam - Thank you for your reply. It appears that whoever you purchased your WHMCS license from is not an authorized reseller. Authorized resellers do not sell business licenses for just $4.00/mo. Secondly, I highly recommend you shutdown your billing site until you are authorized to be able to run WHMCS and have a TOS and Privacy Policy in place. Otherwise, your domain could be blacklisted by WHMCS themselves.
WockySlush - JAY We have now temporarily disabled the site.
WockySlush - MCKingSam I appreciate that, we will be purchasing a license directly from WHMCS as soon as possible. We have temporarily disabled the billing site until a new license is acquired.
MCKingSam - Could you please inform me of the site selling these WHMCS licenses so cheaply? I will happily report them to WHMCS.
JAY - WockySlush you shouldn't be having your business running rn you should announce its temporarily closed due to discords tos you can't sell products with their platform manually and you don't privacy / tos
WockySlush - MCKingSam We purchased a license key from a hosting provider by the name of Navo Hosting, Jay is the owner of this provider. Navo has since removed the WHMCS Licences from their site. I believe they resold from a company called "License Hosts".
TMKC - MCKingSam We where selling them the key originally. However, we used a provider where we got a License Reseller account. They asured us that their keys where legit so we went with it.
After a while, they sent us a message about that they where unable to sell keys because WHMCS has patch the "holes", which I found odd if they actually where auyhorized to sell the keys.
I then contacted WHMCS about it and they said that LicenseHosts.com was not authorized to sell licenses and we immedietly took down the WHMCS licenses from our store.
MCKingSam - WockySlush Alright, thank you for the information.
JAY - WockySlush yes but we reported them and sent out emails to clients to appoligies and a sorry gift we had no idea regarding this
WockySlush - JAY We're working as hard as we can to restore the website with proper WHMCS authorization we are not making sales via discord as you assumed at this time.
MCKingSam - TMKC Did you have to replace any specific files to install the license keys, such as the license.php file itself?
WockySlush - MCKingSam Yes, they did that file specifically.
MCKingSam - WockySlush Thank you for the information.
JAY - MCKingSam look up I replied back
TMKC - MCKingSam Yes. There where a "module" that automated the guidelines on how to install the licenses. We where assured by LicenseHost that it was legit so we went with it.
JAY - MCKingSam we decided to remove that from our store and we reported the provider for the licences to whmcs we had no idea till recently 

due to the provider saying " we no longer sell whmcs verified licenses due to whmcs fixing the bug "

then we removed it and realised we needed to resolve this and remove it and send out an email
MCKingSam - Alright. Thank you for the information, everyone.

Please take these factors into consideration before purchasing a WHMCS license from a reseller:

If you have to replace the license.php file, they are using a specific method to authorize your installation which has not been approved by WHMCS. They are not authorized resellers.

Are the licenses sold individually? This indicates that they are not an authorized reseller. License keys are not permitted to be sold separately https://www.whmcs.com/resellers/ If they do not ask you to replace the license.php file, they could be abusing the Hostgator free WHMCS registration. 

A personal recommendation for cheap WHMCS licenses is https://skynethosting.net/. They offer a free starter license if you purchase some reseller hosting (https://skynethosting.net/whmcs.htm)
JAY - @WockySlush i came to set things right with you by trying to make a civilised relationship but you been cocky / childish and said no its gone to far were meant to act like adaults
JAY - MCKingSam okay we kind of fell into a trap and the https://licensehosts.com company seemed legit
Deleted User - Dont these guys use the logo from https://firecloud.tech ?? or is it just me
JAY - Znilla wow
MCKingSam - I see. It's fine, we all make mistakes. Just ensure you take the factors above into consideration before purchasing a WHMCS key from a reseller.
WockySlush - MCKingSam Thank you for the suggestion, we'll look into Skynet.
MCKingSam - Znilla 


Do you own that site? I hope FiveM isn't coming soon, otherwise I'll have to report their servers. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-01-24/1611450071-334921-image.png

WockySlush - Znilla I've asked for you to calm down with the flaming, to actually fix the issues dming me would be the best option. I'm not able to keep up with the posts. I can't do everything at once so you'll have to bare with me.
WockySlush - I understand the severity of the situation at hand. There are a lot of issues that I'm working as fast as I can to resolve.

WockySlush - Hello, those of you viewing this thread.

Firewalk Hosting's billing site is now disabled until we get an authorized WHMCS re-seller or directly purchase a license from WHMCS themselves.

We have removed most if not all traces of the Firecloud Logo from our discord and website. If you find the logo on our site please let me know.

We will not be making sales through our discord server if you were wondering.
FiveM Hosting will be removed from our store once it's up again.

All bans will be revoked within 24 hours, some have already been revoked.
If you have any questions please directly message me on discord for the fastest response.

Sincerely,
Vanquish#5889

WockySlush - Hello, those of you viewing this thread.

Firewalk Hosting has now purchased a new, legitimate WHMCS license key.
(To verify that it is valid, use the domain "firewalk.host" if not, try "billing.firewalk.host")





All traces of the Firecloud Hosting logo have been removed from Firewalk.
We're working to restore our website to a proper state for production use. If you find any issues please let us know.
SSL should be working fine, let us know if not please!
