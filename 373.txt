ShinyPlasm - Everybody by now knows the falixnodes databreach right? 
Emails, ip address, passwords and possibly more were leaked. However, https://heliohost.org is abusing that and is sending people spam email about "HOW YOUR KOMPUTER HAB VIRUS"

This is incredibilly childish. In the screenshot, you can see that someone of the emails belong to falix staff, which shows you that the emails are from the db breach. 

Here's the ip the email was sent from: 65.19.143.6

And here's the email header.

Robert - ShinyPlasm HelioHost is not doing that, that is someone using their web hosting to send email via their Tommy server.
