Mocab - They claim to provide up to 800 GB of free storage,
I have tried uploading a folder with the size of 500 MB, it was very fast, but when i checked i found out that most files were not there
It has an upload limit of 4 GB
you can connect other cloud services to it, like google drive and dropbox
