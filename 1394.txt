PeacefullPerson - So yes we should make a peaceful hosting community so all controversy can be over like so many host are in controversy idk the names but there will be any ofc so we can make a community and only one host will be the head of the community the head will be chosen by public votes that can be held on our discord server ( its not ready yet ) we will make a agreement whoever wanna join just join this dc server and yes! 

peace out ðŸ˜€
CharityLexus - Your idea makes sense and has a decent concept but this just seems kinda like a nonchalant advertisement (i don't even know what i'm trying to say, but that's close enough)

also, there are many flaws with your idea. Just because you're gonna make a peaceful drama free host does not mean there aren't gonna be more hosts that pop up that cause drama. You're acting like this will stop all drama, but it won't (or maybe i'm just not understanding what you're saying)

Indeed I agree one or maybe more host will pop out and make some drama but most of the drama 50-60% can be over due to this community and re-read the post again there were some spelling mistake because I was in hurry yesterday but now its fixed and I am not promoting or something just wanna create a peaceful community like a government. The government makes people need fulfil and they see that there will be no conflicts like this we are gonna be a peaceful com:munity. I think you didn't understand I am not talking about making my host I am talking about to make a community.
__SECRET__ - PeacefullPerson well mate if you mean by a tag or certificate that your host is approved by drama. gg and is good 

so...........
just suppose if everyone agreed 
then most of the host owners will come and ask for approval and drama.gg is a community for exposing not providing any kind of license and this will just end up like some big popular host with that approval and some host with a shit reputation [tho this is the same condition as now ] and not to mention there are some host which like kubbur

my bad, must have misunderstood that part

 but most of the drama 50-60% can be over due to this community

honestly i doubt that, i'd probably say 35% or less, just because there will never be a shortage of 11 year olds abusing gcp free trials. Plus, there will always be drama in general. You do have an interesting idea tho, and if this idea does become a reality i'd be very intrigued
GreenArrow99 - someone should make a forum site or a listing site and list all the legit free hosts
Aaron_ - GreenArrow99 who would have the time to deal with kids? I can already imagine them dm'ing the moderators of the forum site and telling them to add their host on the forum list because they use hetzner and not GCP.
PeacefullPerson - CharityLexus @GreenArrow99  Aaron_ 
Yes just the idea will be successful so it will be nice and indeed skid owners of 11years are gonna abuse gcp etc trials but we will admit only those who are giving proofs for paying for their vps and node.

GreenArrow99 i am talking for create a legit free hosts community.

i need some sort of public support also to successfully approve this idea ðŸ˜„
