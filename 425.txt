The proofs are here:
https://nexthosting.net/index.php/knowledgebase/1/Terms-Of-Service.html
If you click "Privacy Policy" or "Usage Policy" redirects to WinterNode. 
For any reason the URL used to ToS, is a bit similar to WinterNodes, not?

And DONT HAVES PRIVACY POLICY!
I attemped search it but nothing.

Is all from my part. I dont know if the service is bad, i only know their partners is a bit toxic, no more.

Sorry if i maked aomething wrong
