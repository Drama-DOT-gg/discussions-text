provsalt - Does anyone know what happened to vivalnodes.net? Seems like the owner MXGLatoya / SavageResponder (old username) has allegedly ran away with clients money and shutdown their services without any notice.
FatGrizzly - provsalt can you provide some kind of proof? instead of just text
provsalt - FatGrizzly just lookup vivalnodes on google and you could find their trustpilot which people are complaining, videos talking about the situation, he also disappeared from discord completely and removed everyone as his friend. His website has also gone completely offline
Toki0179 - provsalt Provide screenshots so we don't have to go searching for them ourselves
Deleted User - Toki0179 Just go google VivalNodes, there will be atleast 3 videos saying they scammed people and all that stuff, but heres a link to one of the videoes. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41bODapQEu0
Toki0179 - Znilla thanks
Toki0179 - Damn you are right, I went on the reviews and they are filled with people saying things like "Help my server has stopped working" and just talking bout the exit scam
provsalt - The owner used to work as a manager in another host (witherhosting) and has stole about $1k usd for his host and fled when he got caught. I'm not sure if they are telling the truth but it's quite convincing if you ask me
RealKnight14 - I Can Confirm This Is All True I Was A Partner At VivalNodes And SrAdmin On Riverrain123 server which got deleted because of this dm me RealKnight14#0122 for Proof and answers about this
