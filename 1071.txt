DinoTheDev - :o tea! üçµ
z_t0ht - DinoTheDev oh hey Dino don‚Äôt mind the comment
Milo - z_t0ht LMAO Fuck off z_tOht. Dan needs to get his head out of his fucking Ass and Fix his hosting. This is all on Dan. I don't remember Ever asking for your opinion üòÉ
MyUsernameeeeeeeeeeeeeee - Milo u make my brain hurt 
What exactly has DBH done and how did you get photos of ticket channels
DinoTheDev - MyUsernameeeeeeeeeeeeeee to find this guys username we need to track the staff that has been demoted in the last month
DinoTheDev - z_t0ht ello
DinoTheDev - but honestly idc most stuff said is true
DevNoah - Ah yes, DanBot Hosting, a land of overflowing tickets, hideous Node downtime, and a Halloween themed status page


I've been a Staff Member on DanBot Hosting before, and what can I say, I enjoyed my time there. 
I enjoyed everything, but the actual staff part.

You see, at DanBot Hosting, about 99% of the things that are wrong, are only things that Dan can fix.
This includes but not limited to the following: 

[This is the most important] Granting users who donated or boosted their spots on the Donator Node
Refunding Users who do not wish to use their Premium Server anymore.
And a bunch more but I'm too tired to keep making a list

At DanBot, the Staff are more on top of things than Dan himself. I've had to deal with someone that had been waiting for a donator server for over 3 months. At that point I was just done because I had school coming up, so I just went inactive completely in the server. Although Dan is a great guy, and I like his personality, he can make some awful decisions and doesn't seem to really care about reputation.

Dan has helped me get my own hosting service Vertix Hosting get a jump start, and I thank him for that, but that doesn't justify the other things, such as nodes being down, donators not being able to access the donator node in its entirety, etc.

I truly hope DanBot Hosting gets the refresh it truly needs, and thrives on to be the best free host out there, but until then, all clients must wait. I still will recommend DanBot to Developers looking for a free host and don't wanna go out of their way to pay for one like every normal person to ever exist. But cheap devs can be cheap devs I guess. 

And to Dan, you can make the changes that will make this host better, the real question is, when will you do it... - https://devnoah.reeee.ee/5c0dC_a5D.png
Milo - MyUsernameeeeeeeeeeeeeee 

What exactly has DBH done

Everything is there
Microwave - just gonna say this: im from america and i 100% confirm that people dont sue other people for looking at them the wrong way... stop saying that this is how america is because ITS NOT - ok have fun with the rest of this thread üôÇ
Milo - DevNoah Ayo, Don't forget Dan Has DDoSed your Panel before on Stream üòÉ
DinoTheDev - Milo he got permission im pretty sure
Milo - DinoTheDev Nope. He never did.
Milo - Hmm, You aren't on to anything... I really don't know who the fuck that is. - https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/846214284958105600/895476959268720720/unknown.png?width=538&amp;height=426

Microwave - Milo gg. lol
Bocon - Milo This is unacceptable I was there for the stream and Noah personally asked Dan to ddos his panel
Bocon - Bocon Was planning on cussing you out but that's not happening yet...
Milo - Bocon I don't remember asking if you were or not. I doubt a person would do that then rage when it got DDoSed? anyway I wouldn't be Surprised if you are on here soon. üòâ
Bocon - Milo He never raged at it and why would I be put on drama.gg?
Milo - Bocon He Did rage. I legit heard Dan talking about him gonna DDoS him in VC before he Deafened everyone. Him and Freddie went into a New VC and continued to DDoS Noah. Anyway lets stop talking about Noah. This Thread is all About loving Dan &lt;3
Bocon - Milo You didn't answer my question. Oh wait you can't
Milo - Your hosting you have been talking in DBH chat about ofc &lt;3
Bocon - Milo That was ages ago how would that affect things today?
Bocon - Bocon wait how do you know I haven't said that in dbh yet
Bocon - Milo So now ur just not gonna reply?
Milo - Bocon I got my contacts.
Bocon - Milo took you 14 minutes to put contact lenses in?

Now stop avoiding my questions and answer me
Milo - Bocon I was Making sure the person was Fine with me saying that.
Bocon - Milo person? so you're talking for someone now?
Milo - Bocon Yep.
Bocon - Milo So whoever wanted to make this post is scared

Anyways time to stop getting off the topic now answer my question
Milo - Bocon Nope. I wanted to make this post. I just got some info from them!
Bocon - Bocon Still waiting for a response to this
Milo - Bocon I got the info some way. I'm now gonna go. Since I got a life!
Bocon - Milo Mhm leaving so you can avoid my question
DinoTheDev - Milo hm he knows how to run a host btw dm me i wanna talk with you I won't release anything, not even your username and that's my promise
Milo - DinoTheDev Hello Dino! I would rather Not DM you! I don't need my Username leaked at all (or Known)

Milo - Xcyth I mean I just wanted all the info I could find. I'm still Digging up stuff on Dan So I will update this post soon!
Giyu - just saying, even if he get permission to ddos, he cant do that until the person who want to get ddos need to own the machines , datacenter and the network and if he ddos it will affect the other clients who are in the same datacenter so he will need to pay some $$$ if he cause damage to the infrastructure
DinoTheDev - Giyu hi
Giyu - Bocon he/she
 have a life yk
Giyu - DinoTheDev hello?
Giyu - also personal opinion: DBH SUCKS , SUCKS THAN MY OWN LIFE !. never seen a host with worst downtime dont dan host the dedis in his kitchen? and with heck yeah toxic community just like BFH with most of the people are kids 13 or more lol
Giyu - z_t0ht oh i think ur father forgot to teach you manners, oh wait! i forgot ur mother got railed by some random drug dealers in the streets, im so sorry for ur existence, he should have used a condom üòî
UnknownUser384 - Most active users want to involve sexual activates with Dan and the Mods/Dan allows it even tho there under the age of 18
Giyu - jesus-
Chirag - UnknownUser384 evidence?
UnknownUser384 - Chirag - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-10-07/1633590349-114040-image.png

Chirag - UnknownUser384 that's a joke you retard
FC5570 - Chirag LMAO-
UnknownUser384 - Chirag still wrong
Chirag - UnknownUser384 no, that's a fucking joke. I don't think your small head can understand it tho
Giyu - Chirag you know what will happen if it was lamaker
UnknownUser384 - Chirag its still wrong no matter what plus the mods barely moderate the chat someone was getting harrassed in the chat and the mods did nothing about it I watched the whole thing
Chirag - Milo Nodes Being Down 90% of the time and Never being Fixed

did you mean wings?

Milo Screen Shot Solo Sent (there were more that got deleted by Dan)

it's pretty clear that solo has deleted messages there

Milo Unbanning Users that Abused the Node than Giving them Admin

Milo Tickets Being opened for 5+ Months and Dan never responding

Milo Wanting To Sue a Hosting Because Their ToS and PP Kind of Looks the same

dan never even mentioned about the tos and privacy policy blindass, first take your head outta your ass, and then talk.

Milo Guys Look DBH is Halloween Themed!

Milo They Also don't got rules. Does this mean I can Raid the server?

discord.com/guidelines
Chirag - UnknownUser384 evidence?
UnknownUser384 - Chirag 
he's a moderator and did nothing to Xcyth when it was clearly in the rules that bulling wasn't allowed - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-10-07/1633591617-662570-image.png
Milo - Chirag did you mean wings?

No, I mean Them really Being Offline

Chirag it's pretty clear that solo has deleted messages there

Even If he Did (They Could have been in VC and Dan wasn't talking) Dan still was DDoSing

Chirag who cares? definitely not me.

Why The Fuck would you even Care? You legit Mined on DBH and Only got unbanned because "Dan Talked To You"

Chirag it's a free host idfk why y'all expect good support from free hosts lol

Ah Yes. Let me Pay for something than Never get it! He has Paid options for things. You shouldn't need to wait Ages to get Access.

Chirag dan never even mentioned about the tos and privacy policy blindass, first take your head outta your ass, and then talk.

Legit Take a look at Dono Lounge he talked about it. Go Ahead and Ask anyone in the Listed.host staff team. oh wait Nonono Ask MasterMined!
Milo - UnknownUser384 Did you forget to put your Brain in your head?
DinoTheDev - UnknownUser384 i fucking swear if it was on that one time we're I broke down I will fucking find you
UnknownUser384 - DinoTheDev it was but it was still against the rules
DinoTheDev - UnknownUser384 can't argue with that üòí
Xcyth - @Chirag are you just defending dbh now that you have been unbanned and made an egg for them?


P.S: I'm not on anyone's side I am just enjoying the drama - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-10-07/1633592000-16085-image.png
Giyu - Xcyth god wtf
DinoTheDev - UnknownUser384 special message from darkerink
"Since I'm going to bed, Tell the person (Coming From Me Take a SS if Needed) Jam was Joking, Xcyth Wasn't Bullying. If that person is such a retard that he can't understand a joke they should get off the internet
and If the person had such a big problem with Xcyth ""Bullying"" They need to make a ticket"
DinoTheDev - Xcyth LMAO
Giyu - just saying, cant this thread get the scamming tag? because as the convo says the donators didnt got their return items for the donation for over a month, so its kinda a scam yk
DinoTheDev - also @UnknownUser384 idc if xcyth did that I really don't care stop trying to defend me I can defend myself I'm not 3 years old I'm 16
DinoTheDev - Giyu @Sloth decide
Xcyth - yeah @UnknownUser384 if dino had a problem with me he can say it to me in my dms or he can make a ticket to formally report me so mind yo damn business
DinoTheDev - Xcyth also its the damn internet i don't give a fuck
Xcyth - DinoTheDev exactly
Giyu - DinoTheDev i mean whats ur oppinion? dont they deserve it?
DinoTheDev - anyways yall contiune i needa charge my laptop peace mf's
Xcyth - yeh imma get back to class, continue. Just for the record I do not have an opinion on this.
DinoTheDev - Giyu yes and no but lets let sloth decide when he wakes up
Chirag - Xcyth that's before I met dan.
Xcyth - Chirag dude just admit it, you're being a pet for Dan like a lot of people. I have a lot more screenshots where you say DBH is shit, even after "meeting Dan".
mastermined - Milo let me point out to Wanting To Sue a Hosting Because Their ToS and PP Kind of Looks the same How do you know there was actual legal action against a TOS and Privacy Policy because as I see there is nothing included on that screenshot you provided of Dan saying he would sue for "copyright Infringement" of ToS and Privacy Policy.
mastermined - mastermined also drop me a dm, I want to have contact with you.
Chirag - Xcyth send?
Xcyth - Chirag if I have the time to find them sure
Solo - I don't care about the drama at all, but just in case anyone feels the need to defend DBH.
All of this is 100% true,  and there's much more stuff that's not known to the public.

I had nothing to do with this post or knew it was in the making.
mastermined - Solo neither do I
Xcyth - same
Deveroonie - Milo Nodes Being Down 90% of the time and Never being Fixed

cap. Nodes are at 90% uptime

Milo Donator's Paying for a Node that is always down

n7: 82&amp; uptime,
n15: 99% uptime

Milo Tickets Being opened for 6+ Months and Dan never responding

the oldest ticket is 2 months

Milo Dan Banned him

no, he left

Milo Screen Shot Solo Sent (there were more that got deleted by Dan)

fake ss

Milo There are over 1k Servers on Node 7.

epic games. blame them

Milo When he does he Feels the need to Spam ping @everyone

cap

Milo . (Take this with a Grain of Salt)

i will, it's cap

Milo Tickets Being opened for 5+ Months

oldest ticket: 2 months

Milo even a old ticket that would be 9 months old by now

capppppppppppp

Milo These Tickets are all over 1 month old.

agreed, i see my ticket in there
FC5570 - Deveroonie Not being rude, but can I get proof for the first statement - "Nodes are at 90% uptime" please? Donators (who donated for their node), waited for months, and then dan announced he was gonna reset the node, some nodes have been offline for weeks. I'm not saying dan doesn't care about the host or stuff, he does plus he has a job aswell, but he has to put some sort of limit to the servers a user can own so the nodes don't get flooded with servers.
FC5570 - And the oldest ticket is not 2 month old, one has been there for 4 months.
FC5570 - Why blame epic games? I don't understand, what the problem is with y'all blaming epic game nitro users for the servers on node 7. Their nitro expired ages ago, dan just has to remove around 800 servers of those boosters so Node 7 will be perfectly fine again, but I guess he's getting a completely new node and removing node 7 now.
Xcyth - Deveroonie ok fangirl stfu, all of the things mentioned in the post is a 100% true and you can't deny it. its also not the case that they are speaking without proof, they have given proper concrete proof.
Solo - Deveroonie I have... so many questions, most of your replies are based on dan's message as if dan would never lie.
If this keeps going I might consider posting some of the DMS between me and dan, to prove that everything in this ticket is very true.
Sliden - ok but that game server node doe
AVIXITY - among us and yeah
owoSctrz - "Why To Blame Free Nitro"
I remember in January 2021 Node was Good bots weren't lagging but as dan shifted n7 to ovh it was having problems and These problems Weren't fixed yet and Epic Games Nitro Came and Destroyed almost whole node People kept suggesting dan stop giving epic games nitro Servers But he didn't care and it lead to this When The node was Stable It was getting rate limited by discord after  sometime node on  wings outrage server weren't starting at all in previous 4 Months That's what I guess
owoSctrz - "90% downtime"
Only node 18 has 100% downtime from last month's every node is ok ok

mastermined - Milo that is called privacy for some reasons so I can‚Äôt share DMs with Xcyth, after all there is nothing in there. Just some conversation, nothing related to DBH.
mastermined - mastermined also I want to know the reasons you not contacting me on discord
DiscordUser - mastermined mastermind there is so much fucking proof that is stacked up against dbh right now
DiscordUser - Rosie should be added back to dbh, would be a great addition to the hell hole right now.

DiscordUser - allmohrac Stop stealing my ideas you rude boy
Microwave - rosie cool lol
mastermined - DiscordUser this person actually pointed out something false, and asking me to leak dms of a person and literally refusing to contact me on discord. Sorry bud but the ToS and pp point is not confirmed.
allmohrac - DiscordUser who
DiscordUser - Microwave STOP STEALING MY IDEASSSS!!!!!!
FadedSkies - Yes
mastermined - DiscordUser the point should be the lawsuit threat
mastermined - mastermined not ToS and PP
Jamie_ - I personally have had a good experience with Dan and DanbotHosting (Apart from the downtime which I agree really needs working on and tickets.) He recently announced today that everything is changing to I suggest we all wait. This could be the change DBH needs to fix all these issues pointed out in this post.
DinoTheDev - Jamie_ True tho he should've been doing it from the beginning
Jamie_ - DinoTheDev Well then think of it as a learning experience. Nobody gets it perfect from the start. Nobody. And if anyone says they have, utter BS. We all make mistakes as I have learnt and they can be fixed. So I hope that this V2 will fix everything.
DinoTheDev - Jamie_ still should have some common sense to ACTUALLY remove illegal servers and actually do what he said he's gonna do
BaconPowered - guys don‚Äôt worry DBH is best free host and will fix all issue so keep it up Dan you got it my bro keep up the good work üòé üòé
Solo - Deveroonie cap

Kid, you're not even a donator. I would post proof of that being true, but for some reason the money and time i donated doesn't get me the donator role ü§£ 

and i would go thru everything else, but judging from the fact that you're message contained the word "cap" more than it contained spaces (" ") i don't think that's required lmao.
BaconPowered - Solo did you try donate your life saving?
Solo - BaconPowered maybe... but we don't talk about that üò≥
BaconPowered - Solo I donated my body to DBH
Solo - DinoTheDev dude fuck that, it should be common sense not to DDoS people LMFAO.
BaconPowered - Solo he ddos the server together to improve security. it is a new technique created by zap hosting to ddos the server to improve security.
BaconPowered - and the machine ddos protection partner take a few notes while they were test to improve the server security together
Solo - BaconPowered Yes! I completely agree DDoSing someone's home network is the best way to report vulnerabilities, especially if the person whom you're helping, can't get online to check your vulnerability report!
BaconPowered - Solo but the ddos protection partner was talking notes to improve their ddos protection and security together!
Xcyth - yo jamal @BaconPowered could you kindly go fuck yourself
BaconPowered - yo jamal @Xcyth could you kindly go fuck yourself
BaconPowered - guys why DBH staff team have so few staff members?
z_t0ht - Giyu Oh dang you think my mum got railed think again dumbass your parents left you for being dumb and not touching grass üòÜ
z_t0ht - and who tf invited you here
Solo - z_t0ht you're acting stupid, stop
z_t0ht - Solo mhm ok sir solo
DinoTheDev - Solo idk if you deleted the messages or not I still don't have a side on that yet
Giyu - z_t0ht atleast i didnt started the whole fight for trying to protect dans ass meanwhile there is already proof showing how shitty the host is
Giyu - also dbh got some shitty seo btw
Giyu - yes yes, the github username have much better seo - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-10-07/1633650537-470050-image.png
DinoTheDev - Giyu there site seo is shit to they really need update their site plus there icon the home page doesn't load
Milo - lmao
Kowone - Milo Chirag was caught in DBH using PowerCord. This Breaks ToS(Don't whine about it saying "Oh It breaks ToS but Discord doesn't care" Cool, DBH still Bans for it and has before.) So Someone (Not Naming Names) Showed him Using Powercord in Staff chat to ask to Ban him. Well He got Banned so he went and cried to Dan's Dm's, So Dan in Staff news Spam Pinged Warning staff that He(Chirag) was allowed to use it and Nobody else. So Staff chat went crazy. I will just leave the images below for you to see

pretty sure discord doesn't care if people uses powercord or no, they can't really prevent that from happening
allmohrac - üçî
borgir
Milo - Kowone pretty sure discord doesn't care if people uses powercord or no, they can't really prevent that from happening

I legit knew someone was gonna Say This. DBH Rules stated that you are Not to be breaking ToS. PowerCord and Better Discord Break ToS(Even If they don't Care) So he should have been Banned. 

Note: This Post is not to hate on Dan. Stop being annoying about stuff (Dino)
DinoTheDev - Milo bro i have like 5 maybe even less posts on this thread about dan ü§£
Milo - DinoTheDev I'm Talking About in DBH's Discord Server.
DinoTheDev - Milo i have like 2 messages about him there....... tf are you on
DevNoah - Milo I have VODs disabled on my stream, but I have given Dan permission to "stress test" (DOS) my panel anytime he has taken it down
Milo - DevNoah Fine, But do you own the servers? If not than you do not have the right to give Permission Since it will affect other customer's.
DevNoah - Milo The servers themselves are equipped with DDOS Protection, and they wouldn't affect additional customers as at the time the hosting company themselves said it was alright to stress test the DDOS Protection they advertised, which in my interpretation allows me the right to give Dan permission to DOS my panel. I'm not sure what the companies guidelines are now and/or if they changed, but at the time I was allowed to give Dan that permission.
Milo - DevNoah If the company Allows it Fine. I will take back All I have said about Dan DDoS'ing you.
DevNoah - Milo Appreciate it, I don't want to have false information flowing around, especially on a topic like this where both sides of the story are extremely important.

Have a great rest of your night!
DinoTheDev - DevNoah off topic but noah for some reason your pfp is perfect
DevNoah - DinoTheDev Oh ik, perfect moment, I love it
DinoTheDev - DevNoah no cap
Thominek - anyone gimme their discord link
Sliden - discord.gg/dbh
Thominek - thanks
owoSctrz - Hi
FC5570 - bye
BaconPowered - DevNoah bro no need to defend we all know he ddos your server to improve security together because ddos protection partner was take a few notes
DinoTheDev - this thread died quickly
Milo - DinoTheDev I could post more info. I'm Just waiting on Dan to decide.

Milo - Iceey Hey Iceey. This "Lawsuit" happened weeks ago. I only brought light to it Since Dan was Publicly talking about it. This thread is to bring No drama to DBH. The posts are trying to get Dan's head out of his ass. I've been talking to him in DM's.
Iceey - Milo They've stolen my legal work. I'm going to get their ass handed to them.
Milo - Iceey Hi Iceey. Is there any proof of this?
FatGrizzly - Milo soon:tm:
Iceey - You'll see when I've filed everything
Milo - Iceey I doubt there is any proof than. I don't see why you don't just show us proof if there is.
FatGrizzly - Milo hes writing it rn ig
Milo - FatGrizzly May I have the link's of where They stole the Tos, PP and RP?
Iceey - Milo I'm writing my own thread thanks and I think my word should be enough for now
_MrKnight_ - Iceey is one of the best person in drama.gg who knows law and stuff pretty good, and he writes tos ,pp for clients so I think he will have the proof
Milo - Iceey If its about DBH just post it here? There is no point in making more threads.
FatGrizzly - _MrKnight_ no!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

_MrKnight_ - Milo This thread is some shitty off topic thread just scroll up and u can see 3yo kids fighting over s name so it's better to make a good thread

Milo - LoneWolf Dan has been a cool dude to me,

Ah Yes. He is Nice to one person so he is Nice to everyone else?

LoneWolf tickets its a free host

You can Buy premium servers? Someone has a old ticket (That is still open to my knowledge) where someone paid and still never got their servers. 

LoneWolf Dan has fixed node 7

He has Not fixed it. He just released a New paid node.

LoneWolf Now for my end stop arguing over a host if you dont like it leave stop making drama people like and hate a host its fine just stop spreading things outside of it.

Look, Are you retarded? This post is to get Dan's head out of his ass. Guess what. It has. People should know what Dan has done in the past. I still got a ton of info on Dan.
Dragonizedpizza - Your English scares me.

Than doesn't mean then. 
Capitalization is unnecessary (He will Say? Solo Had).
Using a when supposed to use an. 

I don't care if none of these things matter, its the fact that you screw them up that hints at your age.
DiscordUser - Dragonizedpizza And your retardedness scares me. 
You posted a literally virus .deb in DBH and after you was banned you was like "OH I DIDNT CHECK THE FILE SO IT WASNT MY FAULLTTTT."
I don't care if none of these things matter, its the fact that you screw them up that hints at your fucking stupidness level.
DiscordUser - And we are all not perfect, so why the fuck are you calling someone out for not using grammar, when you yourself aint perfect.
Iceey - Why you calling out hitler when you got cancelled on twitter that one time
owoSctrz - "He has Not fixed it. He just released a New paid node."
he has already said he will delete n7 and we have almost 2 weeks after it he will fully delete n7  
and also he asked everyone that he should do it or not - https://cdn.sctrz.only-fans.club/9znS

Dragonizedpizza - DiscordUser Please know what you're talking about. 
First, the deb was clean, the zip was the virus.
Second, me saying I didn't know was simply an excuse to be clear of my actions.
Third, I didn't screw anything up? All of my actions are intentional, and I regret none of them.
Fourth, me posting a virus doesn't lead to me being a retard if it was intentional. Retard means a delay, or to be held back.

...Retard.
