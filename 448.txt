Deleted User - And then just blocked me - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-03/1620067425-745236-image.png
Tomas - ok and
Slayer - There is a reason why Juicy did that
Deleted User - Slayer Yeah, a very childish reason. He could've taken his things he made and removed it. It was technically still me who owned the whole thing, as i had the license to the WHMCS and i owned the dedicated server. The only thing he owned was the US node and the webhosting.
INfoUpgraders - learn how to secure your stuff bro
Toki0179 - Slayer Even if there is a reason. I'm not choosing sides but its kinda over the top doing this. You realise the person that did this didn't just fuck the host over. He made clients lose data too.
Toki0179 - But on the other side. He should have made sure everything was secure and also backups exist
Deleted User - Toki0179 Everything was secure, EpicJuicy was a founder and that way he had access to the dedicated server. We had SSH Keys and 2fa on the server.. And we changed the SSH port.
Deleted User - Also Juicy it doesnt help deleting your account and creating a new one. People will find that account aswell.. lol
Tomas - Difference between.

He was trusted supposedly and the destroyed that trust for a reason that's probably stupid

Deleted User - Franklin Clinton account is EpicJuicy
Slayer - Znilla ðŸ™‚ The guy who made oceannodes should have removed perms from Frankin Clinton too but he was probably panicking so much that he couldn't ðŸ˜ƒ
Deleted User - Slayer "The guy"? You should fix yourself mate, you raided it all.. Its not okay. lol
Slayer - Znilla Internet things are so bad ðŸ˜±
Tomas - Slayer spittin facts bro
Deleted User - Thats sad, now they shut down. But still. OCEANNODES.COM SHOULD HAVE HAD SECURITY TO PREVENT THIS, &amp; REMOVE EPICJUICY WHEN HE SAID HE SAID HE WAS GONNA NUKE THE VPS!
Deleted User - @18#13405 It wasnt a VPS, it was a dedicated server. And we did not have time to remove him, he instantly deleted the files..
