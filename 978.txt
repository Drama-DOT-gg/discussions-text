Koneko-XeinHostFounder - Hello, my name is Daniel and i'm founder of XeinHost hosting service. Our WHMCS is not nulled. It was installed from official WHMCS website and license was bought from WHMCS too. Proofs . On screenshot you see that the license was canceled due to unabling to pay for it. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-09-11/1631349222-145348-screenshot-20210911-113035-brave.jpg
Koneko-XeinHostFounder - Also, I want to point that our hosting is closed so I don't think that the post is needed.
Jerome - Koneko-XeinHostFounder It's still illegal to do so, you need to shut down your website. Doesn't matter you are operating or not, WHMCS could send you a DMCA takedown letter for doing so.
NicoleH - Jerome You can refer to this link ANNOUNCEMENT And the proof above. The license was never nulled and isn't running anymore. I made an account just to look at it. They have stated (On all platoforms) That they where shutting that hosting company down. It's not unusual for a company to leave their services running till either they are purchased by a different company or asked by a provider to take it down. A DMCA Takedown on this is overkill. 

On other note it just seems like you are here to start drama about something that was already disproven. No-where in the cancellation process does it state that you would have to take your work down. 

I could change my mind buy this company from it's respectful owners and keep the same domain / name running on a renewd license. This happens quite alot and I've done it before.

If you wish to discuss further on a civilised matter then you can find me here!

Tomas - You could've also just checked the admin page - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-09-11/1631381528-834181-image.png
Jamie_ - Tomas Ah Jerome. Another case of you using your ass instead of your eyes.
Two - I'm pretty sure WHMCS still allows you to have the client area up after it expires to keep people who bought something running, but you can't do anything on the administrator page. Also, "nulled" is the incorrect term for what you were talking about Jerome. They got it from the official WHMCS site.
Jerome - Tomas Seem like it's a false positive from WHMCS.
