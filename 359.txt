DeadBushMC - This Minecraft Server called Rushcraft is a 1.16.5 MC java server. The owner acts like he is 9 years old. Bans people for such a weird reason. K ill explain stuff now.
First I was begged to join in dm by one of their owners.
They believing on fake news which is really old anyway, He didn't listen to me when I try to tell him it's fake and stuff and in return, he replied he is a hacker and he used to ruin peoples lives and when I asked what language is used in hacking his answer was coding. Even a child knows that coding is used but he doesn't know what language lmao XD.    he said he made a game using unreal engine and I asked what language this is what happened  .

Their server is super laggy even on 2 players. And the owner bans people for critising. A guy said the server is shit and he was banned and how is that a reason to ban someone.  . When I asked how is that a reason to ban then they immideatly made a new rule  .  That a shitty rules the owner completly took rights to critise from his players.  .  And later since I started to expose them they unbanned the guy and he was made to say thier server is the best server when that's the most shittiest server I've ever seen 

Go to their discord server and critise them then you will get banned lmao. I got banned too https://discord.gg/vNJSmNSNr4 - https://i.imgur.com/cx2vWJD.png

AlphaDarky - DeadBushMC thats retarded
yhvr - why do they start every word with an uppercase letter? that kinda bothers me
Bxrk - this is for hosts, not minecraft servers?
Jedrik - Bxrk If you could read you'd see we're expanding into different topics, moving away from specifically hosting
Axel229 - Hello to everyone here, im a rushcraft mod.
We have some explain to do. Deadbush, you talked only with amber actually but not without other people, so you cant say that the owner is rude, everyone has is problems, and lots of time she was joking, we are a really nice staff, im trying every day to make the 3/4 people that chat in a good conversation. About chirag, he's right, it WAS a pay to win server. Now, we are redoing ranks, so people can stay better in the server. If you have any question to do, you can enter the server or dm. (Just don't grief the MC server like Chirag lol) im trying to do the most nicely job as mod, like everyone of the servers should be. Hope i didn't waste your time. Have a nice day!
Axel229 - DeadBushMC 
Try also talking with the mods, we will try our best to make the server more comfortable even with the "rude owner" 
Also, i had a little conversation with a member called Cyda, if you know her ask if I was rude or nice 😛
Bxrk - Jedrik - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-04-10/1618021856-854108-a784e75c64f59c4281ed47864e84e421.png
Bxrk - lamaker go brr
DeadBush - Axel229 Lmao that's the most trashiest excuse I ever saw. Everyone says it was a joke after performing sins. You thinking creating those rules are joke where people don't have freedom of speech? And the owner literally says it's my server I have rights to ban you. And the owner literally even banned people for no freaking reason. And you call all that a joke? Your server owner literally dms people to beg to buy ranks. You guys had creative mode Access, anticheat bypass in Legend rank. You ain't going away by giving shitty excuse
DeadBush - Axel229 and your owner is a person who never listens to anyone I gave him a lot of suggestions to stop this stuff he says I know nothing about server. He literally said he opened server for money indirectly in my dms. I'm on this things for 4-5 years and he says I know nothing when he didn't prolly even knows anything about it. I told him fix the rules he didn't
DeadBush - Axel229 Your owner was literally begging me to invest on his server 

Trying to scam me to invest in his server 🤣 as if I'm dumb enough to fall for 



And indirectly he says he opened server for money - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-04-10/1618027447-332893-screenshot-2021-04-10-09-23-19-065-comdiscord.jpg

DeadBush - No offence to anyone 1st he is in India so should have expected that.
Plus we literally know he is a kid.
Get hyped more spicy stuff coming up by me, chrag and cyda
AlphaDarky - Axel229 Hmm would you like to unban me then Your owner false banned me for swearing
AlphaDarky - DeadBush hmm you forgot to say about the shitty rules especially the ban if you say bad about server
Deleted User - DeadBush the person admitted to be 19, and the truth is, we know he's underage to use Discord.
Deleted User - Guys the ban is just a joke. And why the people that banned, not yet got their unban? - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-04-10/1618035335-349814-screenshot-2021-04-10-14-12-49-87.png
Deleted User - Forgot to point out that their mod is also as shit as the server owner. The server owner is planning on making the server a P2W server.
AlphaDarky - Chycada well he was swearing im pretty sure so expected (the moderator)
Axel229 - Chycada 
Actually, is not the ban joke. But some people doesn't get a joke,like on begging nitro ecc...
Axel229 - AlphaDarky 
When i sweared exactly, im really sorry for that
Axel229 - Chycada 
We're reworking on ranks, it's not anymore pay2win, I studied it 1 hour and even if it can seems p2w it's not, just create a ticket or dm me
Axel229 - Chycada 
Those are 2 separated things, joke. Then, about the ban, the server is shit, rules n5 no swearing
Deleted User - DeadBushMC P2W OWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWO
DeadBushMC - Axel229 First your owner begs for nitro and to buy ranks. Second If your owner is joking for begging then why not other joke too? He literally banned people for saying shit and saying server is bad or laggy. Everyone says its a joke after getting badly exposed. Joke isnt an excuse better get with better excuse
AlphaDarky - @Axel229 Would you like to unban me then your owner banned me for swearing when i didn't
AlphaDarky - Axel229 even if no one swears while saying ur server is garbage you still ban them
AlphaDarky - fix that^^
Axel229 - AlphaDarky 
I never ban people for this, we don't want swears, you can say it's garbage but say WHY and try to be nice
Axel229 - @DeadBushMC#104999
We know it can seems real, but it's srsly a joke, you don't have to bother about it, just say that's annoying, now she's changing and it's trying to being more nice.
You have to say if you don't feel good in the server!
AlphaDarky - @DeadBushMC You had a ss of them banning a guy for saying their mc server bad right?
Axel229 - DeadBushMC 
If you think it's an excuse, it's ok it's your mind and you think what you want. But she did that on me, and casually now I'm a friend of the owner, those are little jokes that she do. Try talking a bit more and read the rules, swearing isn't admitted in the server, and at least try to say why and what it's trash of it
Axel229 - AlphaDarky 
I'm not sure actually it happened, im not defending the server cuz maybe it happened when I was offline
DeadBushMC - AlphaDarky yes u can check up the first thread
DeadBushMC - Axel229 bro I seriously have the ss of people getting banned for saying the server is bad and plus the rule says you can't say bad about the server. I probably have more sense of humor than you since you are not able to understand what is going on here in this thread. I understand the joke and I can differentiate between joke and abuse. Ill post more ss soon
Axel229 - DeadBushMC 
Read rules. N5 no swearing even without the rule n11 it was still bannable. Rules exist for something please read it
DeadBushMC - Axel229 bro if you are talking about all rules then first your owner himself or herself have broken whole lot of rules. And if you say that HiveMC biggest bedrock server read their rules no one follow their rules and still roams in the server. Rules can be broken sometimes but you guys straight up ban people for breaking rules even once. And I have ss of your owner saying the guy to say good thing about the server or he will be banned. Its like clearly saying Thief blames other thief for stealing the money he stole from others
Axel229 - DeadBushMC 
Again, it's joking if you don't get it it's ok
DeadBushMC - Axel229 and your owner ays he or she is 19 years old right. In my opinion he/she is not even 13 years old. We want a proof that he/she isnt underage or you are illegal on discord
DeadBushMC - Axel229 stfu bitch ass do you have brain? Banning people is a joke? Banning people for saying server is bad is a joke? i have ss people getting banned and thats a joke?
DeadBushMC - Axel229 and plus why was I banned for saying the server rules dont make sense? I didnt even swore in the server? I was banned for critisim?
DeadBushMC - Axel229 or was I banned for not investing in the server when your owner begged
Axel229 - DeadBushMC 
Why are you being like this, you don't need to be toxic try being nice it's not ban joke, ban is for breaking the rules
Axel229 - You got banned bc you do like this, if you do sarcasm and ur annoying it's obvious that she ban you, that's why we want a nice community. Not everyone get sarcasm!
Axel229 - And you aren't reading all my post here, bc I said you can say is trash but at least say WHY and say it nicely
Axel229 - Also, if you think some rules doesn't make sense make a ticket or dm a mod, all have an explain
DeadBushMC - Axel229 lmao sarcasm is joke. And plus as you said your owner was joking right? how was he joking when he dosent know sarcasm? Your discord server dosent even have freedom of speech and rights to critise its worse than dictatorship. And i was banned for sarcasm funny enough
DeadBushMC - Axel229 no one listened lmao I messed owner he is responsible so i dmed him for it he said im annoying him by suggesting him stuffs. Adn he blocked me and you supposed me to fucking tell it to everyone
DeadBushMC - Axel229 this place is meant to be toxic
LogicApples - in short: It's a bad and unprofessional server.....
DeadBushMC - Axel229 after providing valid proof which is screenshot of the chat everyone agrees your server is shit and you are the only one here tryna defend. and can you ask your owner to prove his/her age
Deleted User - Axel229 oh, that shitty shitcraft owner joking? I can't detect any jokes in his words. If he's joking. I don't really think he made a good joke, probably a very bad one.
Deleted User - Axel229 

Axel229 Also, i had a little conversation with a member called Cyda, if you know her ask if I was rude or nice 😛

I could agree that you're a chill person
Axel229 - Chycada 
Ik sometimes she's bad btw, now it's changing a bit
Deleted User - Axel229 hope he's changing his attitude toward others. He's basically shittier than my very toxic little cousin.
Axel229 - DeadBushMC 
Look, every proof actually isn't a real one in discord. Everything could be photoshopped and everyone can lie. There isnt a really proof, that's why we trust each other
Axel229 - Sorry for my bad English lol
Axel229 - Chycada 
Yes, she's changing and now she will try to be like me
DeadBushMC - Axel229 lmao by proof she/he is indian right? so he/she can take pic of aadhar card there should be pic of background too and plus he/she can hide the critcal info like adress and adhaar number. with edit and Im good enough to defrenciate between edit and real.
DeadBushMC - Axel229 the way your owner is doing like this is the same as robbing a bank and saying to police its a joke buddy.
Axel229 - This is starting to getting really srs.
One guy entered in the server saying he wants to donate, unfortunately the owner didn't create an alternative PayPal account like i said to her. Please guys don't do this things, it's bad and it's illegal, if you think server is trash just don't enter it you don't have to do this things. Please, be nice AND DONT DO THIS THINGS. Hope you understand how much this is getting srs
Axel229 - DeadBushMC 
Ik she's was wrong even if actually she was joking. Now she's changing in a more nice person. Don't think anymore of that, she will never do it again.
Axel229 - Also, please remove the invite this is getting really srs
DeadBushMC - Axel229 no
DeadBushMC - Axel229 things like this always get serious and this place is about exposing stuff and no one stops once something starts. And im just gathering proofs and uploading here If anything else happens im not responsible for that. Cuz im banned and since ur server is java i dont even have mc java
Axel229 - Ur a lawyer and a programmer, why do you have to spend your life like this, this is totally useless.
DeadBushMC - Axel229 well you guys are already doing a lot of bad stuffs already and we dont want people to fall in this so its not useless it actually good to expose scuffed stuffs
DeadBushMC - he banned for saying server is trash again - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-04-10/1618048203-203845-image.png
DeadBushMC - he banned for saying server is trash again - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-04-10/1618048211-656867-image.png
Chirag - Axel229 1. He ain't a lawyer
This is fun tbh
Axel229 - DeadBushMC 
Let me explain.
Ban thing: FOLLOW RULES, even if in other server rules can be breaked bot in this, this is really important.
Begging thing: she was joking and, ofc, she will never ask it srsly.
Asking money thing: it's "asking" you can say no and if she say why and those things you can block her.
Now she's also changing. She will not doing again those things.
P2w, all have been remade, and even if it can seems p2w it's not, just ask and everything will be explained.
What did I forgot?
Oh the think that one of our friends can get hacked for this. Do we really need to degenerate? Cmon.
Axel229 - Chirag 
So he lied
Axel229 - DeadBushMC 
Some hour ago, now it's different.
Axel229 - It's ok that you want people to know it's trash and other things. But there is risk of getting hacked.
DeadBushMC - Axel229 First begging and asking is different your owner tried to show me greed to invest so better stfu in that topic. and about rules how is saying bad about server bannable is a rule?
DeadBushMC - Axel229 I never said im a lawyer?
I just told ur owner basic rules about cyber laws just to prevent him from comitting cyber crime. And he was the one to give me lawyer role himself
Axel229 - DeadBushMC 
Rule n5 SWEARING ISNT ADMITTED
DeadBushMC - Axel229 well but people get banned for saying the server is bad and I was banned for critism i didnt even swore and i was banned
Axel229 - Saying is shit it's not ok. Saying it's trash and explain why it's ok
DeadBushMC - Axel229 and plus dude you deserve bettter place than RushCraft
Axel229 - Oh and chirag got banned for griefing the server
DeadBushMC - Axel229 well saying server is trash is critisim and everyone has rights to critise
Axel229 - DeadBushMC 
Look, I have like 6 friends in total, I don't wanna lose them
DeadBushMC - Axel229 since you guys follow rule right? there wasnt any rule which said greifing = ban
Axel229 - DeadBushMC 
Dude he griefed the server minecraft used nuker and destroyed the hub
DeadBushMC - Axel229 dont get in peer pressure cuz of that you deserve way better if u want we are there as your friends
DeadBushMC - Axel229 was it in rule destroying hub == ban? and wait let me post a very ong thread which will shut everyone
Axel229 - DeadBushMC 
I've always been loyal with everyone. Everyone deserve a second chance, and every friend deserve another one. I can be "friend" with you guys, but I'll never betray rushcraft friends. With friends I'm really loyal.
Axel229 - Too much friends word in this post xD
DeadBushMC - Ok here

Cyda exposed them


Clear abusing 


the one who acts like 10 i dont even think he is 12+ says anotehr as kid


Will ban the mod if he tries to solve everything peacfully but owner wants him to be rude to the exposers or he will get banned

Didn't Read Mokang EULA and Dosent know wtf is Pay 2 Win and Creating a Server XD


When asked what host do you use says we dont use any free host kinda sus but ok. The server was super laggy unplayble in 4 players tho tps was like 12-13. He ddint say what host and kept ignoring the message when asked


And they say they follow the rules strictly but there was no rule saying you cannot grief the server and still chirag was banned ik its common sense but according to them theyll ban only if rule is broken since chirag ddint break any rule mentioned but still he was banned lmao 

Anything else you need as proof? @Axel229 - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-04-10/1618050881-248969-inkedscreenshot-2021-04-10-00-02-29-970-comdiscord-li.jpg
DeadBushMC - Ok here

Cyda exposed them


Clear abusing 


the one who acts like 10 i dont even think he is 12+ says anotehr as kid


Will ban the mod if he tries to solve everything peacfully but owner wants him to be rude to the exposers or he will get banned


Changes Colour Faster Than a Chameleon


Ban people for critising? fuck freedom of speech we gonna have a dictator aka sucessful server with only 4 mods online in the server


He Broke Rule 12 lmao that rule says you cant say bad about server like wtf where is freedom of speech people cant say if server is bad


He ahs no other excuses now so He said if Cyda getting paid for critising XD


Ban someone again? I didn't see any rule breaker there at that time


It clearly Means If Someone is robbing the bank you will rob too.


The ranks were totally p2w example Legend rank had access to creative mod and bypass anticheat. And chirag had access to their luck perms so basically false adv if im not wrong and lying the ranks were not made

DeadBushMC - Axel229 buddy you aint a dog to be loyal to your master. Basically they are using you as their servant. Br tough you deserve better. You can find way better friends than them. You gonna learn nothing from them cuz you ddint even knew what p2w was. Find some good friends who can teach you stuff and be with you instead of using you
LogicApples - agreed. Just bad people
Axel229 - DeadBushMC 
Actually I know what is p2w lol, i was about to tell it to amber that the ranks were p2w until well, chirag did it
DeadBushMC - Axel229 nah in the pic you clearly asked what is p2w dont lie
Axel229 - I asked it to chirag only to try not being bad lol
Axel229 - (Reworked ranks by me it can seems p2w but isn't just ask if you have any question)

It's not much but at least it's something
DeadBushMC - Axel229 nah bro you guys are the trashiest to make excuse get some better excuse that aint gonna work. we are on this exposing thing from long and we know what kind of excuses people make lmfao. You still have time tho you are not with right people
DeadBushMC - Axel229 who tf wants to play with trash mods?

and not only rank 99% of the server is completly scuffed. you guys are making it without any knowledge - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-04-10/1618051676-652045-image.png
Axel229 - DeadBushMC 
I mean if you think it's an excuse it's ok.
If I quit rushcraft I will have no friends as always (':
DeadBushMC - Axel229 yes it is an excuse and if you arent quitting rushcraft just because you will have no friends then im there, chirag is there and a lot of us are there and we can teach you a lot of things as well
Axel229 - DeadBushMC
I dont think that you guys likes me at all
DeadBushMC - Axel229 we never said we hate you? if you wanna come you are welcome. We never had issues with you you are a pretty chill person if you want you can dm me on discord. we had issues with the server and owner not you
Axel229 - My English sucks, I'm shy, I'm bad finding friends. The only good thing on me is that I'm kinda good at editing videos and the thing that I always try to make my friends laughs. Do you think I'm a good friend? /:
DeadBushMC - Axel229 yes you are an absolutely good friend you tried defending rush craft alone when owner didnt give a damn about it. You dont need to find friends there are already a lot peole like us
Chirag - DeadBushMC Uses Really Cheap Quality Hetzner VPS and Says Uses Apex

They use skynode.eu btw
DeadBushMC - Chirag yea prolly 3euros one scuz the server is super laggy
Deleted User - Chirag what the fuck? Skynode?
ShemBane - Chycada its a paid hosting service its been a thing since 2017 i think
DeadBush - ShemBane and I can Guarantee he used the 3euros vps with 512MB ram or max 13euros one with 2GB ram . I can tell that cuz
1st the owner is Indian
2nd Indian parents don't give money for games
3rd he was begging me to invest cuz he don't have money now
4th server was lagging hardcore like 500MB ram couldn't handle 4 players without lag tps was like 12-13
LogicApples - DeadBush nice pfp.
Chirag - DeadBush No, I can confirm that they are using a shared hosting. rushcraft.tk:25565 points to a geyser server and riskcraft.tk:19132 points to a PMMP server.
so it's a shared hosting which got nodes from skynode, by the fact that the server is extremely laggy, I can say it's a free hosting.
AlphaDarky - DeadBushMC i have java 🙂
Deleted User - ShemBane I see
Deleted User - LMFAO - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-04-10/1618064936-387216-screenshot-2021-04-10-22-27-20-65.png
