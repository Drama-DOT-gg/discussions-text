Jerome - First of all, the website uses WHMCS which clearly shows at his main page

and it's nulled. 

Second, their service is really cheap which makes me very suspicious

16 Cores, 1TB SSD, 32GB Ram for 2 EUR
However, you can sign up for their free service at their client area (https://dash.relefree.cf) and I lookup the IP.

and if you lookup the hostname, it's a hostname that frequently use to send attack, scam  and spam to other server. Feel free to Google search poneytelecom.eu if you want to know more about that.
and lastly they use Freenom domain, However, their previous domain is https://relehost.es which you can tell by looking at their TrustPilot
