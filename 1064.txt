It sells botnet at a very attractive low price, and frequently advertises that the price will increase. Before you pay, he will tell you that your account will be created as soon as the payment is confirmed. 
In fact, after you pay, he will say that he is not at home, on the road, upgrading the network capacity, and so on with some excuse to put you off indefinitely, and then slowly start ignoring the message until you give up on the matter.

There are dozens of hired Indians in his group, guys who are either partners in the scam, or brand new accounts.
I've since learned from a friend that this guy first sought out powerful botnets and requested free access to test them, and used that to trick customers into trusting him. The funny thing is that after his account was banned, he made an announcement that the reason he no longer offered free stress tests was because they were being used by customers for scams.
