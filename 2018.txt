Pelotudo_ - Hello, today I am here to show you the worst hosting that exists, its founder, Mr. Vainki, is an immature, dishonest, lying and childish person.

Pelotudo_ - Well, after showing how lowly vainki is, let's continue with what happened after Ajneb's assessment.  After this youtuber gave them a 0.3 starnode lost 80% of its users and thousands of reviews began to be published.  Now I want to tell you about the StarNode nodes, to begin with it goes without saying that they are Oracle free trials, every 30 days they turn off the nodes and change them saying that they are normal restarts, Mr. Vainki is a creepy person who abuses some free services to earn money.  Also, in his free time he is dedicated to screwing other people by throwing other people's nodes and erasing people's hard work. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-08-26/1661535808-572035-image.png

DarkKing - It's funny to see that they make deductions with arguments from 6 months ago, it's a shame that they start crying because starnode beat them in the competition.

Well, besides you are so stupid that you don't even dedicate yourselves to inform yourselves well the host Vyter is linked to starnode it's funny to see that you don't even know that yourselves.

You only give excuses but have no more arguments is funny to see that you complain because you do not achieve what one achieves only dedicated to make drama.gg without context and information about everything haha lmao

starnode may have had bugs months ago but all the hosts have had bugs but at least they don't rip people off like sharkhosting does hahahaha 

PS - If you have proof that you use Free Trial as you argue, show proof and we will believe you. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-08-26/1661539742-546000-wlop-48se.jpg
AngelGuerrero - DarkKing I would like to see starnode's invoices.
TheJulianJara - Pelotudo_ 

I don't understand what I have to do with this topic, but since I've been included, I'm here to comment on one thing. 

To begin with, Vyxterhost and StarNode are friendly hosts. 

I don't understand what my comment on YouTube has to do with it, when all I did was to thank Abnej for his opinion for the host and take it as feedback.

On the other hand, I find it very hypocritical of you to accuse without any kind of proof, although I don't like to get into this kind of "forums", I come to show you one more proof that SharkHost uses free nodes from IONOS.

A few days ago, I entered to SharkHost's Discord server and did a little research to see if they really use free IONOS nodes.

What gave me the certainty that they do, was the following:

As you can see, the CEO of SharkHost, had managed to get the free nodes and started again his scam towards the users.

Message of 7/17:


But the weird thing comes now, when just a month later (I want to emphasize that it was just in a month), the CEO woke up and realized that his free trials were over.

Message of 8/16:



Sincerely, I am very sorry that users fall for this type of scams and lies. 

In closing, I would like you to attach proof if possible, so that you can demonstrate that what you are saying is real and you are not just trying to defend or hide a lie. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-08-26/1661543500-869926-image.png

AngelGuerrero - TheJulianJara That's exactly what we want proof that starnode doesn't use free trials hahaha
Pelotudo_ - TheJulianJara I honestly don't know where it appears there that we use free host and that we don't pay. We have reported to Oracle and I am actually contacting them and I already have an answer when I have a clear answer to the situation I will comment on it
ImTheRealOne - You are literally a terrible stupid, misinformed and with very bad arguments, to begin with, you say that Starnode steals css code, and you show the page of VyxterHost, VYXTERHOST AND STARNODE ARE PRACTICALLY THE SAME, AND STARNODE IS BASED ON VYXTERHOST IDIOT, Well, seeing your CLEAR lack of information, I will continue arguing the terrible stupidity that you wrote, regarding the opinion of ajneb, the idiot (He is not really an idiot, but I feel that because of what he did he is) he decided to criticize the hosting when he WAS UNDER ATTACK XD, WHAT LOGIC DOES THAT HAVE WHEN HE IS SUPPOSED TO CRITICIZE HOW A HOST IS IN ITS "MAXIMUM EXPLENDOR" OR BETTER SAID A FINISHED HOST, STARNODE IS NOT FINISHED AND STILL DECIDED TO MAKE A CRITIQUE, it could not cost him to get a little information and read that the host was not finished yet, I think he had to make his criticism when the host was not under attack, and when it is finished because if not, it would not make any sense to criticize it, well, I WANT TO CLARIFY THAT I WROTE BO WITH CAPITAL LETTERS WHAT HE THINK IS MOST IMPORTANT, REGARDING VAINKI, HE DOES A GOOD JOB, WHEN IT COMES TO STARNODE HE IS SERIOUS AND TAKES EFFORT TO FIX BUGS AND SOLVE PEOPLE'S MISTAKES, YOU DON'T KNOW HIM AT ALL, HOW ARE YOU GOING TO THINK AND CRITICIZE SOMEONE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE LIKE OR WHO THEY ARE XD
Thank for reading, sorry for my bad translation, and have a good day.
AngelGuerrero - We are still waiting for the oracle invoices from starnode.

ImTheRealOne 🤣🤣🤣
DarkKing - AngelGuerrero As you argued in this drama why don't you show proof that free trial is used? because I only see a lot of blah blah but little evidence, and the funny thing is that you ask us to show pay receipts, so it shows that you have no proof of anything and your arguments are so low and taken from 6 months ago without having clear evidence of what you talk about, did it hurt you so much that shark closed completely?
LMAO
Pelotudo_ - ImTheRealOne good, first of all regarding ajneb, he did that review of the host because both vainki and many users wrote thousands of messages to them being able to, then regarding Vyterhost, I put the photo to show how vainki has literally copied the style of the panel that they use on vyterhost.  Finally, regarding what he criticized vainki without knowing him, you just know that I know vainki enough to know what an immature, lying and manipulative person is.  Thank you very much for your review, here is my answer.
Pelotudo_ - here we send one of the hundreds of tests that exist, to confirm that starnode uses freetrials, those messages are sent approximately every 30 days, but instead of deleting servers they make a backup and upload it to the new trials, saying that it is a maintenance. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-08-26/1661547859-336834-image.png
Alex_Milan - This thread is about starnode not sharkhost just stay on topic.
JustNotSebas - Pelotudo_ Looks like I have to say something about this as a StarNode's admin.

First of all, the last nodes reset was almost 2 months ago, on June 28. It was because the panel's database was corrupted and we had to restart everything to fix some errors because of this. So, almost 2 months later, it's impossible to a free node to stay up THAT much time. And there wasn't any nodes change in this period. Still the same ips, even numerical ones.

Now, to the CSS code: VyxterHost and StarNode are linked and the owners have work together, so there's no copy. 

Now this:

Pelotudo_ this hosting was rated by Ajneb himself, and he gave it a score of 0.3/10 due to its lag, bugs, errors and much more.

Ajneb tested the host in a date that the host was still, not even on beta, but a pre-beta phase. Obviously the host was full of errors and bugs, so there's the point. But now, a lot of time later, the host has changed. A lot of problems had been fixed and the stability is a lot better.

So how about you test the host yourselves (When the dashboard is up, and before you say something, MAINTENANCE, THERE'S NOTHING WRONG ABOUT THE DASHBOARD ON MAINTENANCE.) and tell me how your perspective changed. 

— JustNotSebas#7887
DarkKing - Pelotudo_ Currently it has already exceeded 30 days and still the same nodos..... apparently the fuck they have given to sharkhost has hurt too much XD
DarkKing - Alex_Milan What, were you hurt by the news of the sharkhost scam, wow wow?
DarkKing - It's funny to see how they argue things only based on things from 6 months ago zzzzz so hurt they are by the fall of sharkhost is normal, make excuses and make tiraderas with old messages zzzz

I know your tails have been hurting from what happened so don't worry whatever you do it doesn't change the fact that sharkhost scammed and starnode is higher up than sharkhost.
DarkKing - And why continue commenting on this drama if at the end of the day the fuck they have received and no one takes them out, by the way if both are looking for us to pass the ballot to see if we pay the nodes if it was published in starnode just look through all messages 

But I know they will not do it because they do not have time to inform themselves to such an extent that they use messages from months ago to make this drama.

Lastly, I know that you will pretend that nothing has hurt you but inside you are dying so much that you have been hiding everything and changing your name many times so that people would not know that you were scammers. 

Now all the sharkhost support is dedicated to enter starnode to try to threaten with ddos attacks but as they are children who do not even know where they stand even one of your staff threatened ddos and commented "I'm going to throw the dash" being that the dash is out of maintenance hahahahahahaahaha

I don't know whether to laugh or cry at what is happening with kids like you who are just whining about getting caught with your scam.

So see you, by the way close this drama because you have already been caught 3 times zzzzz
thus avoiding such humiliation

Jellz - i loveeee the drama kids fighting over who has the best host with free trials, please continue thank you. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-08-26/1661556854-195857-image.png
DarkKing - SharkHost  - 'Oracle Free Trial' and it was proven to such an extent that all the nodes were cancelled hahaha
Pelotudo_ - DarkKing Do you have proofs?

If it's not, don't say that not even Starnode is as good as you think there are many things you don't know about this host from people threatening to send videos of a girl with  cancer3aped  I'm not going through all this because I'm holding back but it's going to see everything one day that everything is going to be filtered ..
DarkKing - Pelotudo_ Do you have proof?

I only see that you talk and talk with such stupid arguments even now you put a girl with cancer? wtf why do not you show the evidence that you talk so much, it costs so much to pass a couple of tests?
DarkKing - Pelotudo_ As the saying goes, "If a dog barks, it doesn't bite". 
so are you right now, you just give invalid arguments without evidence why don't you send proof? so upset that it was exposed that SharkHost used free trial and was closed for scamming people?
DarkKing - Pelotudo_ I challenge you to send the evidence that you "talk so much" because I only see a lot of blah blah x both sides.

instead starnode did show things and thanks to that many people knew that sharkhost scammed and lied to people, they even have the nerve to send staff threaten another host SO LOW HAVE THEY FALLEN.

Why "IF THEY DO NOT DO ANYTHING WRONG WHY FEAR?" but as if they have done something wrong that's why they are like bitches looking for attention.
Pelotudo_ - DarkKing ok take it honestly I'm not going to pass any more tests on that topic of the girl with cancer but we were threatened with that

all this was taken from a discord MD - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-08-27/1661563936-281417-image.png

What happened, you screwed up, so far nobody sent me a DM saying something, it seems that you are 11 years old. Besides, you and your friend asked me for my IP to fuck it (I passed it on because they're some kids who use stressers) and they haven't even thrown it at me yet, they did the cool and everything and they're both full kuakers, I asked you what it was a ddos ​​and you blocked me. You also sent me an IP (which wasn't yours) and you told me that I doxed you (he who doesn't know, with an IP you can't dox a person, since the IP gives you the generic location information, where the post is ; then there you show that you are a kuaker saying that with an ip you can dox, the real clown). Besides, it shows that you are more kuaker when you say that you are going to throw away the wifi, when in reality the "wifi" is the internet signal, that is, the wifi is not stupid, what is thrown away is the service through a packet attack , that to do it a vps is used (something that you probably don't even know what it is). Well I don't know what else you want me to say and keep humiliating you, I forgot something... HAHAHAHA...

What makes you look more kuaker than all of the above (that you were re-seen as a kuaker), is that you told me this:
Asshole#5718: send a picture of a "Nmap" shortcut
Asshole#5718 says: if I don't know how to dose anything
Asshole#5718 says: tell me what that is
Asshole#5718 says: bitch

Here I leave a screenshot of the chat: 

Here we see a clear example of kuaker, you may wonder why? Well this is because "Nmap" is a program that scans a network for low security or open ports, so that it can do something about those bad ports. If you did not know, it is a program that is mainly found in the Linux distribution, called "Kali Linux", this distribution is mostly used by people who study Computer Security or people who learn ethical hacking. Well you are not any of those, you are a Spanish who flashes and is just a kuaker.

Jellz - HAHAHA HACKER KIDS 
for god sake close this is embarrassing the creator of this thread alone hahahah
DarkKing - Shine The idiot thinks nmap is for doxing jajjajaja

nmap is only for scanning ports lmao
DarkKing - Jellz It is a kid apparently, who thinks he is a "hacker" for watching videos on youtube apart the nmap is only for scanning ports not for doxing and does not know what it is for ....

he doesn't dare to show his face he sends his staff to throw shit somewhere else because he can't do it by himself XD - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-08-27/1661573714-82392-fl90ouqxiaeacbc.jpg
DarkKing - nmap is only useful for scanning ports of video game servers or nodes etc. but not for doxing clown. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-08-27/1661573873-414997-imagen-2022-08-27-001718584.png
Alex_Milan - DarkKing no ive already known sharkhost scammed but this is a thread about starnode not sharkhost u fucking idiot
HotCode - Alex_Milan This thread has been made by a SharkHost fan to StarNode lmao
Jellz - Alex_Milan actually from what you can easily understand this and another thread were made out of revenge to starnode denouncing sharkhost and their complaint really brought down their machines (which means they really use free evidence) instead starnode is still standing, suspicious isnt it? thats why I say its a kids fight, they only make threads for fight not to denounce
Pelotudo_ - Shine First of all do you have any proof of all this? you only insult and talk a lot if you don't remember I have all the fucking MD of disord all you did is come and insult nothing else we were peacefully asking vainki questions until we asked him to solve everything peacefully as you can see in the chat screenshots




later he added you the only thing you did was insult us all I deleted you twice because the first time vainki didn't tell us who he was then he said a "friend" we left him you joined and started insulting and in addition there were 2 MD 1 was lost - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-08-27/1661621815-226919-image.png

Shine - Pelotudo_ 
It will be the last time that I answer a thread because it is childish to talk like that and not talk for a call instead of publishing it. Look, they are uploading what suits you, because as soon as I entered the DM group, you told me to put ipconfig in cmd and pass it on to you, I did it because I'm not afraid of you, you told me you were going to throw away my wifi, when the wifi is not thrown in case you didn't know, then since you didn't throw it at me there I insulted you. the truth that you were like a pete when saying that with an ip it is doxed and that with nmap too. Besides, they took us out of the groups, which you upload what will suit you, when you started. But hey, the truth is that it's for kids to follow this discussion, that's why I invite you to have a debate so we can see who the lammer/kuaker is. Whenever you want you can send me a message to my dm and we record it and upload it. There if we are going to see who the kids are, because I told you we are going to call and you didn't want to. Nothing more to say, I await your message...
Shine - Jellz
I never played the hacker, I just went to respond in defense of starnode, because they are my friends and I defend them. I never talk about something I don't know, because otherwise it would be a lick and I don't plan to be. The truth is that this entire thread, the creator would have to delete it because it was very badly stopped.

 yo nunca me hice el hacker, nomas fui a responder en defensa de starnode, porque son mis amigos y los defiendo. Nunca hablo de algo que no se, porque sino seria un lamer y no lo pienso ser. La verdad que este hilo completo, el creador lo tendría que eliminar porque quedo muy mal parado.
Pelotudo_ - Shine first you started to insult and we were not going to remain silent after 4 insults you said "and you don't even know the streets where you live
" then we answered you "ipconfig
and everything it says happens" and you passed your ip and you yourself said "throw me the net"


We never said that we were going to drop your Wi-Fi or dox you, we just told you to pass ipconfig and nothing else and now you are lying that we threatened to drop your Wi-Fi - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-08-27/1661624344-341714-image.png
Pelotudo_ - Shine that is very bad standing? Honestly, I'm tired of you, you're just threatening and insulting life, and you shouldn't be on this topic because you have nothing to do with it, the topic is with the CEO of starnode and me, but the CEO, all fagots, just makes you start insulting and the other remains silent laughing
GeoHasCameBack - Pelotudo_ no one cares tbh
Shine - Pelotudo_ JAJAJAJ como te salvas de que no este en ese grupo de md así mandamos la captura entera sin que edites mensajes o borres algo, cuando me la pediste te la pase y luego de eso me dijiste quieres que te tiremos el wifi, a lo que respondí a que me lo tires el internet y no lo hiciste. Nada mas que decir, quedaste humillado con mi primer hilo, mejor retírate del mundo de los lammers/kuakers así no quedas peor.

HAHAHAHA how do you save yourself from not being in that DM group so we send the entire screenshot without you editing messages or deleting anything, when you asked me I sent it to you and after that you told me you want us to throw away the wifi, to which I replied for you to throw the internet at me and you didn't. Nothing more to say, you were humiliated with my first thread, better withdraw from the world of lammers / kuakers so you don't look worse.
Jellz - Pelotudo_ actually if you can talk, for something you created this thread as a stupid and also you looked stupid with your posts now you put up with it ha

if it was a problem between you and the other ceo I would talk privately, but here we are a place where we can all talk publicly
Shine - Pelotudo_ ya te dije en otro hilo, me metí porque soy amigo del dueño y soy fiel a starnode, por eso los defendí. Si no sabes no hables
Shine - Jellz Exactly, besides it was not between him and the owner, but he also brought a friend, that's why being 2 the CEO spoke to me


exacto, aparte no era entre el y el dueño, sino que el metió también a un amigo, por eso al ser 2 me hablo a mi el CEO
Pelotudo_ - Shine if you want I add you to the MD and you see it
vainki - Pelotudo_ The issue is not between you and me, it's between me and sharkhost, you're just a random who came to threaten me with his girlfriend on discord.
Pelotudo_ - Shine I'm not going to look stupid, I'm just telling you something that you and your little friend, the ceo, get ready because I'm getting in touch with Oracle. Do not take this as a threat as you take everything. they turned off the servers for something and there are more than 40 discord users infiltrated in their starnode discord and more than 10 people behind this I am just a voice that speaks because the others control it.
Pelotudo_ - I will not speak again in this thread
vainki - Pelotudo_ I knew you were such a liar as to say I shut down the servers out of fear, I shut down the servers because I rebooted the machines because I increased the storage and the servers are all on now.
Shine - Pelotudo_ dale add me to the md, my tag: Don't#5523
Shine - Pelotudo_ 
HAHAHAHA what do you say clown, every time you bury yourself worse, you are a fucking lammer and you will always remain the same. Oracle is not going to happen to you, not even half a ball, we do not take anything as a threat, the last thing I am going to be afraid of is an 11-year-old boy who says he is going to talk to Oracle and says that with Nmap he doxea, You're a fucking kuaker and you won't change anymore. Little kisses love, I await your answer for the debate

JAJAJAJA que dices payaso, cada vez te entierras peor, eres un jodido lammer y siempre vas a seguir siendo el mismo. Oracle no te va a pasar ni media bola, no tomamos nada como una amenaza, lo ultimo que le voy a tener miedo es a un niño de 11 años que dice que va a hablar con Oracle y dice que con Nmap doxea, Eres un puto kuaker y no vas a cambiar más. Besitos amor, espero tu respuesta para el debate
DarkKing - It's funny to keep reading this post, the one who opened the thread was humiliated and even more humiliated.

He is so angry because a friend filed a complaint with IONOS about the scam that sharkhost was running that IONOS shut down all of sharkhost's nodes.

and now they only dedicate to cry and threaten without having arguments even invent that starnode uses oracle free trial? but they do not know how to prove it to such an extent that they look like idiots

especially this one who opened the thread believing himself as a hacker with a nmap that is only for scanning ports lmao

well, I will stop commenting on this drama of a depressed child who can't do anything by himself, better close this thread the fuck you have given him no one will get it out. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-08-27/1661644073-663320-wlop-31se.jpg

GeoHasCameBack - hi james
DarkKing - Win It's funny to see a new alt commenting nonsense that you come from sharkhost? it's the typical thing they're so burned because they've been deleted because of the scam hahahaha LMAO
DarkKing - Win Besides you don't even know the difference between Hentai and anime haha typical of a kid trying to defend a hosting deleted for scamming hahaha
DarkKing - Win
Hey kid hurt because your hosting has been deleted for scam, you don't know the difference between "wallpaper art / anime art" and hentai.

You have only come to comment nonsense because you don't even know where you stand, this image is not a hentai and you don't know the difference.

That's why SharkHost is dead zzzz scamming people and lying zzzz - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-08-31/1661909833-548111-imagen-2022-08-30-213635823.png
