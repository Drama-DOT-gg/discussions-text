TheAlex - Well, it comes to pretty much no surprise at all at this point
Plexed did a huge oopsie. So big in fact i can argue that @Oliver1234dotdot and @Shershah and teh peopel defending him need to just shut up lmfao. 
Ok so first off, the invoices channels got promptly removed. HMMMM i wonder why.

PLEXED HAS BEEN ABUSING HETZNER RIGHT UNDER OUR NOSES


not my screens but still do the job. Enter mike, he is the big boy of the gang, he knows everything about plexed. He took badsk's account. He will lose his host... Again


Now fun fact. Badsk removed his invoices cannels, i am pretty sure he paid for a couple nodes, then when people started believing him he went right back to scamming clueless kids 


Also yeah, uh, everything is down, Plexed got spanked pretty hard on this one 

HONORABLE MENTIONS







Also to all the people working with him, why? Like i get working with him in one of his hosts but you guys know what he is like and you know hw is scamming people. If you work with the scammer, you are the scammer


Also the staff denies earning money, so plexed pretty much earns about 300 bucks a week and doesnt pay anything to anyone. So good job plexed i guess


Also Halex doxx let's go 

Blow up their phones or something idc


Note to all of d.gg
If Plexed says he paid for something, he is probably lying

Chirag - TheAlex Also the staff denies earning money, so plexed pretty much earns about 300 bucks a week and doesnt pay anything to anyone. So good job plexed i guess

oh hell nah, google adsense payouts were to Mike's bank account, so mike has all the money
Chirag - TheAlex Halex doxx let's go

I'll tell you what, I can confirm those are real details lmaoo
Austin - He seems like a nice person he owns a dashboard thingy that he was nice enough to showcase, someone called him a scammer but Plexed defended by saying that he owns a host named HelixNodes or something like that, which has been completely fine for 2 months now.

So I don't know who is right and who is wrong.
Two - he actually pays for them now. (i think)
this is old news. he's not THAT hated anymore.
Chirag - Two no, mike sent me a ss of an 11 day old unpaid invoice of 266 euros
Plexed - Chirag I explained why
Loser - Hm.
SpoonyTG - TheAlex man how tf can hetzer be abused? tf
SirCat - SpoonyTG defuq u talking about u can abuse hetzner with barely any knowldege how to, its ez to abuse hetzner thats also why so many DO abuse it.
TheAlex - Plexed 
explain it here
for everyone to laugh at you
TheAlex - Austin 
He is a scammer, fuck him
TheAlex - SpoonyTG lolwut?
You can abuse hetzner without any knowledge of how hetzner works at all
colaaaa - discord?
SpoonyTG - TheAlex No I mean how is it abusable, since hetzner has no free plan or anything for it to be abused
TheAlex - SpoonyTG carding
SpoonyTG - TheAlex so like when they pay for a dedicated server they just use random cards with insufficient funds bruh that's sad since they make a lot of money out of these hosts, especially the paid hosts badsk started
Two - Chirag lmaoo
