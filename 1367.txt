SpoonyTG - It's so sad how these idiots still run a network after raiding 2 discord servers. and giving people ranks on their servers and blackmailing people smh + they use a cracked Potpvp plugin and decompiled it and weren't able to recompile 🤣 , Even the other old owner was exposed on black spigot (Schaefer) https://blackspigot.com/downloads/downfall-of-schaefer-part-1-premades.20233/ + the still continue to use cracked plugins on pebblehost
 






The Funny Thing is was a previous owner, got removed for bullshit, random reason. by another owner by the name of crent also a moderator @ColdPVP And a Media Rank, the only reason he was added as an owner was that he claimed to get famous people into the server which is bullshit and was not what I wanted to do but the main owner wanted him to be an owner, after ragging on a children's game decided to delete the server files, blame it on me then get rid of my roles (Had Ownership at the time on discord) and added the owner of galactic nodes as a dev. 

Who is Racist, Ableist, Skateboarding's the Owner of also Raided Doxa Network One Of My Servers, Recently Attempted to raid us thru the panel thru a corrupt dev opping himself ingame, after we ban him unbanning himself thru console 

I kept banning him and proof of that is his UUID and his IP that I censored out but I do not have any more screenshots of him attempting to raid

If anyone doesn't believe anything in this post I can prove it very easily just contact me on discord.

Aaron_ - Please report to discord about these matters and not create threads on drama.gg about these.
Endy - Hey, as an owner of this server I would like to say. DTRNameTags is a freind of a formal owner who we branched away from because he said some really, really bad things. He also tried to ddos us. They go by the name of crent. Schaefer, the old owner, was exposed by Xylo for scamming. I, endy, would like to say I am no way affiliated with these raiding actions. Schaefer was the one involved with cracked plugins and I am currently buying a Strike Practice licence with financial help (im broke).  All im trying to do is have a fun place where people can chill man not a business operation. I admit, I am not your average server owner and really don't have time to deal with this stuff, yes I am currently in class. I will most likely give the server to someone who knows what their doing if this continues to happen.
Endy - As with Spoony, he kept pressuring him to give him Owner and it made me extremely uncomfortable.
Endy - SpoonyTG I also do have to agree that Skateboarding has done some very corrupt things.
Endy - I did what was right for my mental health, smooth is done with.
SpoonyTG - Endy I never did, I was always a owner, got removed for no reason
SpoonyTG - Aaron_ this is not a report this is just to expose these people. to avoid people getting scammed or raided
Jen - Endy yk if u can't handle a host don't start one at all
Stop making excuses
Jen - Your host was already in the shit
SpoonyTG - Jen DTR is the main Person who owns it and Also is a dev at  @astralmc a known server which is embarrassing tbh
Jen - SpoonyTG anyways. Just shut down the shit host
SpoonyTG - Endy I got a question if he was corrupt why would you keep him as an owner your making excuses to get out of it.
Endy - SpoonyTG I felt like Skateboardings would attack me if i did. Anyways I recognize, I have been manipulated countless times throughout the process of this server. By Schaefer, Crent, and possibly you. And do to this stress and not having a world of time, I shut down this server. I am only planning on reviving it if I have a really, really, trustable partner. Smooth is a thing of the past, you may close this thread. Skateboardings will not continue to assist me in this journey in the future. I would also like to say you wernt "always" owner, you were given it for 5 minutes. Smooth is gone so theres no purpose in continuing.
Endy - Jen My main goal was to make a place for my freinds, not really professional. But other people tried to turn it in a place just for that. Going forward I will whitelist my servers.
SpoonyTG - Endy 5 minutes was recently, if your gonna whitelist your servers make them local host/for friends only and keep it private forever.
Endy - SpoonyTG Yeah, if im going to attempt to create another server I would probably need to partner with a place with an already good staff team. Anyways, were good now, Skateboardings is not part of the equation.
SpoonyTG - Endy It's actually nice that your active, responding quickly
