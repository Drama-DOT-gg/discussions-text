Didaka - Hello, @Aces

Our VAT number is BG206334868.
As I can see on your provided image there are 2 BG please remove the second BG and try again.
I'm leaving a link here.

You should write 206334868, not BG206334868.

Best Regards,

There's nothing wrong with this company as far as I can tell, it doesn't seem like you understand what "false advertising" means. You clearly did no research into this company itself. Please don't create posts with insufficient evidence.

Sincerely,
Vanquish
Vanquish - Aces Please refer to this post and formally leave winterhoax like promised.
