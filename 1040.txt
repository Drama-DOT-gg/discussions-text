I've been watching or spying QloxHost for the past 2 weeks, maybe I should continue doing research about the singapore nodes. Shall we? Alright below this message there will be tons of freaking proof and bullshit about this chilidish owner

#1 - Massively pinging everyone for hating on Spade.



Even the staff trying to stop making offers.

#2 - Lets see if its really 32 Cores  "Bare Metal Cloud" from Google LLC

#3 - Imagine asking help in announcement like really bruh, you owned a host and can't even fix a single problem.

#4 - Yeah, no one is worrying about you bitch.

#5 - "Better than lagnodes." Meanwhile the pig fat pfp kid who is resetting the nodes for no absolutely reason. 


Node Specification, News, and etc .. is coming to this thread soon! - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-10-11/1633929155-894425-image.png

Thominek - that kiddo is also homophobic lol
Ptero - Kowone what
Plexed - Jacob So the reason porn and hentai ads are there are cause it gives more money than normal ones

Ptero - Aarony "omg the owner litwerwalwly sucks" man shut ur sassy ass girl mouth up
Sebasorova - Plexed instead of replying to that, reply to the data leak things
tan_playz - Plexed you good? 70% of free host users are literally 12-14 year olds and you introducing nsfw ads is literally encouraging kids to watch porn
Aaron_ - tan_playz Lets not forget 60% of the users on pornhub are under 18
Knockoff - Hello everyone.

To begin with, yes, he used NSFW, which is inappropriate for teenagers. He should have mentioned that it contained 18+ advertisements, but it was too late. But what is the point of hating him?Use his host at your own risk.

Also, There are some host that started it, so idc  i just wanted to express my thoughts.
Knockoff - Also They are Not Scared Of Anyone Of You Ofc 
Why They Will 🙂
Shershah - There staffs try to raid lush discord server but at least qlox have time to clear this matter and live in peace.

Ibrahim - Jacob I swear this photo itself is iconic
Shiftly - QloxHost is a scam. The owner uses Google Cloud free trials for the servers and even the server staff hate QloxHost. If you want to make a server that will be automatically deleted every 2 days, use QloxHost. DO NOT USE QLOXHOST IT IS A SCAM.
