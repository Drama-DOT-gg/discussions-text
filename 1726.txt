MattC - So the owner of LocalNodes grabbed my ip (i alr changed), he thinks that he is super cool that he got an ip adress and when i asked him if he logs ips, he told me "no" but then showed me a screenshot with my country https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/915383896886104136/944884062579986452/unknown.png

(he says that his bot told him abt that activity)
Another reason to not use LocalNodes
DevXo - Kid, listen up...

ControlPanel.gg contains a IP Logger already. It is, to prevent people, from making alts. No, its not in the files. If you click on the user, you can clearly see their country, mail and IP. What can i do with the ip? Nohting really. I dont give a fuck about your ip. I knew at the start, it was you. So go live your life kid. I know you are a lil sad, beacouse you cannot even afford Nodes, for your own host.
MattC - DevXo Well i dont have a host so stop talking shit and yes i am very sad that a 13yo old kid that asked me how to reboot the vps got my ip (alr changed)
DevXo - MattC Listen up, that time, i didnt know shit about Ubuntu. Now that i've learned, i know much more. Even a guy from Pterodactyl said, you dont know shit. He understood it in the first place.
DevXo - MattC You mean, you have a dynamic ip ü§£ imagine.
MattC - DevXo At least i dont buy 4$ vps from contabo and overallocate it to 64gb ram or more and i dont give ppl free rewards just for giving me a vps that is prob shit and unsecure asf and i will never do that. also it has been over 1 month with ur "estonian node" and i cant see it
MattC - DevXo if thats so, why u asked me how to reboot the vps lmfao
DevXo - MattC Not anymore. I just bought 2 new nodes yesterday, and today i will be launching a new one from my friend üòõ
MattC - DevXo 4$ contabo nodes overallocated nice
MattC - DevXo i can make alts and use pterovm to see what nodes u r using
MattC - DevXo also, this u? - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-02-20/1645349909-92356-image.png
DevXo - MattC Using alts? Against discord TOS. Also, ill block romania, since i can do it. Well, use VPN. Go be more exposed to ptero community kid.
MattC - DevXo alts for what retard, i use alts for ur fucking host not discord XD
MattC - DevXo sure idc abt ur vpn, and i never saw anything in the ptero community saying something abt a vpn
DevXo - MattC Youre just making yourself more shit out of this.
MattC - DevXo i think u r doing that. u r just getting exposed
MattC - DevXo dont forget that i can use pterovm to see ur node specs
DevXo - MattC No? If i was exposed, i wouldnt have 800 people, and over 2K registered. They dont care about your act... Even the old oracle thing, they said its fine ü§£
DevXo - MattC Dont froget, that ill ban you
MattC - DevXo bcuz they simp for your free host
lmfao
MattC - DevXo i dont wanna join ur discord and i didnt mention anything abt ur discord server
DevXo - MattC oracle was paid.
MattC - DevXo how do u have 800 ppl and 2k registered, seems like half of the discord memebers are offline, bcuz last time i check, only 134 active out of 800 or 700
MattC - DevXo u told me that u had 2 credit cards and that u gonna use that to get free nodes from oracle
MattC - I sugges you stopping trying to "expose" me or "outsmart" me bcuz u alr got exposed to many ppl and ur arguments dont have any sense bcuz i have the dms with u
MattC - MattC suggest*
DevXo - MattC Lets be honest...

You just cant leave me alone, becaouse you want to take over the host. You want to be better than me, and you have nohting else to do. Well, if your toughts are so, go think more bout it.
MattC - DevXo i dont even wanna be involved with ur ass host. i alr told most of the ppl who were staff there to leave and stop trying to act smart,  bcuz u cant. Also why would i take over ur host when i am banned LMFAO
Milan1000 - DevXo shut up, when he said u logged ips u literally said no like defuq
Milan1000 - DevXo using discord alts isnt against discords tos it only is if one of his accs got banned
MattC - Milan1000 Thanks Milan!
MattC - Milan1000 also, i dont use alts to join his discord server bcuz its a waste of time, i only use alts made for controlpanel.gg aka his dashboard to check what nodes he has and how overallocated they are
DevXo - Milan1000 Stop pretending to protect him. I do not give a fuck. ControlPanel.gg has already inbuilt ip logger.
DevXo - MattC Why the fuck do you care about my host man? You litteraly care about it more than i do.
MattC - DevXo Why would he protect me, he prob barely knows me
Milan1000 - DevXo are u just a fuckign retard, u literally fucking said no when he said U logged ips, it shouldve been a fucking yes cuz controlpanel and evne fucking webservers log fucking ips u dumbass bitch
MattC - DevXo As i said, i dont give a fuck abt ur host. i am just exposing so ppl dont get their info stollen or prob sold
DevXo - Milan1000 I MYSELF do not log ips. CONTROLPANEL just gives them out, for admins. If youre admin on dashboard, you can clearly see ACCOUNTS IP'S.
DevXo - MattC Sold? My host is under HTTPS.
MattC - DevXo So why did u message me with a screenshot of my county, saying "good try kid"
MattC - DevXo k so?
DevXo - MattC Since i saw you doing it, and saw you still caring about my host ü§£
MattC - DevXo remember when u told me in the staff chat to set ssl, also, u paid someone to install pterodactyl panel for you XD
MattC - DevXo Yes, i care a lot abt ur host üôÅ
DevXo - MattC No? I have not paid anyone to  install my ptero for me. Its so easy to install pterodactyl lmaooooooooooooooooooooooo
MattC - DevXo bro u told me that stfu XD
DevXo - MattC Exactly. Go maker your own host. If you want, ill just give you a fucking free vps to get started with. Just leave my host alone
MattC - DevXo u also told me to help set up ur wings
DevXo - MattC No.
MattC - DevXo "go maker" ü•∂
DevXo - MattC Autocorrect.
MattC - DevXo I'd rather buy my own vps, instead of using a vps from a scammer, which, if i do use it, my data will get stolen
DevXo - MattC Data? What the acctual fuck. Get an ssl onto it.
MattC - DevXo r u actually telling me this? The one who didnt have ssl for 1 month and was storing emails and passwords un-hashed
DevXo - MattC I NEVER WERE STORING FUCKING PASSWORDS AND EMAILS. WHY THE FUCK SHOULD I NEED THEM FOR?
MattC - DevXo to sell them?, also, as u gave me ssh, i checked that but decided to let it there
DevXo - MattC I've never fucking sold any kind of information. I even dont know how to do it.
MattC - DevXo never said that u sold it. i said that u could sell it
MattC - DevXo how dont u know how to sell something? lol
DevXo - MattC How to steal information from databases.
MattC - DevXo where tf did i mention databases.
MattC - DevXo u can just find the file location where passwords and emails are located
J0SH - MattC I think he means he doesn't know where to sell it.
MattC - Prob

J0SH
DevXo - J0SH No, i do not know, how to even steal data.
MattC - DevXo Josh, devxo is kidding, u can just find the location where passwords and emails are stored and then sell it or give it
DevXo - MattC Im not. Indeed, you can come over, and check everything.
MattC - DevXo give me ur location and ill come üòÉ
DevXo - MattC Estonia, Tartu, Riia Maante 12b, condo 6
MattC - DevXo i hope thats not ur actual location
__SECRET__ - Bro tf y'all fucking 9 year's old fighting here mf
MattC - __SECRET__ nah mate, he is just getting exposed for what he is doing and bcuz he did bad things, this is what happens
DevXo - MattC Oh... So i see you want to make a exploit for localnodes and steal all the data. Following proof is in following images: - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-02-20/1645382749-53330-screenshot-20220220-204152.png
