Deleted User - Do someone has invite links to their discord? Want to mess around with them a little bit.
Korudo - Hehehe give me their id ima go tell them to shut their ass up before someone does something, probably will try to ddos winterhoax lol

Ani - I talked to one of the owners a few days ago. His name is CustomConfig. They said they don’t have a website or a trust pilot yet. At that time, he said he started the host 4 hours ago. Yesterday I asked if I can port scan their servers and they said yes. I also notice that they limit their VPS options to only Ubuntu, CentOS, and Windows. Both owners are quite unprofessional, not just the one in the pictures above.

wow look at that its a highly unprofessional status
Iceey - I don't get why you of all communities think professionalism is a standard, look in the fucking mirror lmao.
Ani - Got kid to leak their IP, and the owners are constantly cursing racist words and messing with people. Iceey Does this fall under unprofessional yet? - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-09-22/1600760572-443774-08161eac-91dd-47d6-a8b2-de90a06a2069.jpeg

Jedrik - Ani That would've been a good reply unless you actually read what Iceey said
Jedrik - So we gon' like add a confirmed tag on this or wha
Iceey - Ani I recommend duolingo for your studies on basic English.
CustomConfig - None of this is true, I will fix my staff team and its not my issue people are leaking ips.
andrexisretarded - what the fuck they can create their own TLD wtf - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-09-22/1600785254-900818-image.png
Jen - Lmao, They dot even own their own Domain
They are the saddest shit ever
eraters - yeah they cant afford it
Deleted User - andrexisretarded They're just a bunch rando of weirdo's who thought that they can create their own TLD. LMFAOOO
Deleted User - Best joke out of 341 jokes I've heard LMFAO - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-09-22/1600786674-305207-screenshot-2020-09-22-22-57-26-37.png
andrexisretarded - StarLightz what the shit
Deleted User - andrexisretarded nah, I mean, it's painful laughing at thing that I can't stop laughing after that. He's selling a domain with a custom TLD for just $8 when the TLD registration is like $185k lmao. I can't stop laughing welp
Deleted User - What does he actually mean by "A free hosting company". But, can I ask a question? Do they're actually registered? - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-09-22/1600787905-436883-screenshot-2020-09-22-23-10-14-32.png
Soyabn9 - trial not free.
andrexisretarded - StarLightz i shit

StarLightz what the shit
andrexisretarded - Soyabn9 .

Soyabn9 trial not free.

false advertising then ez pez
Iceey - StarLightz Do you actually English?

Just kidding, I haven't seen proof that they're registered, nothing wrong with that tho unless they falsely claim to be.
CustomConfig - Hi everyone, yes I agree with me not dealing with some issues I go to college. I’m also not 12 and the company isn’t registered yet and I wont falsely claim that, we also get our domains through a good domain service which can cost up to 60$ but its worth it, We are also fixing the staff team as they aren’t the best. We have good services but bad reputation due to some people. Ie the other owner he is 16 but sometimes he can act like a 14 year old, I am currently 17, turning 18 soon so please watch what you say. This server isn’t a scam nore do we mean to set a bad reputation of the company. Sorry for the issues we have caused - CEO of EliteHosting. Thanks for reading have a good day. If you have anything else to say please state it, also forgot to mention we have only been a thing for 3 days. Can you clam it down a bit.... You won’t do any better.
Jedrik - CustomConfig also forgot to mention we have only been a thing for 3 days

This has been a recurring occurrence, no matter how young your host is, you show unprofessionalism or signs of just being shit overall, it's all going south from there, there's no excuse.
CustomConfig - Jedrik I bet you if you join back it will be professional.
Jedrik - CustomConfig

You've also denied everything, yet apologized for it

Might I add, anything within your "company" is under your responsibility.
Jedrik - CustomConfig Send me an invite.
CustomConfig - Jedrik discord.gg/elitehosting
Jedrik - CustomConfig Well duh not here but anyway.
Jedrik - Really random, but I'll plug this here so CustomConfig can still see this since he's offline rn

So I was wondering why the hell they had so many no pfp users in their welcomes channel joining idk if they got raided or anything there was nothing about it in the announcements channel and the discussion channel had recently gotten cleared so idk, anyway I decided to look into how many no pfp and random username users joined today (23/09/2020) and holy jesus.... - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-09-23/1600837399-59278-image.png

CustomConfig - We got bottled, and we are banning them.
andrexisretarded - CustomConfig yes you were bottled
Soyabn9 - Guys, you have to clam it down a bit.
HCS - Send me a link to their site please.
eraters - That's the thing mate. They don't have one.
RektorDK - This guy AKA CEO is chargebacking much too.. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-09-26/1601138094-317418-cd7f7bd82a5792bb01d3cee85504c4d1.png

TFSxADVITH - Such a sad kid lmfao
Ani - They started back up
Withdrawal - They started again, EliteHosting. The two ceos are をまDrqgonsまを
#0001 and CustomConfig
#5878. As I know, why would you run a host if you don't even know how to install the pterodactyl panel, setup eggs etc. One of their ceos were constantly dming me about an issue with their test server on their brand new panel that I've installed because they asked me to. 
One of the ceos doesn't even know how to create servers on the pterodactyl panel. I believe that をまDrqgonsまを is under 13, the error is in the message it self. They should learn more about the pterodactyl panel before starting a host with it. Also, one of their ceo is constantly spamming me with pings about to add allocations. Just go learn to use the pterodactyl panel first. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-09-30/1601476520-643797-screenshot.jpeg
Withdrawal - Also just come up with your own invite rewards. Don't steal it from other hosts.

The original invite rewards from an another host:
Then they stole them and put them in their own host:
They just changed the emojis.. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-09-30/1601477508-515598-proof-1.png

Enmatt - Bxrk There are literally screenshots there lmfao..
Two - StarLightz I was literally about to say something like this when reading this.
Two - Bxrk You literally just asked for "proof" on the proof. Just saying, the invite rewards you copied are from CentroNodes. Don't steal.
Deleted User - Two they're technically rich
Bxrk - Two I copied CentroNodes? Hmmm I don't know about that one. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-02-01/1612193342-260705-sa.png
Bxrk - Two I did not steal ^
Vanquish - Bxrk reporting you to the discord CEO as we speak.
Bxrk - Vanquish reason
Vanquish - Bxrk better discord police get on the ground - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-02-01/1612193834-461113-image.png
Bxrk - Vanquish Theme not plugin
Jedrik - BetterDiscord in itself isn't fully bannable, having plugins such as MessageLogger (which you, Vanquish, do have) is.
Vanquish - Jedrik fair enough
Jedrik - If you took a second to actually research about it, you'd find an email from a Discord staff member saying it's not fully bannable with just themes. Anyway, have a nice day.
Bxrk - Jedrik exposed #@Vanquish
Vanquish - Jedrik understandable have a nice day
Vanquish - Bxrk not exactly exposing if there's no proof/evidence of the use of modified better-discord plugins such as a MessageLogger that clearly depict my user account.
Vanquish - discord link though?
Bxrk - Vanquish 
Contacting the discord CEO now - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-02-01/1612194239-341041-dumbass.png
Jedrik - Vanquish Do you want me to?
Vanquish - Jedrik yes
Bxrk - Vanquish 
Contacting the discord CEO now - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-02-01/1612194316-155636-yes.png

Bxrk - Saqib That was in my friends old hosting company discord server, I asked to use their hosting plans and she/he agreed
Bxrk - Jedrik what about it
Saqib - Bxrk According to two you copied something from my host.
Bxrk - Saqib Nice
