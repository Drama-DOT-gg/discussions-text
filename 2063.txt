Koisip - Originally, I wasn't planning on making a post regarding "SnowyNodes" because I thought they were going die the next month for honestly being the shit they are. But as of recent conversations and experience's from users, it appears that their hosting company is doing unethical acts. 

Advertising on Other People's Host
Context: Apparently the owner of SnowyNodes, brycecarpenter#2962, decided it would be a clever idea to advertise his own hosting server onto other hosting service's discords. 



The owner, "henryy" attempted to confront Bryce for why he was advertising on his server. Bryce did not seem to show any hint of respect and decided to insist that "this was funny." 


Copying NameCheap's ToS
What's interesting about their ToS is that in some places of the document, it contains the name of NameCheap. Ex. "Namecheap has the absolute right, in its sole discretion, to terminate its Services and close Your account."

After doing some background research, it appears that they copied it from Namecheap.

NameCheap's ToS: https://www.namecheap.com/legal/hosting/tos/

Ex.
NameCheap's First Two Lines of the ToS:
You agree that Namecheap may modify this Agreement and the Services it offers to You from time to time. You agree to be bound by any changes Namecheap may reasonably make to this Agreement when such changes are made.

The funny part about SnowyNode's ToS is the fact that they FORGOT to remove NameCheap's name in some areas of their ToS.

EmeraldMike - As well as helping gathering the correlations. A funny thing to note is the inconsistencies with their item descriptions. Where a free sever has 1GB ram and 1Vcore but their paid plans don't specify but hey free domain am I right.
Win - the selling fivem bit is just pointless, honestly i get its against fivem TOS but its like the only reason it exists is because Zap-Hosting, which is honestly awful.
Koisip - Win Honestly speaking, the funny part about their services is that it wouldn't even be able to match FiveM's minimum specs. 



The "free plan" is 1GB Memory and 10GB Space storage lmao - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-10-26/1666812844-55267-image.png
Koisip - Part 2 of this shitty saga. 

Censorship of Critics


They try to use TrustPilot's "false review" system to attempt to take down any posts that criticizes them. 

Owner Deleting His Own Messages + Being Unprofessional



The Owner deleted the following:
"Since it under my name
I'm changing the specs to 72GB
I'm also giving more core and more ram
Pricing beingchange
Make them better
Idgaf what callum has to say
Fuck you Callum 💓 but also love you"

Apparently the owner, instead of attempting to work things out, decided to play god with a gun on his forehead. 

Lying about the Nodes he bought
Apparently the owner claimed to have bought the following:


As of 10/23/2022, he sent a picture of his server node invoice:

These are not the same nodes. The node he is using is IONOS's VPS vCore XXL. 
The fact that the company attempted to hide this information really shows his insecurities. 

Attempting to Hide all the evidence

As a way to hide all the evidence and anything stupid Bryce might say, they ended up deleting and locking the main chat up. 

What we can learn from this?
Before you can fully put trust in a hosting company, make sure you do your research. Companies like these are full of insecurities and instead of spending time trying to fix those problems, they instead try to censor them. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-10-26/1666812352-215837-image.png

Koisip - Final Saga of Snowynodes.

As of 10/29/2022, brycethedev#2006 is officially no longer an "executive."







Long story short, a lot of things in this drama.gg post made against Snowynodes were true and a lot of the errors that was done by this company have been pointed at on Bryce for his unprofessionalism. 

As for Snowynodes, there is a possibility it will come back but offering better and less sketchy services with Bryce out of the picture (thank god.) - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-10-29/1667080851-907555-image.png

DCTM - Koisip Hey man! My name is callum and I was the official owner of snowynode which sadly shut down until further notice. The website theme was giving to me by a hosting Ive known for ages as they didn’t use it anymore and yes that’s my fault for not finishing the template due to school starting again. I understand the FIVEM TOS part but you see Allmost every big and small hosting company doing it am I wrong? I’m not trying to start a fuss as the company has shut down now. But I would just like to reply to this and fill you lot on some information. We don’t scam I could see the point we’re he was coming from about it as I didn’t finish things as I was the only one who kinda knew how to do it all and was basically on my own, Bryce was alright for a few days then he starting being rude to members in snowynode saying racist comments, being horrible, then it started happening to me saying I was gay, racist comment to me, telling me to hurry up with things when I wanted to take my time with putting stress on me, saying I didn’t know how to do my job and I was shit at it so I lost abit of confidence in hosting. I did give Bryce several warnings and members on snowynode did come to me about Bryce saying you will lose your company but I kept giving second chances which I shouldn’t have so it’s partly my fault. But by giving the second chances we lose reputation in our hosting. But Bryce will no longer be executive in any of my hostings in future. So I shut down snowynode because of that loss of reputation and the way he treated me as I didn’t have no more confidence left in me. But a few of my hosting mates saw how he treats the community and spoke to him you would have seen some of the screen shot further up about it which made me a little happy that some people had my back. I allways tried my best with the hosting but he dragged it down to the point we’re there is no more snowynode.

If you lot have any questions please reply and I will get back to you when I can thank you 🙂
