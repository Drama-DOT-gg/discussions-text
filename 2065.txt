Apeman3560 - Joined a discord server known as iron integration (https://dsc.gg/ironintegration) and turns out the owner isn't even 13, he uses free oracle and scams the members. He makes out that it's all legit and real until he takes about 2 weeks to deliver and still pending. Tbh don't bother joining he just wants members and some money to fund his little video game spree. If anyone reading this got scammed sorry I couldn't warn you earlier. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-10-29/1667066099-952944-screenshot-2022-10-29-185412.png

If he is using azure, then he can get into legal trouble with Azure as it's against their ToS to resell their products. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-10-29/1667073677-835628-image.png
