First off, it's a spanish host, so some things will be in spanish from the screens. I'll try to translate the best i can

https://hetrixtools.com/r/fc72eb8404ef916280d0bc23289e299f/ - Their uptime page. 


================00================

LYING ABOUT HARDWARE

How can they own ryzen 7 7000 if it's not coming out for another month? 


================00================

WEIRD PRICING SYSTEM (not necessarily something worth noting but just suspicious)

Also their pricing system is super weird

ok 0.5$ a gig


Why is is 0.8 now?


Why is it 1?


Why does the price increase the more RAM you buy?

================00================

NO BILLING SYSTEM


Translation: "All payments are made to paypal: lambrerolhaiserthiago@gmail.com
Any other person who says another email, even if they are CEO, they have to deposit to the gmail that I just told them.

We accept PayPal." 
So no WHMCS/Blesta 

UPDATE:

they sell through Tebex, thus losing 20% of all their income. 



This kinda proves my point, how can they profit anything? 

================00================

"DEDICATED" SERVERS




They literally resell dedicated server from OVH. No markup or anything, just blatant server resale. Classic skidders.

================00================
NO DOCUMENTS

Maybe i didnt see their website or i missed something but their ToS and Privacy Policy is nowhere to be found.
