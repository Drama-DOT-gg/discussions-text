FlyawayBear - jen how are you so kewl
Jen - FlyawayBear cause i'm supporting Kubbur &amp; big donator of Drama.gg
Plexed - uh that's back when no one knew who I was
Plexed - no shit i was broke then august was an absolute disaster
Preon - Plexed why were you offering to buy hostings if you couldnâ€™t afford itâ€¦â€¦â€¦
Ricardo - Plexed yeah but plexednodes.tk
Ricardo - Ricardo i think it was your best host
FlyawayBear - ok so, we come back to this in 2 months and see what happens mkmk
Preon - FlyawayBear that assumes we even remember by then; my attention span is awful on forums lmao
FlyawayBear - Preon i mean yea lol
Jen - Here is more damning evidence - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-01-07/1641561856-888956-sdrfgljdsrfgkljdfgkljfgdlkfdg.png

AceyGoBoom - Plexed yo plexed
AceyGoBoom - youve been kinda dead
Plexed - not rly im just never active here as i don't like d.gg
Jen - Plexed You don't want to feel guilty of the amount of data you have lost over the years
Dark - Jen GDPR should get his ass fined
SirCat-Qlox - Jen oh shit yeah all of those datalosses
Jen - SirCat-Qlox yup
FlyingMane - One day, Plexed, you will have to stand in front of the big daddy corporations like Google and Azure, and they will give you a check, for 40k. 40 thousand fucking dollars you stole from people. 40 thousand dollars you have put in your own pocket. You may not like drama.gg, but one day, you will have to answer for your actions. 
If i were you, i would have just quit hosting all together. You are lower than scum, you are none a filthy scammer, a person that swooper so low as to lose dozens if not hundreds of customers data. 
Your shitty ass, over allocated host will never repay for what you did. 

Live with it. I hope guilt eats you up from the inside
SirCat-Qlox - FlyingMane ðŸ˜³
Toki0179 - FlyingMane Hoes mad
Jen - Toki0179 Not mad. But he makes a great point, Badsk has lost 100s of dollars of people's data because he cannot afford to keep his host up. I recommend taking this as a warning from us your soul hearted drama.gg (self proclaimed) Investigators
Toki0179 - Jen Yeah I know, I was just saying "hoes mad" cause of how aggressive the person was I found it funny
Jen - Toki0179 You kind of have to. because badsk breaks the European law all the time
Toki0179 - Jen it's not like being aggressive is gonna stop him he probably isn't even reading these
IoNetty - i am shitting my pants; will people like this just disband there stuff
TheAlex - Toki0179 I wasn't mad

I was being realistic. Plexed stole 40 thousand of dollars from his customers. Untill he makes 200k not over allocating and repays his customers he is the lowest of scum
Ibrahim - FlyingMane these sorts of messages don't teach him
SpoonyTG - Jen This reply is off topic but this man is built diff using light mode
Jen - Those people who tried to stood up for him saying but he's changed like shut up bro, He can barely afford to keep ur data alive - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-01-14/1642200594-533737-image.png

Ples - Jen mike said he didnt even care about it, but when i told him 2 ppl reported him for it he got lowkey scared lol, even plexed dont care, they are begging for an adsense ban even though im warning them to stop
Halex - Oliver1234dotdot halex requires abt 800 euros to keep running
Ples - did u srsly just buy as many dedis as u can without making sure u actually get passive income and can actually pay that every month instead of spam warning others when ur about to pay and u dont have enough
Jen - Ples lol sure seems like it tbh
Ples - Jen he msot likely 99% just skipped the first invoice day then mass got dedis and hoped to god he would get enough to pay it next month
HaiNot_ - "dedis"
tovade - Jen i don't believe that he said that im a teenager, i don't own a host, im a 14 year old and how can you say "only 17 euros", i litterly get 15$ pocket money a month, at this point he is begging for money...
