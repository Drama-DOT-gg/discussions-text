Bxrk - Hello everyone in drama.gg
It has come to my attention that someone named "Enmatt" has Hoaxed us (created an account to hoax us lmao)
Anyways
I would like for the admins of Drama.gg to delete/archive the hoax about my host

Here is some things I have improved/fixed.


1  reply: We're now getting a new TOS/Privacy Policy. Hand wrote to our company. 

2 reply: doesn't really prove anything age related but when I first started hosting I needed a website for starter and someone offered me a website so he made him one (i forgot his discord as I forgot about it) 2 reply again: we ping @everyone to notify when a reset is going to occur we have had 0 data losses in the past.

reply: I pay for nodes with the money I saved up before my host was a thing. We get some money from the customers purchasing products from us.

reply: We fixed that, I was asking a simple question to the user if he can ping everyone. (we fixed all discord issues, everything is set up and ready)

reply: he offered us a logo so I accepted it. 


Pretty much the only valid thing in that thread is the TOS bit, although it was edited a tiny bit. (we're now getting a full valid tos for our company)

(ps: enmatt if something looks like a 12-year-old made it they're mostly not english...) - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-08/1620474639-635978-image.png

Bxrk - I can post the new TOS/Privacy Policy here once it is done.
Sloth - My god, just use Termly and get yourself some legals, they're valid and are written by people who know their stuff. As soon as the conversation is over, I'll archive the Thread.
Bxrk - we're no longer taking orders since our TOS is under rewrite.

Bxrk - Sloth Hey Sloth, how is it going? 
Thanks for taking notice of this thread. 
Not sure what you mean by ""As soon as the conversation is over, I'll archive the Thread." if you could explain that in further detail that would be great thanks.
Bxrk - Sloth My god, just use Termly and get yourself some legals, they're valid and are written by people who know their stuff.

Sure, that is a good idea. Not sure the Drama.gg community would like it tho ðŸ¤”
Tomas - Bxrk They are valid, is what matters.

I believe he means once you resolve the issues completely also
Bxrk - Tomas OK, I will resolve the issues, like I said all issues are resolved not including the TOS, Privacy Policy.. The message that Enmatt sent was edited (tos with me and sam) In the real thing I replied "All services are not currently online, we will release our TOS once the services are online" Bit scummy to edit that into that tho enmatt.... 

Tomas Tomas, I am getting a all legal documents ready.. Once I get it I will send it here. Hopefull you guys approve it and archive the thread.
