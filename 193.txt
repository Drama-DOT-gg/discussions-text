BabyAces - Okay I meet this kid in the winterhoax discord, and he asked me if I co locate, so I said yes because I do right. Than I said with the specs of one of my vpses. He doesn't fucking now what a vps is so here my proof. (Do not close this is just a discusion)

(The sad thing is he owns a host too.) - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-02-07/1612673236-42014-image.png
eraters - If you use vps's, you don't co-locate.
BabyAces - @eraters  I do for a few locations.... Like my house for example. He commited on my vps specs for my germany location.
eraters - He also stated, he's very tired and being tired could make you lose your train of thought quite easily. Failure to provide more evidence within 10 minutes will get this thread closed.
onyx - BabyAces Are you dumb? You can't colocate your own fucking house.
BabyAces - @eraters, this is a Discussion thread, and if you close it you will able to get demoted for it. I showed what I wanted to post there. Is that a issue for me posting my thinkings of a kid owning a fucking hosting company, and doesn't now what the fuck a vps is.... He should prob do some research before he starts his own company.
BabyAces - I put dedis in my house there, if that's better.
typicalGta - BabyAces That's called self hosting kiddo learn your facts, c'mon you kids these days have no respect like if I did that back in the day I'd get a slipper to the ass. Do you parents not teach you manners mate?
typicalGta - BabyAces oh and guess what? You just took much of the screenshot that makes you look good here's the full screenie
