ACE_NXT - Firstly I am not a host owner or any kind of developer!
But I need everyone to know about Hexitnodes
Hexitnodes started by bad#21298 
Basically it was a free Minecraft hosting company, It was not first time Bad starting the hosting company he had more than 6 before! All was Scam using Free trail vps,data Leaks ect...
But this time in Hexitnodes he payed for nodes(IDK weather it was bought or stealed)
Later on the host started growing faster than expected because it gave 3GB Ram and 125% CPU! When hexit hit 1k member's Bad reset the host completely announcing that "PANEL BROKEN ALL DATA NEED TO BE RESET RESOURCES WILL BE GIVEN BACK" In few minutes next announcement arrived "SORRY INVITE REWARDS AND J4J REWARDS CANNOT BE ADDED BECAUSE THERE IS AN ERROR"
Within 8 hours they completely reset host and started service again!
Everyone thought the problem was saved but next week
Announcement: SANBEAP DELETED STUFFS FROM PANEL CORRUPTED STUFFS SO WE NEED TO RESET!
Again people thought it was a mistake so everyone polled to reset thier server and resources!
Next week -
Announcement : SORRY I CANNOT MANAGE HEXITNODES WE WILL STOP OUR SERVICES 
We thought it was end of hexit but.....
Announcement: GUYZZ I CAN SAVE HEXITNODES BUT I WILL HAVE TO RESET RESOURCES AND SERVER
Poor customers accepted it lol including me! Because we just need a free mc server
Hexitnodes was again operational but next week
Announcement: SOMEONE FORMATED NGINX FOLDER SO EVERYTHING IS LOST I HAVE TO RESET EVERYTHING AGAIN
This was the time I really understood hexitnodes is scam
Again everything reset! 
Hexitnodes was again operational But Oliver and SANBEAP left ( Demoted)
Everything went for one week until 10th of July
At last Chirag send email to everyone about Hexitnodes THAT IT WAS A SCAM
But Badsk: 
Announcement: CHRAG STEALED YOUR DATA AND EMAIL SO IGNORE HIS EMAIL HE IS A SCAM
Around 60% of hexit user's was Indians aged around 11 - 15 
They won't understand what is happening what is data privacy itself!
What do you guys think 
What Badsk should deserve 
Some extra info: The data breach hasn't been reported to ICO !
Also, Chirag did not leak the database he just sent emails to everyone so that people stays safe 
Moral of the story:
