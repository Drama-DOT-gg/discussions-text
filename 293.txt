Toki0179 - Edit: Guys since this winterhoax has been made rednodes is dying and in attempt to hide their shady past eisk decided to make a new server host called PureNodes so please watch out for it. Unfortunately they banned me for literally no reason. Also the staff there are kinda trash they spent like 5 minutes trying to figure out how to mute me and then they gave up.

Just some proof that they are making a new host



This post is gonna be really short ngl but I just wanna show some stuff that happened in Redhost.

so Snip Nip#7777 decided it would be a good idea to use carding to purchase a node on redhost and i'm guessing you can see where this is going because it ended it up in data loss and they lost their node. They also had the unpaid invoice of almost 200$ - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-03-27/1616846976-991024-image.png

EmeraldMike - MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
_MrKnight_ - Toki0179 first of all we dint know he used illegal method until the node expired secondly we even dint launched we even had announced that we are still in beta so there will be some issues thirdly we changed name because there is a dedi provider in name of redhost so to solve fluctuate we rebranded it fourthly the dc migrated because the old dc got hacked we emailed all customers about new dc and stuff
_MrKnight_ - And lastly we will be using paid nodes when we launches ( note: we are still in beta )

LordDioski - _MrKnight_ Your english is killing me
Deleted User - hm
_MrKnight_ - LordDioski ty mate
_MrKnight_ - And fun fact my card is ok now I just need paypal to verify it and nah I ain't using gcp ( still saying we are in beta )
LordDioski - Beta doesnt even matter. 
You were going to use it so this host is a hoax
_MrKnight_ - And why cant I use gcp or azure for a beta host ( to fix bugs,add stuff and all and current users are happy with our beta itself)
_MrKnight_ - LordDioski is this leo?
_MrKnight_ - LordDioski nah I'm waiting for my new dedi
_MrKnight_ - Which I pays
LordDioski - _MrKnight_ Then why you provide servers on beta using very small vps with huge swal
LordDioski - _MrKnight_ nah. My old discord was Nuby badsk trend was going here and i changed
LordDioski - Can I see the full proof of payment
_MrKnight_ - LordDioski because....pls read general chat many people asked hosting and we only provided bothost and website host so we can solve the lagg issues
_MrKnight_ - LordDioski k wait
_MrKnight_ - This is our provider - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-03-23/1616460860-14055-screenshot-20210322-195337.png
_MrKnight_ - LordDioski hmm badsk....
_MrKnight_ - LordDioski do u want to see how much the "small beta node" laggs
_MrKnight_ - Already there is 15 servers ( web&amp;bot) - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-03-23/1616461013-65291-screenshot-20210322-195635.png
_MrKnight_ - Plus that node was ment only for ptero and client panel hosting then the members started to msg to launch the node so we did it because we dint had a choice
_MrKnight_ - And I'm going im having exam so if you have anything to ask in personal dm me I discord or msg here itself ( my id 
RedKn1ght‚Ñ¢#2006)
LordDioski - I NEED PAYMENT PROOF THAT YOU PAID
_MrKnight_ - LordDioski I clearly said ineed to get verified by paypal and the provider knows it so he said ok ( I can show proff)
_MrKnight_ - Bye exam time
NexusGamers - Toki0179 First thing first, we don't know it, but after a while and nodes expire, snip nip tell us the VPS is carding. We are all shocked if we know the VPS is illegal. We won't use it as carding is against every country's law + he didn't show the screenshot after the "it's called carding."
Thanks
~ Director Of RedNodes
LordDioski - Director lmao do u guys know whats position like everyone is director lmfso
europa - whys everyone using ionos lol
_MrKnight_ - europa we dont use lol
_MrKnight_ - LordDioski eisk,tiger and tlk are partnered director of the host with equal share
_MrKnight_ - We share our work so we can reduce to work time and effort
_MrKnight_ - And if anyone want you can come in the host and verify your self because we are innocent and we dint done a single thing illegally
EiskalterFreund - we don't do that things anymore. Even tho we didn't know it, we are currently legal
Toki0179 - NexusGamers You didn't know about it yet after it all happened you still decide to keep him as a staff member. In fact he is an executive on the server now.
Toki0179 - sad ‚òπÔ∏è  I got banned from rednodes discord server for posting this ‚òπÔ∏è
Toki0179 - _MrKnight_ you literally cant make this claim when I have the evidence of snip nip admitting to carding
Toki0179 - oh yeah forgot to add thing bout privacy policy. Its kinda trash also at some points I literally can't understand it but i dont know much about privacy policies I just think its missing a few things
_MrKnight_ - Toki0179 it is snip he said you did absolutely nothing to be staff even you where not active in staff chat
_MrKnight_ - Toki0179 I think it's perfect and why I need even to make a policy for a dint launched host lol first let me launch it dude
_MrKnight_ - Toki0179 snip is my friend and I can't kick him out because he is having some irl issues I want to support him
_MrKnight_ - Toki0179 lol can I say something he dint carded it was Mgc ( snip was Mgc former dev) they carded and when they got exposed by snip he got fired or something idk mch about it
_MrKnight_ - Again saying if you have any issue come to rednodes and try yourself
Deleted User - e, this is all lies, LIES, I don't believe this thread its liessss
Toki0179 - NovaismyRoommate How can you say that when I literally have the screenshots as proof of snip nip admitting to carding and then also the unpaid invoice of $192.05 üòêÔ∏è
Toki0179 - also let me just add that they are literally admitting to it by saying "this was in the past" and stuff along those lines
Deleted User - Toki0179 Im joking, redknight is my friend but idrc about his hosting server
CursedHoliday - So you know rednodes...
Say all the roles that created.
_MrKnight_ - CursedHoliday ?
_MrKnight_ - Toki0179 Idc lol we dint know the node was brought illegally so yeah I don't care
eraters - "i didnt know it was illegal to rob a bank so i dont think i should be in trouble"
LordDioski - Give this man a Confirmed
_MrKnight_ - LordDioski Lol now idc about winterhoax also because iknow we dint did any illegal activities
candy - hi
_MrKnight_ - Hi
Deleted User - hi
_MrKnight_ - eraters A question is winterhoax legally registered as a fraud activity exposing thingy or just a buch of kids yelling at others for things which they dint do ?
Garuda2703 - E
AkemiReal - yes this is true
AkemiReal - CursedHoliday hi
eraters - _MrKnight_ A question is your host legally registered as a hosting platform thingy or just a buch of kids failing at making a hosting service ?
_MrKnight_ - eraters Lmao the best answer ever got asking questions to make my question censored lol wow what a wonderful move so here is my answer my host isn't launched so why would I need to register first let it launch üòÇüòÇüòÇ
AkemiReal - eraters no
AkemiReal - eraters I don't think this is a registered hosting company
eraters - _MrKnight_ why would we need to register a forums page then??
_MrKnight_ - eraters Aha now I'm not worried about this (even we are Fully legal) this is just twitter or insta just an area to chat around ( I thought the govt is involved here üòÇ)
_MrKnight_ - AkemiReal Why we need to first let's launch
NexusGamers - Toki0179 in rednodes to fire executive we need a meeting we cannot just fire executive without meeting
Jedrik - _MrKnight_ and who says we need to be registered? It's a fucking forum
Jedrik - _MrKnight_ "fully legal"
_MrKnight_ - Jedrik Do you mind being a bit polite and stop swearing
_MrKnight_ - Jedrik Lol why now I need to care about a silly forum 

Which is useless
Jedrik - _MrKnight_ ‚ùÑÔ∏è
Jedrik - _MrKnight_ no one said you needed to care? just let your reputation be ruined, not like you can counter any of the proof given in the thread
Jedrik - _MrKnight_ Which is useless

and yet here you are, still posting on the thread
_MrKnight_ - Jedrik I had dmed sloth the entire story I think he can understand
_MrKnight_ - Jedrik Because why not

EmeraldMike - mituishere pft who needs a guide to that LOL
_MrKnight_ - mituishere SHUSH dont expose me!
Agn001 - _MrKnight_ 
Firstly, This thread is about REDHOST.
Secondly, Do you have any proofs to make such a comment that MGC was carding? 
If so, As an admin i would like to see that!

Next, on About Snip Nip, being banned from MGC,

He was banned since he tried to hack MGU's game panel! We has relevant proofs to prove that too! 
Attached image is he sending me messages about hacking MGU's panel. We do also have him asking for help for cracking MGU's Petrodactyl panel! 

Also, since you firmly claimed that mgc carded, i really want to see proofs or you need to be sorry for it in this ticket, else i will looking forward legal way. Since you guys are admitting that snip nip had carded and proofs are put up, it wont be hard for me to find my own way! 

Image proofs:

_MrKnight_
_MrKnight_ - its the same snip nip said mgc used carding and he was your dev so as usual i just belived him
_MrKnight_ - and the same redhost is rednodes
just a rewamp
Agn001 - _MrKnight_  Well, You believed to a small 13year old boy who banned in 13+ malayalam community that too without a single proof!

You really need to apologize to that comment which you put up earlier or we find our own way!
_MrKnight_ - and sorry for this issues im stopping everything (not closing rednodes im leaving from it ):/
Agn001 - _MrKnight_ Well, This issue is no way related to me! You need to clearly write down apologizes for putting down MGC's name for claiming things without a proof!
_MrKnight_ - Agn001 idc anymore tho
you ask the current staff of rednodes and ashwin
Agn001 - _MrKnight_ Well, You are the one who claimed it and you are the one who is supposed to apologize!
_MrKnight_ - enik sorry parayan saukaryam illa
Agn001 - _MrKnight_ Ok mahn! We'll find our own ways!
Garuda2703 - hi
_MrKnight_ - Agn001 Ok man do your best I don't really care
EiskalterFreund - Please again we don't do carding anymore ;(... Me crying
CursedHoliday - Ok stop with these stupid fucking threads üò° üò° üò°
rednodes/redhost is about to fucking die really soon
If yall complaining that rednodes/redhost using a carding method to get free vps or abuse it
Just go complain at fucking snip nip, don't say that here and stop making redhost/rednodes die üò°

Imma just kill snip nip at this point when i had done with this redhost/rednodes threads which makes me fucking mad üò°
Tomas - CursedHoliday ok??
CursedHoliday - Stop with making those fucking stuff that makes rednodes died or go blame to stupid fucking idiot kid snip nip - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-03-26/1616781090-769852-image.png

Sydney said, go back to preschool you limp raw and unwanted chicken nugget
mtt - @CursedHoliday To expand upon what Jedrik said, go back to preschool you limp raw unwanted crybaby wack chicken nugget
Agn001 - EiskalterFreund Whatever i personally require sorry from @_MrKnight_ for claiming a statement which is not true and posting in such a forum! Else the the thread will continue. (Its not any type of blackmailing or anything, but claiming such an illegal activity on this without proof is not good!)
EiskalterFreund - Agn001 We dont do any illegal things since months soo please stop this üò≠
mtt - EiskalterFreund Do you think we‚Äôre going to believe you without proof? Cry about it  dude
Toki0179 - EiskalterFreund The fact that you are saying "anymore" is actually hilarious.  You are literally admitting that you guys did it
Toki0179 - CursedHoliday Why should we just complain about snip nip? We should be complaining about the whole host because they were using the node that was obtained illegally. Also they kept snip nip as a member of the staff team I think they even went and gave him a promotion. Also have you seen the privacy policy? Because that stuff is just not valid. How can you even try and defend this host?
Toki0179 - _MrKnight_ Nah its a bunch of kids yelling at people for the dirty shit the hosts have done
AkemiReal - Wtf is wrong with the nodes bruh.. Getting illegal nodes again? - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-03-27/1616805051-74593-screenshot-2021-03-27-07-28-38-84.png
AkemiReal - EiskalterFreund NOU
_MrKnight_ - First thing is I'm closing rednodes secondly I wil make new and I will not be taking anyone as staff thirdly this will only happen when I'm 18 because I'm going to build custom panel with inbuild console and lastly "mr.agn" i will no t say sorry and idc about this thread because no one can ruin my new hosting because I'm well planned this time üôÇ
Tomas - _MrKnight_ Hey!

Just letting you know that you may wanna reorder your incentives.

It helps that you can speak English to properly talk with clients &amp; the users on this forum.

Move your priorities to learning English!

_MrKnight_ - candy Not mine lol it's my staff whom started new so it's not related üòÇ
candy - Your staff is there so (üôÇ
_MrKnight_ - candy So? Im the founder and owner of rednodes and rednodes have nothing to do with them
candy - eh you shouldnt trust DNDW
_MrKnight_ - candy I don't care about dndw lol if you want go check purenodes
Toki0179 - candy its basically the same host. tbh they have all the same staff and everything but just different name
candy - Toki0179 Yep, same everything
CursedHoliday - Toki0179 OMG STOP MAKING ALL THE HOST DYING, STOP WITH THIS SHIT.
Iceey - hoes mad
Jedrik - mad hoes
Garuda2703 - hoe
candy - CursedHoliday Tryna protect a host that he works on!
EiskalterFreund - We did not do anything he just makes this to make me sad, purenodes has nothing to do with RedNodes üôÅ
candy - crybaby
EiskalterFreund - It makes me sad, that people exist who try to make anything dead which somebody makes and doesn't have anything to do with anything other, I just want to make a host and nobody has to make something bad. &gt;:[, that makes me angry and sad currently, I wish WinterHoax or maybe only toki never existed
Iceey - EiskalterFreund Your feelings are irrelevant when you're committing crimes
_MrKnight_ - Can I say something? Rednodes amd purnodes are node related to each other. Im thr owner of rednodes. Eisk was dev not the owner . How can you say purenodes did crime ? For example: if I did a crime then I join a company how you say the company did the crime ? Rednodes have nothing to do with pure nodes I'm the owner of rednodes and I'm saying idont have anything to do with pure nodes
_MrKnight_ - Example again: alot of people says falix is bad so if Huss is working In falix will it make idley bad? No! they both are different hosts  and they don't have anything to do with eachother!
_MrKnight_ - EiskalterFreund Dont be sad this muffins are trying to make you emotional
_MrKnight_ - And I have dndw not the owner of pure nodes!
Toki0179 - sadge this lost confirmed ‚òπÔ∏è
