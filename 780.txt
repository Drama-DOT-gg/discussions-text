NighMayHigh - Hi Fellow Minecrafters,

Today we have gathered here, to witness the drama.gg thread on SumUp (payment idiots)

Issue 1.

These pathetic morons, took over a week to process a simple refund to our dear friend iceey, this was very annoying, and is bad.

Issue 2.

You would have thought that that was the last of sumup being retarded? right? 
No. you are wrong. We took payment for ellis's gpu stash for 3k on friday, we were told that payments take 3 days to be paid to me, and that i would get payment on tuesday, this hasnt happened and their STINKY SUPPORT dosent reply to anyone after 4pm, SERIOUSLY WHY CLOSE AT 4PM, EVEN FALIXNODES IN 24/7
