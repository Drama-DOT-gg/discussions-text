Daps - A completely unmatured community which owned by some kids always can't handle things well, moderators not responding to chat and even tried to reach out to them by sending dms in Discord they just completely ignore even they are online, my friend even got a super dumb replied when he is asking to take down a misleading thread, their reply is "You should handle it yourself". Am I going to take down your site or something?
FatGrizzly - who was that mod?
Daps - FatGrizzly Not going to shame him in public, but pretty sure there are just a few mods
FatGrizzly - Daps 

Daps my friend even got a super dumb replied when he is asking to take down a misleading thread, their reply is "You should handle it yourself"

or mind telling who your friend and the thread link is?
Daps - FatGrizzly You're not mod right? Pretty sure this is non of your business
FatGrizzly - Daps if you aren't gonna tell that, there is no point in this thread kid
Kowone - heh, another pointless thread
Daps - FatGrizzly My friend doesn't allow me to point out the thread, so I can't do it here, sorry
FatGrizzly - Daps then get the fuck out, literally a pointless thread then
Daps - It's a self reflection thread for the community in drama.gg
Shershah - You should give us thread link.
FatGrizzly - Daps its more like a YOU problem
Kowone - i can't see any point of this thread ðŸ¤·
Daps - Shershah Easy one, let me put out an example.
https://drama.gg/d/885-infinityfree-shitty-services/8
The thread is completely off topic for accusing a company which doesn't have any faults on the company itself, it's the community problem, it's so dumb that the moderator just locked the thread and not marking it as resolved or deleting it. 

Why does marking is resolved or deleting it important?
It clears out the thread from the robots.txt, you can see it yourself
Daps - FatGrizzly Because dumb community didn't realize their problem
YusufYaser - Screenshot?

Oh by the way, I own Google
Daps - YusufYaser You can look it up yourself, dumbass
Kowone - Daps omg omg so your friend owns infinityfree? omg omg omgggg omfggg
YusufYaser - Daps their reply is "You should handle it yourself".

How am I supposed to find this out myself? Hacking your discord account to see your DMs?
Daps - Kowone This is where shit community comes in, I clearly stated for example
Kowone - Daps LOL ðŸ¤£
Daps - YusufYaser Are you fucking retarded? I am not going to shame him in public
Kowone - i love it when this person refused to state who is the person and which one is the thread about them ðŸ¤£ and get fucking mad because none of the mods could solve his friend's thread
YusufYaser - Daps You can blur out the name and profile picture. Simple
FatGrizzly - Kowone bruh no, you are wrong
because none of the mods could solve his his thread.

this kid is an alt 100%
Daps - Kowone This is why community is not improving, taking advices as jokes.

Edit: Maybe it's, just backwards
Kowone - feel free to keep shitposting, none of us could solve it for ya
Kowone - FatGrizzly i can see that very well
FatGrizzly - Kowone no u
Kowone - also, i thought shitposting aren't allowed?
Daps - Good luck for drama.gg shutting down, can't even handle DDoS attack
FatGrizzly - Daps ðŸ¤¡
YusufYaser - Daps so how are you gonna do that? spamming the ping command in your command prompt?
FatGrizzly - YusufYaser bruh no, open 100 chrome tabs and refresh em :joy:
YusufYaser - FatGrizzly Yeah, I have heard that this method brings Google's site down too!
Daps - YusufYaser Not going to call you dumb but go ahead
YusufYaser - Daps Bring drama's website down. Come on
Giyu - Daps just wondering , u used vpn right? while talking here and ddosing the site
Giyu - dxqt asshole shut the fuck up, u are making this worst
dxqt - Giyu k
Giyu - also daps, we cant find out the situation without u revealing the thread name and the acusers name because its a forum not a company so every user is equal or else why do a forum exist?
Giyu - FatGrizzly lol
YusufYaser - YusufYaser @Daps Where's the response for this message?
Giyu - YusufYaser can we um talk this properly than creating more fight lol

SnailDOS - Daps my dog looks like a h
calcal - Daps badsk alt moment &lt;3 we all know what he did, fraud, some other illegal shit, he's also 12
Deleted User - oke
FatGrizzly - mituishere oke
DeadBush - Daps That isnt shaming that is keeping out your views. And if it actually true then you should give the moderator name with proof so he can be expelled from being moderator and better ones may get a chance. So by looking at how you denying everything looks like you are just trying to seek attention
YusufYaser - YusufYaser @Daps My question is still not answered.
Thominek - DeadBush posting bad stuffs about Drama.gg on Drama.gg lul
DeadBush - Thominek ikr
Aaron_ - funny thread
Deleted User - FatGrizzly oke
FatGrizzly - mituishere oke
Deleted User - FatGrizzly oke

Thanks.
