obsidianmc - If you want them to be not laggy buy a plan 
I bet their plans suck too
They don't even say what they use for their node

Flash Host is supposed to sound like its fast and high performance
but it is the opposite

THey violate Trustpilot TOS by having an employee make a 5 star review to undo all the 1 star reviews that the customers put as this is a shitty host

DeadBush - Ok So they they they legally own MultyHost.


but when I asked them some questions if they are legally registered or have any documents so they legally own MultyHost they don't seem to answer.
I asked them few days ago and they didn't answer - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-20/1624160154-791420-img-20210620-092142.jpg

SidisLiveYT - DeadBush Nope they just gave the money to the kiddo rehaan and they are making invoice as a proof for buying , Btw I am not spreading hate , Am just saying what i know ! ðŸ˜€
JohnDoee - Flash host got yet another staff member to review their server I have no evidence as they deleted it before I could get any proof they are breaking tos again!
JohnDoee - JohnDoee more action should be taken this host gets away with alot of things its twice now!!
HarryW - JohnDoee Sorry about that. A staff member did not realise this and they left a review without realising it was violating TrustPilot TOS. We quickly told the staff member to delete the review because we noticed we were violating TrustPilot TOS, We are sorry about this and we assure you it will not happen again.
JohnDoee - HarryW well maybe you should teach ur staff what not to do before running a host their will be further action made I'm already on top of this !
JohnDoee - Someone in FlashHost made an racial comment about people and they claim they only just saw it even tho one of there staff clearly saw the comment made and yet they didnt do anything about it!
rhys - JohnDoee As we said, we didn't see the message. We get that it was racist and action has also been taken on the staff, but we would of deleted the message ASAP. 

We also said this in chat. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-21/1624300511-84773-staffseen.png
JohnDoee - rhys ur so stupid a staff member was there so why didnt he take action!!
rhys - JohnDoee As we said again, we've taken action on the staff for that. 
Also would like to point out "ur so stupid " when you said this - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-21/1624300966-154090-unknown.png
JohnDoee - rhys but who tf is Kate and jaiden I don't understand
rhys - JohnDoee Your personality disorder.
JohnDoee - rhys how do u know about that.... I mean wdym???
rhys - JohnDoee You've told me before, and you've said on a Drama.gg thread also. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-21/1624302240-725868-jaiden.png
JohnDoee - rhys stop exposing my friends
SidisLiveYT - JohnDoee then Stop being stupid , let them work Imao ðŸ¤£
Jaiden - bro not even me
Jaiden - I kinda happy i dont own this host anymore its even worse
Jaiden - DeadBush i legal own multyhost
obsidianmc - Well I left the host
I couldn't even connect to my server
Jaxon - "you're violating trustpilot tos" - ðŸ¤“
HarryW - Jaiden No I legally own MultyHost but we are not going to start pathetic drama over this again.
Xpert - I would agree they are violating TrustPilot ToS. Firstly you cannot legally own a company at the age of 13 in the UK, US, and Canada I believe. Secondly they have impersonated me saying that I "Like FlashHost."  I do not and I never will like FlashHost. Thirdly I personally think FlashHost should get investigated by Discord as their discord server was bought from a random gay. He even flat out said he bought the discord server and he made a excuse that was 
"I didn't know that it was against Discord ToS"
HarryW - Xpert First thing we never impersonated you that was someone we know and that has been all sorted out with them. We do not need to be a registered company because we make less than 12K a year and you also tried threatening to DDOS us many times and you have also threatened me to buy a VPS for you many times when you said couldnâ€™t afford a VPS at that time I fell for it and kept buying you VPS's but soon I found out you used me for VPS's and didnâ€™t like me at all.! You were also incredibly homophobic and racist saying the N word and the F slur which many people found incredibly offensive. You also threatened to dox me many times before. You also called us skids because we were using Pterodactyl Panel and you demanded that you made our own panel. A new panel is not in the works but our aim is to customise pterodactyl and with the Discord server again I did not know it was violating the Discord Rules and if I knew it was now I would not of bought the discord server.
rhys - Xpert Harry's mostly covered everything here, i just want to talk about you attempting to DDOS US

So you tried to bring up old drama then you said you can "deface our website forever" 


Then we have 



&amp; on your other account your saying we used "premade software" ðŸ¤¨ðŸ¤¨



Then you getting accused of saying the N Word 





So making loads of drama for no reason is quite pathetic. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-23/1627031239-247681-screenshot-20210723-095626-discord.jpg

rhys - ok... - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-23/1627062940-208736-screenshot-20210723-184830-discord.jpg
DeadBush - HarryW you dont have any legal documents saying you own MultyHost. Learn some laws kid
Iceey - DeadBush Learn some laws kid
Fallen_ - HarryW It's not just about making profit, it's about conducting business and handling peoples personal information. If you have any type of activity in which you make business expenses and handle money paid by clients, no matter the profit margin, this has to be reported to the appropriate government. (I just popped in, I have no idea what this thread is about, just giving legal advice.)
Kowone - HarryW you're basically the second best idiot kid around here after badsk
DeadBush - Iceey ik my grammar sucks
DeadBush - Kowone lol
Kowone - HarryW probably 4th after lamaker and oliver?

Jaiden - HarryW i do pay vat
HarryW - Jaiden Okay please may I have the VAT number to check you are registered or your countries equivalent?
Ibrahim - Jaxon they aren't even our staff anymore, they've been fired. and also they submitted the review without our concent, it's not our fault.

Ibrahim - obsidianmc submit ur review again once u have, tysm
Jaiden - HarryW I own the company You never bought it from me so legal its still mine idc about it anymore last time I will post here
Jaiden - Jaiden if I see you claim to own multyhost I will get my manager to deal with it.
HarryW - Jaiden If you don't care why did you get your alts to keep joining us and disturbing FlashHost?
rhys - Jaiden clearly you don't care so much...





so you coming back on alts is "you not caring"
makes sense - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-11/1628678483-301986-1624300966-154090-unknown.png

IoNetty - JohnDoee I got sys admin in flashhost. Few minutes later I wanted ptero admin added. Next: The co owner deleted my account on accident? It was linked to dashactyl and that can't be fixed too easily. Nice job
