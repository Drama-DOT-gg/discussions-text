funeral - I'm an ex-owner of oceaned.host (igna) here to explain a few things about what happened and why we got into this drama.

Let's start with the first thing: Dan Bot Hosting.
Yes, Woosh (ex-owner of oceaned) mined Duino-Coin on their Nodes - https://i.imgur.com/IZjXji8.png). In my case, I mined Monero using MXRig, but I did stop after a little while.

"Promoting" suicide.
Every time "kys" or something similar was said, it was a joke, and obviously we didn't mean it. We are sorry to the people who have been affected by this and didn't take it as a joke.

Racism. 
Yes, we do admit that there was racism on our server, we're sorry that the rules were never enforced.

"Pedophile" staff.
People have made claims that some of our staff are pedophiles. They're not wrong.
A thread has already been made about Floppa, so we will talk about Thanik. They were a Staff Manager who posted images/videos of underage girls and boys, which was promtly deleted by me. We are sorry for this. 

Server raids.
We have been accused of raiding DBH although this was never done by us. Hunolog, a friend of ours decided to raid DBH's discord server completely on his own, with no endorsement from us.


Fraud/Carding
The nodes used for panel.floppa.lol (down now) are from AWS Free Trial, using a method provided by Floppa. Due to them being carded, there was a big risk of data loss. Aswell as this, the domain 'oceaned.host' was carded from a 'known' registrar called strato using an old method.
