RumGuru - honk#9930 -
So i meet honk while James(leo) and him owned cubemc(host).
And after like a month we talked a bit about domain he was buying for mjcloud.

+---------------------------------------------------------------+

I saw that he was reopening mjcloud and i asked him if he wants to open "valence host" with me instead of mjcloud, he was suspicious but then he agreed, he agreed because he asked lellis if im good or not.

+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Then i invite him to discord, gave him perms and all that stuff and we were planning to open soon.
After couple of days he then said this as "joke" 

+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Later on he said this and he didnt joke this time
Then he said he will give 10$ to help me out with host and he wanted to be owner, i said no.


+---------------------------------------------------------------+

After couple of days he said that he is getting some good nodes and he wanted to merge valence to mjcloud 
I said that valence is not a thing.
Then he said that he would love to if i helped him with mjcloud
I said yes and i was positive about it

+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Now things are starting to get good.
He wanted to use me for money, he asked if i could help him pay for nodes.
after that he asked me if i have good gpu becuse he wanted me to mine so he can earn money for nodes
He said i would enter his wallet and mine money for him.
i said "maybe but later" - i wouldnt mine i just said that so he would stop asking me to mine.
Then he said he will give me executive if i mine with his wallet thing

after that i said "i dont need to be executive"

+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Later when we talked he just randomly said "im scamming a kid gimme a sec"

Then he said he is kidding(i think he was lying) and he said he is coding his spam bot


+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Then i started to "fix" mjcloud, i made rules and he said this.

That was the time he started to be toxic!
Then he said he will ban me if i remake discord(he said that in annoucement)

Then for no reason he demoted me to manager


+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Then he got mad because one guy wanted to partner, i said to guy "send me your discord link and i will check it"
I didnt even accept partnership or deny it and honk got mad because i didnt ping him so he can "manage" that partnership(he became toxic again)


+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Later i asked him why did he give people 25gb per server he  said this

And also he removed my admin perms after that.

I gave myself perms because role below me had admin perms and he puted that role above me and i didnt have it.
Now you will see some screenshots from staff chat where he was toxic as hell and where he admited that he is 9.

+---------------------------------------------------------------+

First he got mad because i renamed MJCloud from "MJCloud - Reimagine Free Host" to "MJCloud - Free Host"
Then he started to saying that im copying falix nodes name lmfao(like almost every free host has this name)


He wanted to be "original" lmao


+---------------------------------------------------------------+

I told him that he was toxic

He said that he is only toxic when he is mad, i told him that he is always toxic

Also here is more pictures of him swearing/being toxic

Then i also started swearing at him as a joke.


+---------------------------------------------------------------+

More screenshots


Then he wanted to mute me and he was saying some dumb stuff about about falix websites html files lmfao


+---------------------------------------------------------------+

More toxic screen shots and he tried to mute me

He is also even more toxic and he likes to swear at his customers/users






+---------------------------------------------------------------+

He also dm adverised on my host lmao


And then he accused me that someone or me tokken logged him lmfao
Like i was on phone and i never sended him any link or anthying
and i dont know how to tokken log





+---------------------------------------------------------------+

He also told me to make drama.gg post so mjcloud can be more popular(later in dm he said that he was joking lmao)




+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Proof that he is underaged


So idk if he is 9 or 7 lmao

+---------------------------------------------------------------+

END
So what can we all agree?
That honk is operating his host illegaly, he is a dumb kid, underaged and toxic.
Should we report him to discord for being underaged?
I will let you guys decide that.

First he got mad because i renamed MJCloud from "MJCloud - Reimagine Free Host" to "MJCloud - Free Host"
Then he started to saying that im copying falix nodes name lmfao(like almost every free host has this name)


He wanted to be "original" lmao


+---------------------------------------------------------------+

I told him that he was toxic

He said that he is only toxic when he is mad, i told him that he is always toxic

Also here is more pictures of him swearing/being toxic

Then i also started swearing at him as a joke.


+---------------------------------------------------------------+

More screenshots


Then he wanted to mute me and he was saying some dumb stuff about about falix websites html files lmfao


+---------------------------------------------------------------+

More toxic screen shots and he tried to mute me

He is also even more toxic and he likes to swear at his customers/users






+---------------------------------------------------------------+

He also dm adverised on my host lmao


And then he accused me that someone or me tokken logged him lmfao
Like i was on phone and i never sended him any link or anthying
and i dont know how to tokken log





+---------------------------------------------------------------+

He also told me to make drama.gg post so mjcloud can be more popular(later in dm he said that he was joking lmao)




+---------------------------------------------------------------+

+---------------------------------------------------------------+

RumGuru - honk#9930 -
So i meet honk while James(leo) and him owned cubemc(host).
And after like a month we talked a bit about domain he was buying for mjcloud.

+---------------------------------------------------------------+

I saw that he was reopening mjcloud and i asked him if he wants to open "valence host" with me instead of mjcloud, he was suspicious but then he agreed, he agreed because he asked lellis if im good or not.

+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Then i invite him to discord, gave him perms and all that stuff and we were planning to open soon.
After couple of days he then said this as "joke" 

+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Later on he said this and he didnt joke this time
Then he said he will give 10$ to help me out with host and he wanted to be owner, i said no.


+---------------------------------------------------------------+

After couple of days he said that he is getting some good nodes and he wanted to merge valence to mjcloud 
I said that valence is not a thing.
Then he said that he would love to if i helped him with mjcloud
I said yes and i was positive about it

+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Now things are starting to get good.
He wanted to use me for money, he asked if i could help him pay for nodes.
after that he asked me if i have good gpu becuse he wanted me to mine so he can earn money for nodes
He said i would enter his wallet and mine money for him.
i said "maybe but later" - i wouldnt mine i just said that so he would stop asking me to mine.
Then he said he will give me executive if i mine with his wallet thing

after that i said "i dont need to be executive"

+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Later when we talked he just randomly said "im scamming a kid gimme a sec"

Then he said he is kidding(i think he was lying) and he said he is coding his spam bot


+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Then i started to "fix" mjcloud, i made rules and he said this.

That was the time he started to be toxic!
Then he said he will ban me if i remake discord(he said that in annoucement)

Then for no reason he demoted me to manager


+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Then he got mad because one guy wanted to partner, i said to guy "send me your discord link and i will check it"
I didnt even accept partnership or deny it and honk got mad because i didnt ping him so he can "manage" that partnership(he became toxic again)


+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Later i asked him why did he give people 25gb per server he  said this

And also he removed my admin perms after that.

I gave myself perms because role below me had admin perms and he puted that role above me and i didnt have it.
Now you will see some screenshots from staff chat where he was toxic as hell and where he admited that he is 9.

After couple of days he then said this as "joke" 

+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Later on he said this and he didnt joke this time
Then he said he will give 10$ to help me out with host and he wanted to be owner, i said no.


+---------------------------------------------------------------+

After couple of days he said that he is getting some good nodes and he wanted to merge valence to mjcloud 
I said that valence is not a thing.
Then he said that he would love to if i helped him with mjcloud
I said yes and i was positive about it

+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Now things are starting to get good.
He wanted to use me for money, he asked if i could help him pay for nodes.
after that he asked me if i have good gpu becuse he wanted me to mine so he can earn money for nodes
He said i would enter his wallet and mine money for him.
i said "maybe but later" - i wouldnt mine i just said that so he would stop asking me to mine.
Then he said he will give me executive if i mine with his wallet thing

after that i said "i dont need to be executive"

+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Later when we talked he just randomly said "im scamming a kid gimme a sec"

Then he said he is kidding(i think he was lying) and he said he is coding his spam bot


+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Then i started to "fix" mjcloud, i made rules and he said this.

That was the time he started to be toxic!
Then he said he will ban me if i remake discord(he said that in annoucement)

Then for no reason he demoted me to manager


+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Then he got mad because one guy wanted to partner, i said to guy "send me your discord link and i will check it"
I didnt even accept partnership or deny it and honk got mad because i didnt ping him so he can "manage" that partnership(he became toxic again)


+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Later i asked him why did he give people 25gb per server he  said this

And also he removed my admin perms after that.

I gave myself perms because role below me had admin perms and he puted that role above me and i didnt have it.
Now you will see some screenshots from staff chat where he was toxic as hell and where he admited that he is 9.

+---------------------------------------------------------------+

First he got mad because i renamed MJCloud from "MJCloud - Reimagine Free Host" to "MJCloud - Free Host"
Then he started to saying that im copying falix nodes name lmfao(like almost every free host has this name)


He wanted to be "original" lmao


+---------------------------------------------------------------+

I told him that he was toxic

He said that he is only toxic when he is mad, i told him that he is always toxic

Also here is more pictures of him swearing/being toxic

Then i also started swearing at him as a joke.


+---------------------------------------------------------------+

More screenshots


Then he wanted to mute me and he was saying some dumb stuff about about falix websites html files lmfao


+---------------------------------------------------------------+

More toxic screen shots and he tried to mute me

He is also even more toxic and he likes to swear at his customers/users






+---------------------------------------------------------------+

He also dm adverised on my host lmao


And then he accused me that someone or me tokken logged him lmfao
Like i was on phone and i never sended him any link or anthying
and i dont know how to tokken log





+---------------------------------------------------------------+

He also told me to make drama.gg post so mjcloud can be more popular(later in dm he said that he was joking lmao)




+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Proof that he is underaged


So idk if he is 9 or 7 lmao

+---------------------------------------------------------------+

END
So what can we all agree?
That honk is operating his host illegaly, he is a dumb kid, underaged and toxic.
Should we report him to discord for being underaged?
I will let you guys decide that.

RumGuru - honk#9930 -
So i meet honk while James(leo) and him owned cubemc(host).
And after like a month we talked a bit about domain he was buying for mjcloud.

+---------------------------------------------------------------+

I saw that he was reopening mjcloud and i asked him if he wants to open "valence host" with me instead of mjcloud, he was suspicious but then he agreed, he agreed because he asked lellis if im good or not.

+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Then i invite him to discord, gave him perms and all that stuff and we were planning to open soon.
After couple of days he then said this as "joke" 

+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Later on he said this and he didnt joke this time
Then he said he will give 10$ to help me out with host and he wanted to be owner, i said no.


+---------------------------------------------------------------+

After couple of days he said that he is getting some good nodes and he wanted to merge valence to mjcloud 
I said that valence is not a thing.
Then he said that he would love to if i helped him with mjcloud
I said yes and i was positive about it

+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Now things are starting to get good.
He wanted to use me for money, he asked if i could help him pay for nodes.
after that he asked me if i have good gpu becuse he wanted me to mine so he can earn money for nodes
He said i would enter his wallet and mine money for him.
i said "maybe but later" - i wouldnt mine i just said that so he would stop asking me to mine.
Then he said he will give me executive if i mine with his wallet thing

after that i said "i dont need to be executive"

+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Later when we talked he just randomly said "im scamming a kid gimme a sec"

Then he said he is kidding(i think he was lying) and he said he is coding his spam bot


+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Then i started to "fix" mjcloud, i made rules and he said this.

That was the time he started to be toxic!
Then he said he will ban me if i remake discord(he said that in annoucement)

Then for no reason he demoted me to manager


+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Then he got mad because one guy wanted to partner, i said to guy "send me your discord link and i will check it"
I didnt even accept partnership or deny it and honk got mad because i didnt ping him so he can "manage" that partnership(he became toxic again)


+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Later i asked him why did he give people 25gb per server he  said this

And also he removed my admin perms after that.

I gave myself perms because role below me had admin perms and he puted that role above me and i didnt have it.
Now you will see some screenshots from staff chat where he was toxic as hell and where he admited that he is 9.

+---------------------------------------------------------------+

First he got mad because i renamed MJCloud from "MJCloud - Reimagine Free Host" to "MJCloud - Free Host"
Then he started to saying that im copying falix nodes name lmfao(like almost every free host has this name)


He wanted to be "original" lmao


+---------------------------------------------------------------+

I told him that he was toxic

He said that he is only toxic when he is mad, i told him that he is always toxic

Also here is more pictures of him swearing/being toxic

I said yes and i was positive about it

+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Now things are starting to get good.
He wanted to use me for money, he asked if i could help him pay for nodes.
after that he asked me if i have good gpu becuse he wanted me to mine so he can earn money for nodes
He said i would enter his wallet and mine money for him.
i said "maybe but later" - i wouldnt mine i just said that so he would stop asking me to mine.
Then he said he will give me executive if i mine with his wallet thing

after that i said "i dont need to be executive"

+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Later when we talked he just randomly said "im scamming a kid gimme a sec"

Then he said he is kidding(i think he was lying) and he said he is coding his spam bot


+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Then i started to "fix" mjcloud, i made rules and he said this.

That was the time he started to be toxic!
Then he said he will ban me if i remake discord(he said that in annoucement)

Then for no reason he demoted me to manager


+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Then he got mad because one guy wanted to partner, i said to guy "send me your discord link and i will check it"
I didnt even accept partnership or deny it and honk got mad because i didnt ping him so he can "manage" that partnership(he became toxic again)


+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Later i asked him why did he give people 25gb per server he  said this

And also he removed my admin perms after that.

I gave myself perms because role below me had admin perms and he puted that role above me and i didnt have it.
Now you will see some screenshots from staff chat where he was toxic as hell and where he admited that he is 9.

+---------------------------------------------------------------+

First he got mad because i renamed MJCloud from "MJCloud - Reimagine Free Host" to "MJCloud - Free Host"
Then he started to saying that im copying falix nodes name lmfao(like almost every free host has this name)


He wanted to be "original" lmao


+---------------------------------------------------------------+

I told him that he was toxic

He said that he is only toxic when he is mad, i told him that he is always toxic

Also here is more pictures of him swearing/being toxic

Then i also started swearing at him as a joke.


+---------------------------------------------------------------+

More screenshots


Then he wanted to mute me and he was saying some dumb stuff about about falix websites html files lmfao


+---------------------------------------------------------------+

More toxic screen shots and he tried to mute me

He is also even more toxic and he likes to swear at his customers/users






+---------------------------------------------------------------+

He also dm adverised on my host lmao


And then he accused me that someone or me tokken logged him lmfao
Like i was on phone and i never sended him any link or anthying
and i dont know how to tokken log





+---------------------------------------------------------------+

He also told me to make drama.gg post so mjcloud can be more popular(later in dm he said that he was joking lmao)




+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Proof that he is underaged


So idk if he is 9 or 7 lmao

+---------------------------------------------------------------+

END
So what can we all agree?
That honk is operating his host illegaly, he is a dumb kid, underaged and toxic.
Should we report him to discord for being underaged?
I will let you guys decide that.

RumGuru - honk#9930 -
So i meet honk while James(leo) and him owned cubemc(host).
And after like a month we talked a bit about domain he was buying for mjcloud.

+---------------------------------------------------------------+

I saw that he was reopening mjcloud and i asked him if he wants to open "valence host" with me instead of mjcloud, he was suspicious but then he agreed, he agreed because he asked lellis if im good or not.

+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Then i invite him to discord, gave him perms and all that stuff and we were planning to open soon.
After couple of days he then said this as "joke" 

+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Later on he said this and he didnt joke this time
Then he said he will give 10$ to help me out with host and he wanted to be owner, i said no.


+---------------------------------------------------------------+

After couple of days he said that he is getting some good nodes and he wanted to merge valence to mjcloud 
I said that valence is not a thing.
Then he said that he would love to if i helped him with mjcloud
I said yes and i was positive about it

+---------------------------------------------------------------+

RumGuru - honk#9930 -
So i meet honk while James(leo) and him owned cubemc(host).
And after like a month we talked a bit about domain he was buying for mjcloud.

+---------------------------------------------------------------+

I saw that he was reopening mjcloud and i asked him if he wants to open "valence host" with me instead of mjcloud, he was suspicious but then he agreed, he agreed because he asked lellis if im good or not.

+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Then i invite him to discord, gave him perms and all that stuff and we were planning to open soon.
After couple of days he then said this as "joke" 

+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Later on he said this and he didnt joke this time
Then he said he will give 10$ to help me out with host and he wanted to be owner, i said no.


+---------------------------------------------------------------+

After couple of days he said that he is getting some good nodes and he wanted to merge valence to mjcloud 
I said that valence is not a thing.
Then he said that he would love to if i helped him with mjcloud
I said yes and i was positive about it

+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Now things are starting to get good.
He wanted to use me for money, he asked if i could help him pay for nodes.
after that he asked me if i have good gpu becuse he wanted me to mine so he can earn money for nodes
He said i would enter his wallet and mine money for him.
i said "maybe but later" - i wouldnt mine i just said that so he would stop asking me to mine.
Then he said he will give me executive if i mine with his wallet thing

after that i said "i dont need to be executive"

+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Later when we talked he just randomly said "im scamming a kid gimme a sec"

Then he said he is kidding(i think he was lying) and he said he is coding his spam bot


+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Then i started to "fix" mjcloud, i made rules and he said this.

That was the time he started to be toxic!
Then he said he will ban me if i remake discord(he said that in annoucement)

Then for no reason he demoted me to manager


+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Then he got mad because one guy wanted to partner, i said to guy "send me your discord link and i will check it"
I didnt even accept partnership or deny it and honk got mad because i didnt ping him so he can "manage" that partnership(he became toxic again)


+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Later i asked him why did he give people 25gb per server he  said this

And also he removed my admin perms after that.

I gave myself perms because role below me had admin perms and he puted that role above me and i didnt have it.
Now you will see some screenshots from staff chat where he was toxic as hell and where he admited that he is 9.

+---------------------------------------------------------------+

First he got mad because i renamed MJCloud from "MJCloud - Reimagine Free Host" to "MJCloud - Free Host"
Then he started to saying that im copying falix nodes name lmfao(like almost every free host has this name)


He wanted to be "original" lmao


+---------------------------------------------------------------+

I told him that he was toxic

He said that he is only toxic when he is mad, i told him that he is always toxic

Also here is more pictures of him swearing/being toxic

Then i also started swearing at him as a joke.


+---------------------------------------------------------------+

More screenshots


Then he wanted to mute me and he was saying some dumb stuff about about falix websites html files lmfao


+---------------------------------------------------------------+

More toxic screen shots and he tried to mute me

He is also even more toxic and he likes to swear at his customers/users






+---------------------------------------------------------------+

He also dm adverised on my host lmao


And then he accused me that someone or me tokken logged him lmfao
Like i was on phone and i never sended him any link or anthying
and i dont know how to tokken log

+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Now things are starting to get good.
He wanted to use me for money, he asked if i could help him pay for nodes.
after that he asked me if i have good gpu becuse he wanted me to mine so he can earn money for nodes
He said i would enter his wallet and mine money for him.
i said "maybe but later" - i wouldnt mine i just said that so he would stop asking me to mine.
Then he said he will give me executive if i mine with his wallet thing

after that i said "i dont need to be executive"

+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Later when we talked he just randomly said "im scamming a kid gimme a sec"

Then he said he is kidding(i think he was lying) and he said he is coding his spam bot


+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Then i started to "fix" mjcloud, i made rules and he said this.

That was the time he started to be toxic!
Then he said he will ban me if i remake discord(he said that in annoucement)

Then for no reason he demoted me to manager


+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Then he got mad because one guy wanted to partner, i said to guy "send me your discord link and i will check it"
I didnt even accept partnership or deny it and honk got mad because i didnt ping him so he can "manage" that partnership(he became toxic again)


+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Later i asked him why did he give people 25gb per server he  said this

And also he removed my admin perms after that.

I gave myself perms because role below me had admin perms and he puted that role above me and i didnt have it.
Now you will see some screenshots from staff chat where he was toxic as hell and where he admited that he is 9.

+---------------------------------------------------------------+

First he got mad because i renamed MJCloud from "MJCloud - Reimagine Free Host" to "MJCloud - Free Host"
Then he started to saying that im copying falix nodes name lmfao(like almost every free host has this name)


He wanted to be "original" lmao


+---------------------------------------------------------------+

I told him that he was toxic

He said that he is only toxic when he is mad, i told him that he is always toxic

Also here is more pictures of him swearing/being toxic

Then i also started swearing at him as a joke.


+---------------------------------------------------------------+

More screenshots


Then he wanted to mute me and he was saying some dumb stuff about about falix websites html files lmfao


+---------------------------------------------------------------+

More toxic screen shots and he tried to mute me

He is also even more toxic and he likes to swear at his customers/users






+---------------------------------------------------------------+

He also dm adverised on my host lmao


And then he accused me that someone or me tokken logged him lmfao
Like i was on phone and i never sended him any link or anthying
and i dont know how to tokken log





+---------------------------------------------------------------+

He also told me to make drama.gg post so mjcloud can be more popular(later in dm he said that he was joking lmao)




+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Proof that he is underaged


So idk if he is 9 or 7 lmao

+---------------------------------------------------------------+

END
So what can we all agree?
That honk is operating his host illegaly, he is a dumb kid, underaged and toxic.
Should we report him to discord for being underaged?
I will let you guys decide that.

RumGuru - Also all screenshots are on phone so you cant say i edited them
honk - Dang, this is spicy. Anyways, I was kinda prepared because you leaked the fact that you will create this post.

You wanted to use me for money!
Where did I make you give me money, huh? I didn't force you to do that, I just wanted you to help me pay for nodes, not forcing you to do so or something like that.

You demoted me for no reason!
Yes, I did demote you, but not really. First of all, I made you management instead of executive, but then you were mad because I gave you a role a lower behind executive but with all perms except admin. I then got mad because you changed the server name in Discord to „MJCloud · Free hosting”, and then we got into a 'fight'.

You are a kid! You admitted to being 9 years old!
I am not a fucking kid, I am a teen you dumbass. Anyways, the „I'm 9 years old" thing was a joke. You never get jokes, don't you?

You were swearing
Yes, I was swearing. Why do you have anything against that?

Because that's what a kid would do (swear)
Again, I am a teen, you dumbass. I'm not a fucking kid. And if I was a kid, I would have probably backed up and closed my host, with no response to this thread.

You are toxic
I am toxic when you fucking make me mad, like right now. I'm usually calm, and not toxic, but you are making me mad like no one else. I think you should have a reward for that.

MJCloud doesn't have ToS or PP
Yes, for now of course. I'm still working on it, and working on 6 different things is hard - dashboard, node uptime, new nodes, checking drama.gg and searching for MJCloud every day, maintaining the server, and making ToS &amp; PP. Please understand this, I might release the ToS and PP tomorrow.
RumGuru - Death Threats?

lol funny af - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-24/1621847819-977400-whatsapp-image-2021-05-24-at-111458.jpg
honk - RumGuru I thought you learned what joke means, my guy.
(it was a fucking joke)
DHiro - It's always a joke man.
You should understand what jokes are.

I have worked with him several times.
He won't harm anyone.
RumGuru - honk 
You did want to use me for money, you asked me for gpu and my pc specs so i can mine for you.
 thats true but you still demoted for no reason
  i mean you are acting like a kid and you said it multiple times
  Yea i do have something against that, you are swearing at me and saying dumb stuff
   Most kids on internet swear like crazy
    6.You are always toxic even to your host users
    MJCloud is working for weeks already, even maybe a month!
RumGuru - DHiro ik james but still he is operating without tos&amp;pp and he is toxic asf
About underage thing im not 100% sure but he acts like 9 year old and he said it multiple times lmao
He is probably not 9 but he cant be much older
DHiro - He can demote anytime he wants.
It's his choice.
Also he is not underaged.
You also always act childish
DHiro - Well. You can ask for his old tos and pp.
It's probably somewher his website.
You should ask for it instead of making up stuff
DHiro - He is 15 mate
You're the one who is 15
RumGuru - DHiro Says a guy who closed 10 hosts, changed 20 names and 15 accounts lmao
Im 16 and also he doesnt have tos anywhere rn and he is be operating with it for like a month
DHiro - You are just blaming him when you just made him mad and stuff. Ofc he would swear if you do that
RumGuru - I didnt do anthying bad lmao
And in some screens he swears for no reason
And he isnt toxic just to me he is toxic to his community
Scroll up and see screenshots of him swearing a his members
DHiro - RumGuru never reached a month.
And I am the one who decides if I want to change my name or not.

And is it your host? It is mine. It is not your problem. Stop bringing up stuff that has been already resolved
honk - RumGuru 
I didn't force you to do so, bruh
You mean when I demoted you to member or when I made you management instead of executive?
You never get jokes, lesson learned.
Why the fuck are you scared of me swearing lmfao
Go cry to your mom about that lmao
I was toxic to him because he got me mad - he was complaining about quality and ignored the fact that it's a free host, what can he expect. And if he has some better hosts, then why does he use MJCloud? That makes no sense at all.
And no one had an issue with it so far, maybe it is a legal problem, but it'll be resolved maybe today or tomorrow.
honk - DHiro True
RumGuru - DHiro Im just saying your bad history, also no one would change accounts and names that much if he didnt do anthying bad lmao
honk - DHiro I still have a copy of it somewhere, I don't really know but if I searched hard enough for it, I would have probably found it. So yeah, that is true, too.
DHiro - Always saying bad bar bad you are acting like ur 12 rn. And again its still my choice to change my name or not. None of ur business
MythicalKitten - honk 
prob this
https://minejaj.cloud/legal/terms-of-service
https://minejaj.cloud/legal/privacy-policy
DHiro - Stop adding false tags btw
DHiro - MythicalKitten ooo rumguru i wonder what is this
RumGuru - honk 
You didnt because you cant, but you wanted to "trick me"
   And also minning kinda kills your gpu i think
When you demoted me to mg and took my admin perms.
 3.you acted like a kid soyea
 Where did i say im scared?
  Lmao so funny
     You were toxic to multiple people in chat as i remember
      You are operating without it for one month already am i right?
honk - Oh, by the way if I didn't respond to the scam thing - it was obviously a fucking joke lmfao. And the spam bot was to spam my DMs (while following Discord's rate limits) to 100 because I was bored.
RumGuru - MythicalKitten Ok you added it now, but still honk operated for one month without it!
RumGuru - DHiro 

DHiro which one is false?
RumGuru - DHiro why did you change names?
because you didnt want people to know that you closed 10 hosts and that you wiped nodes daily lmao
DHiro - Underage scamming.

You could have asked ror his legal info.
Scamming was pretty much a joke if you know what joke is.
He is 15 Mate
MythicalKitten - RumGuru no it was always there. it was done ages ago like over 2+ months ago
RumGuru - honk Sus and you are probably lying but idc
DHiro - RumGuru anny proof?
And i changed my name cuz i felt like it.
Never opened 10 hos.
Only did 2.
DHiro - MythicalKitten yep
RumGuru - DHiro You opened a lot and you changed names/accounts because you were scared
And also dont forget that you raided rolled host and stole their client.
RumGuru - MythicalKitten i mean you guys never announced neither did you put that link anywhere so idk if you uploaded it now or before
DHiro - RumGuru Stole their client LOL?
its corona admin
Also
WHO SAID I RAIDED ROLLED? Any proof lmfaoo
I opened 2 it was just rebranded and sold to different people
DHiro - RumGuru you could still have asked for it. It was there since first mjcloud
RumGuru - DHiro You did steal it, i dont have proof because that happened months ago, and also your hosts closed and opened every day lmao
One day closed and node wiped, other day opened again and that into loop
DHiro - This is just too childish lol.

Bye rumguru
RumGuru - DHiro they shouldve announce it and also that domain isnt domain that mjcloud usses
honk - RumGuru 

How did I want to trick you? By telling you to install a miner without your knowledge or what 🤣
And it doesn't affect your GPU if you actually clean your PC once in a while instead of leaving it on for 1 month and not cleaning it.
You didn't lose any perms, admin has all the perms, just it has access to all channels meanwhile the management role had all perms except admin, which only took away your access to some locked private channels you shouldn't have access to in the first place. It was my mistake to give you executive.
You act like a kid right now, just saying.
You seem scared, not 100% sure.
I know, right
Not really, maybe before MJCloud reopened, but I don't remember. After it reopened I've only was toxic to one guy, he made me real mad.
No? You can still access the old ToS and PP, @MythicalKitten linked it somewhere above
RumGuru - honk I will respond later, im in school rn
DHiro - RumGuru your talking about the everyone i posted and advertised my server?
Thats not called raiding mate.
And the theme was only putten there for temp. It was removed right after daft warned me.
And i only opened 2 and gave 48 hours for users to backup their data.
One is villagenodes then rebranded to cubemc and was sold to Rectrox
One is atomhost which didnt opened at all.

Now you have nothing to say. Just give up mate
DHiro - RumGuru ohh you scared
RumGuru - DHiro Says the guy that changed 10 accounts/names because he was scared of all the hate lmao
DHiro - RumGuru never got hate from anyone LMFAO
honk - RumGuru Bruh, the „hosts closed and opened every day” is false, DuoHost lasted for like 10+ days, before it was closed, not 1 day. And he didn't open immediately another host after that. DuoHost's nodes weren't wiped when DuoHost was a thing from what I remember.
DHiro - honk I didnt even owned duohost
Daft did
DHiro - Duo didnt even opened before it died
honk - RumGuru He only changed accounts once, and his account was actually deleted, check it yourself. If he wants to change his name, he can do that. You can't control his life.
RumGuru - honk im talking about other hosts before that
honk - RumGuru What do you mean? Villagenodes? Well then it's false too.
RumGuru - honk hahaha he changed accounts/names multiple times dont lie honk
DHiro - Yeah the other hosts its actually one
Villagenodes
Cubemc
Neocloud
Is all the same
RumGuru - DHiro No they arent same, only owner is same lmao
DHiro - RumGuru I changed name. And does it offend you?
DHiro - RumGuru it wwe just rebranded lmfao
RumGuru - DHiro no it doesnt, its just that you were scared, and you dont want people to know your past
honk - RumGuru He only changed them once, from what I remember. He might have changed the names multiple times, but why the fuck is changing your name bad?
RumGuru - DHiro and when you rebrand, you wipe nodes
RumGuru - honk he did change accounts mutliple time, and who changes his name 20 times lmao
honk - RumGuru They were the same, Villagenodes became CubeMC, CubeMC became NeoCloud after CubeMC was sold to Retrox. How dumb are you again?
DHiro - RumGuru your the most childish person I ever met.

I gave 48 hours to backup.
Then i just reseted the nodes.
And what does it still offend you?
Cain - honk if you really can't see the issue in constantly rebranding, I don't get how you can run a host of your own.

And if what RumGuru stated, every rebrand they clear the nodes, what is the point of starting up. Provide People with something reliable not something which is a high risk of being removed.
RumGuru - honk Bruh this thread is not about him, its about you.
But still every time he "rebrandes " he wipes nodes.
And rebranding that many times its stupid.
If he keeps going like that he will become new badsk lmao
DHiro - RumGuru I REBRANDED ONE LMFAO
RumGuru - Cain Exactly
DHiro - Cain Only did it once. And warned about it. And also gave some time to backup then sold it
RumGuru - DHiro Says the guy that is scared and changes his account/name every time he gets hat or closes host lmao
honk - Cain Ah I see.
RumGuru - DHiro Multiple times, also when you opened host, you told me you had like 10 customers, and then host closed, what happened to these customers , did you give them their money back?
Or did you scam them?
DHiro - RumGuru says the guy who actually changed spark 3 times

Never actually scared of anyone
DHiro - RumGuru Those are all my friends lol. I closed after all of those servers got expired lol
RumGuru - DHiro sus
DHiro - Also I'm selling a brain for cheap.
You must aswell interested in that
DHiro - RumGuru only 0.99$
RumGuru - DHiro About that it was raidedhost.com i just changed domain because domain was owned by tomas and i didnt want that. And then it was called sparknodes later one it closed because no one was using it, and i gave people like week to backup, but no one used it so no one need to backup, and 2 paid users i had i gave them their service and they had it until they didnt want to pay anymore.
RumGuru - DHiro You cant sell it because you dont have it
honk - RumGuru He told me the same thing in DMs about DuoHost, that it was all his friends, I believe him. That's not sus. Unless he lied, but there's like 1 in 10000 chance he would do that.
DHiro - RumGuru thats exactly what i did lmfao
honk - RumGuru Sorry but he has one, unlike you.
DHiro - Villagenodes.host domain was on random indian guy
RumGuru - DHiro i never wiped nodes and rebranded, i rebranded without wiping nodes, i just changed domain
DHiro - i actually just rebrand by warning people unlike you i never opened 10 hosts
RumGuru - DHiro rebranind/opening is kinda same, i just changed domain once lmao
DHiro - RumGuru imma just w8 for resolved
_MrKnight_ - I don't see a point in renaming a host , because he gave 48 hours time . Also if he want he can rename his discord account or he can use new account, you can't accuse him for that until you or ur dad owns discord 🤣🤣🤣, also about the old hosts , its a different story and different threads which all got fixed so , I don't see a reason to start quarrelling like a 9yo old idiotic dumb for something like that.
RumGuru - DHiro it cant be resolved, only tos&amp;pp can be resolved but thread cant
RumGuru - _MrKnight_ he dod bad stuff at past so he had to change accounts
honk - RumGuru It will get resolved, trust me.
DHiro - Scamming tos pp and underage is all false.
Only toxicity. Lets just earn him for now
RumGuru - DHiro scamming, he said he scammed a guy, tos&amp;pp can be fixed thats ok, underage: he said multiple times that he is 9/7 and he acts like that
DHiro - He is 15
Scamming is a joke 
Toxicity can be fixed
RumGuru - Like scroll up there is all proof that you need, if this threas gets mark resolved(which it wont im pretty sure)
thats gonna be stupid.
Because you cant resolve scamming/underaged/bad service lmao
RumGuru - DHiro You are a joke tbh lmao
DHiro - If he is really 9
Even 9 year old can make proper host than u LMFAO
honk - RumGuru Dude I already told you it was a joke, even in DMs lmfao
I'm not fucking 9 or 7 years old, you seem to be 9 or 7 though.
RumGuru - DHiro i can make proper host i just dont steal money from my parents like you and i dont have much time, i have something thats called "life"
And also again 
Says the guy that changed names/accounts and hosts multiple times lmao
RumGuru - honk Im 16 and you said multiple times that yo uare 9, you said its a joke later in dm lmao
honk - RumGuru Well you don't have a real proof for scamming, I'm not underaged and MJCloud isn't a bad service. We are trying to provide the highest quality. Our nodes aren't overloaded.
honk - honk We even have safe backups on our off-site backup server so that when there will be a data loss we can recover the data.
honk - RumGuru Ah yes I am 9 years old, totally real. Dude do I have to say that you never get jokes, again?
Ash777 - RumGuru i dont think he is 7 or 9 . i have talked to him and he doesnt act like that , having a noice humor doesn't make you a child
RumGuru - honk I didnt say that servers are bad quality but people are complaining that servers are laggy but i dont mind that.
i puted bad service because you swear at your users and your community
And i do have a proof of you scamming, you literally said it in one of screenshots i provided up there
RumGuru - Ash777 Like i said im not sure
RumGuru - honk You said it multiple times, and i would beleive it because you acting shows that you are maybe 9 year old
RumGuru - honk i never mentioned data loss
Ash777 - RumGuru you are claiming something that you are not sure about ? what do you even want ? everyone to hate @honk cuz you dont like him
honk - RumGuru Ah yes, only one guy said that and he was running Forge - that server requires a lot of RAM and CPU, not that much like a Tuinity or PaperMC server does. Again I only swore once, and it was for a reason. Alright but that's not real proof, how tf is me saying „i scammed a kid lmfao” proof? I was just making a bot and even provided image proof that I was making a cool bot to spam my DMs that also did follow Discord's ratelimits
honk - RumGuru Then why do you always mention it, if you're not sure? That doesn't make any sense at all, buddy.
RumGuru - Ash777 Nah, i provided all proof about everthying so yea, he is toxic, illegal activites, bad service and underage(not 100% sure)
RumGuru - honk hahahahhah once like scroll up there is 15 times that you sweared in chat on your members
honk - RumGuru Your proof isn't correct now. Didn't you realize that?
RumGuru - honk How it isnt correct lmao
honk - RumGuru Why the fuck you always ignore the fact that there was a reason?
RumGuru - honk You should be proffesional in your host, you are owner, no matter what you shouldnt swear at your members!!!!!!!!
honk - RumGuru Hmm let's see the tags:

Scammer - I already said that it was a joke multiple times, and you don't have any proof that I scammed. The fact that I just said „gimme a min” „im scamming a kid” „from 100 usd” and I didn't provide any image proof in DMs that I actually was doing that. It was so funny seeing you attach the image containing that lmfao.
Bad Services - MJCloud isn't a bad service. We have over 99% uptime, backups on an off-site storage server. Soon we might even provide 1 core of i9-9900K for free!
Illegal Activities &amp; Illegal Operations - I think this is about the no ToS &amp; PP thing, well you can still access the old ToS and PP. The new one will be released tomorrow or today, as I said before.
honk - RumGuru Wow, you aren't quite professional with the - let me count, 8 exclamation marks. And I am very professional in tickets.
RumGuru - honk You said it and then later after couple of hours you say "im joking"
Thats stupid why didnt you say "im joking" right after
How do i know that you are not lying?
 i never mentioned uptime or quality, i just said you are treating customers bad
 First that domain is not mjcloud domain, and you were working without tos for month
RumGuru - honk I said that you are not proffesional in your host, in other discords that you dont own do whatever you want: swear... and whatever you want
But in your host you should be proffesional, but how can you be proffesional if you are 9 lol
MythicalKitten - RumGuru minejaj.cloud is still owned by honk.
honk - RumGuru 

Yeah, that seems like a couple of hours - I just used your own proof against you. Congratulations.
If you're talking about scamming again with the „how do I know that you are not lying?”, how about you provide proof for it then, huh?
I'm treating most of the users good, only 1 of them was treated "bad" because he made me very mad, he didn't even understand it's a free host and he can't expect better quality than a paid host.
It is MJCloud's domain, before MJCloud was Minejaj Cloud, we just made it a little bit shorter and better. Not gonna lie, 'Minejaj' sounded more cringe than 'MJ'. I can provide proof that I own the minejaj.cloud domain. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-24/1621852391-706507-image.png

honk - RumGuru I am professional in tickets. How many times do I have to tell you this?
RumGuru - honk Ok i missed that i thought it was hours but it seems it wasnt, but its still same you said 10 minutes later that you are joking lmao
You treated more of them bad, and you get mad at everthying so yea
I never mentioned your quality of host so dont bring that here
Still why didnt you change docs to new domain hmm?
RumGuru - honk idk about that, you sweared at me and said that im dumb in one of tickets while i was talking to one user, but its lucky that i deleted that fast so he/she wouldnt see it
honk - RumGuru I was busy coding the bot, that's why I replied 10 minutes late, dummy. Alright, list all the people I treated bad here then. I didn't change the docs to the new domain, because I am fucking busy working on 6 things at the same time. It's fucking hard to update documentation, you know? (if I was gonna change the domain, I would have to make the screenshots up-to-date)
RumGuru - honk You never told anyone  where are documents located, thats on you.
You still said that you scammed someone and then you realised that it will get you in trouble so you said that you are joking, aslo coding bot that spams is also not a good thing
RumGuru - Also honk why are you mad that i made this thread, you literaly told me multiple times to make it so MJCloud would get "popular" lmao and then when i said that im gonna make it you were like:
"dude are you seriously gonna make a post about me on drama.gg lmao
are you literally gonna waste 10 minutes of time in your life just to write a pointless thread
bruh"
honk - RumGuru I edited the message a long time ago because the old ToS was incorrect. And you still do not fucking have proof that I scammed anyone.
And the bot doesn't break Discord's rate limits - only sends
honk - a message every 6 seconds and only DMs me.
honk - It was just for fun. I was bored.
RumGuru - honk i have fucking screenshot of you saying you scammed someone lmao, and also find me that message when you say you changed link and updated tos&amp;pp
honk - RumGuru - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-24/1621854041-795771-image.png
honk - RumGuru - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-24/1621854054-945569-image.png
honk - RumGuru HOW FUCKING MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT ME FUCKING SAYING THAT I „SCAMMED SOMEONE” AND THEN FUCKING ATTACHING A REAL SCREENSHOT OF MY SPAM BOT THAT WAS JUST FOR FUN AND SAYING THAT IT WAS A JOKE FUCKING PROOF, YOU DONT HAVE ANY SCREENSHOTS FROM ANY DMS OF THE „GUY” I SCAMMED OR SCREENSHOTS FROM PAYPAL OR SOMETHING. IM SAYING „GUY” BECAUSE I NEVER SCAMMED ANYONE.
RumGuru - honk yea he will say.that because he is staff and he doesnt want to get demoted lmao
honk - RumGuru dude... im not a fucking psycho like you
RumGuru - RumGuru read this again @honk
RumGuru - honk those screenshots prove different kid
honk - RumGuru „You still said that you scammed someone and then you realised that it will get you in trouble so you said that you are joking” ← this is dumb, why the fuck would I do that

„aslo coding bot that spams is also not a good thing”, I already responded to this - „And the bot doesn't break Discord's rate limits - only sends a message every 6 seconds and only DMs me. It was just for fun. I was bored.”. Also I responded to that too - „I edited the message a long time ago because the old ToS was incorrect.”
honk - RumGuru you dont have fucking real proof I scammed a guy
RumGuru - honk You scammed someone as you said and thats the only truth here idc if you were joking or not(you werent joking)
Also who tf would joke about scamming someone bruh
RumGuru - honk i do your words are proof lmao
You said that you scammed a guy lmao
RumGuru - Also screenshots on pc dont prove anthying because they can be edited
honk - RumGuru God you are more fucking dumb than anyone alive on earth. Yes, I surely scammed someone. Btw PayPal me 420 USD right now or you will fucking die thanks. (it's a joke, just saying because you are dumb and don't understand what is a joke and what is not). By the way, if I would really have earned 100 USD from that, MJCloud would already have a Ryzen 9 5950X node, my guy.

Why joke about scamming someone? Because you seem like a dumb person, and you actually are dumb. And it's fun to see you be fucking confused what the fuck is happening (when i said that „im scamming a kid”).
honk - *confused and like think „what the fuck is happening”
Cain - honk I'm not gonna lie, joking about scamming someone in the position you are in is very unprofessional and could potentially make you untrustworthy.

If I were you I'd actually make jokes that would not harm your reputation.
honk - Cain Well yeah joking about scamming someone might be not professional, but I already got a donator who donated 6 USD to MJCloud. He received the resources. So I'm not quite a scammer.
honk - It was before the thread was created here.
Cain - honk getting a donator and providing what they paid for doesn't make it any better. If you was in the position of one of your clients, and you heard that you are potentially a scammer how would you feel?
RumGuru - honk says a 9 year old/scammer/toxic
Lmao honk you should stop talking and accept the truth that you did all of this
honk - Cain I would feel quite neutral. I would not be happy, nor angry, or sad. I would just be kinda confused about what is happening and would do nothing lol.
RumGuru - Cain yes lmao he i saying "oh one guy bought a server and  i didnt scam him"
Wtf were you supposed to do man scam him?
Your brain is just so stupid
Oh wait i forgot you dont have one
@honk
honk - RumGuru ah yes time to give up and accept your lies. You never learn that I am not 9 years old. If I was I would have given up by now. I'm not a scammer, you don't have enough proof and I'm only toxic when you make me mad.
honk - RumGuru What do you fucking mean, it was like 1 day before the whole thread thing, YOU are stupid, look at your grammar.
RumGuru - honk omg do i need to repeat myself again
You are always toxic with or without me(example: toxic to your members)
And also yea now with time i am more sure that you are 9 year old and your messages show that, you swear to defend yourself and that isnt working
RumGuru - honk im on phone and its hard to type
RumGuru - And my grammar is fine
honk - RumGuru Bruh I'm gonna repeat myself again too now - I'm not fucking toxic all the time, do I fucking have to give you access to my account so that you can see all my DMs and when I was toxic?
Yeah actually I am 7 years old, wait sorry my bad 5 years old.
RumGuru - honk Also we almost forgot that you dm advertise lmao.
And sure you are probably 5 lol
honk - RumGuru We already talked about that, it wasn't me/it was a mistake. Plus it wasn't even my server, why the fuck would I advertise my competition? That doesn't make sense. And before you say: „because you don't have a brain”, I'm actually not lying bruh.
honk - RumGuru Yeah dude I am 5 years old.
RumGuru - honk so kid first scroll up and you will see screenshot of you dm advertising
I dont know why you dm advertise that server
Probably because you are a kid and stupid so you
RumGuru - RumGuru omg i  hate to type on phones
RumGuru - honk we all know that
honk - RumGuru Ah yes time to DM advertise my competition. I'm fucking tired of answering to your dumb posts every 1 minute.
RumGuru - honk wtf is that screenshot then stupid dumbass
honk - RumGuru Dude I am actually negative 3 years old, I'm about to be born in 3 years.
RumGuru - Honk you should go off discord and then come back when you get a brain
honk - RumGuru Yeah probably should, be right back I'm gonna go advertise MJCloud on Google Ads.
honk - honk Or whatever it was called
honk - I don't care about this thread anymore it doesn't make sense
RumGuru - honk it does make sense lmao 
Its confirmed and its true, i provided all proof people need so they can know what are you like
The best thing to do is apologise to everyone in thi thread and to people that you scammed/were toxic with!
honk - RumGuru I will never „apologise for scamming” someone. I could say sorry and give that guy some resources on my host, but this thread still doesn't make any sense anymore. I just hope it'll be resolved soon because I'm fucking tired of responding to your shitty posts here.
honk - By that guy I meant the ObsidianMC guy on my discord server so that he can enjoy his server being fast
honk - And I didn't scam anyone so I will never „apologise for scamming”
RumGuru - honk this thread is 100% true and you can see that in all those screenshots
honk - RumGuru Tomorrow most of it won't be true, you dumbass 🙂
RumGuru - honk you dont need to give him resources just apologise
honk - RumGuru Shut the fuck up smartass I don't care about your opinions I will do whatever I want
RumGuru - honk what about that guy that you were scamming while j was dming you lmao
honk - You fucking pussy
honk - RumGuru Yeah he is now called undefined aka doesn't exist you fucking ugh I'm tired of typing now
RumGuru - honk you cant go back time and fix this only thing you can fix is to apologise to everyone
RumGuru - honk nice defending yourself lmao
You are making yourself look even more bad then you already are
RumGuru - honk i mean ik you scammed someone, i just dont know who
RumGuru - honk lol
honk - RumGuru Go away bitch
honk - RumGuru I don't fucking care anymore I just want you to lose the precious time in your life on repeating the same thing over and over again
RumGuru - honk i wish your parents could see this
Their 9 year old swearing
They would be amazed
RumGuru - honk i see that you dont have life
You are probably on discord 24/7 playing fortnite lmao
honk - RumGuru I'm fucking negative 3 years old you bitch, stop lying.
RumGuru - honk sure
honk - RumGuru Dude I am a Fortnite sweat, 10 kills 1k deaths
honk - I don't even play Fortnite now, I last played it like 2 months ago and it was because I was so fucking bored I didn't have anything to play then I rage quitted lmao
honk - honk (I said the rage quit thing because I am negative 3 years old, just making you have more proof against me, no problem, also I have a brain because I'm aware of this)
RumGuru - honk You are digging yourself a big hole lmao
RumGuru - Everyone @honk is example of mind of a 9 year old lmao
honk - RumGuru Yeah because I am tired of this so I'm making you type more shit
RumGuru - honk i mean thats good
honk - RumGuru Yeah guys, but wait @RumGuru I'm below 9, can you please correct yourself? Thanks.
RumGuru - honk oh yea sorry
honk - RumGuru The worst part is that most of these things are lies.

RumGuru - honk how tf are they lies lmao i provided all the proof
So stop saying that
honk - manouel I don't know but he's fucking lying and I'm fucking weirded out that this thread has the confirmed tag.
RumGuru - manouel scroll up and read there is 2 screenshots

RumGuru - honk it has confirmed tag because its all proof

Daftscientist - sadly, all i can see here is @RumGuru being toxic and rude to honk :/

And why would they lock it?
honk - RumGuru 

And also fix your life
  
  What do you mean? Make me kill myself by fix your life? I can't fix it.
RumGuru - honk maybe get off discord, or be less toxic, and dont scam anyone and dont fight with people
honk - RumGuru 

Getting off Discord will probably make me more depressed, Discord is my only way to talk with people including my friends.
Will consider trying to be less toxic
I didn't scam anyone so skipping this
You started this fight but ok
RumGuru - honk i think discord will get you more depressed because of alll the hate but ok.
And you did scam.
honk - RumGuru I mean I can't talk with my IRL friends if I go off Discord then. I can't see them in person because of this whole shit pandemic thing
RumGuru - honk then hang out with your parents/relatives/brother/sister idk lmao
RumGuru - Lol - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-27/1622138615-48522-20210527-200225.jpg
NoboKik - RumGuru Discord doesn't disable accounts for harassment, they will only send you an e-mail saying that you should've block them or something like that
