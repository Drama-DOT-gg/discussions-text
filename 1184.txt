QloxX - hello drama.gg im the owner of qloxhost and most likely like all of you wanted ive shutdown qloxhost now i hope all of you are happy that it did cuz most of you just hated it, and its not cuz of free trials or any of that  bullshit it was cuz of my mental health and i will most likely never open qloxhost again.
Dviih - GG we did it bois
QloxX - Dviih i mean drama.gg rlly didnt cause this i just got tired of owning a host and keeping it open i mean it literally ruined my mental health
Aaron_ - QloxX I bet you got tired of carding and gcp suspending "your" vpses
QloxX - Aaron_ i stopped using gcp but aight believe what u wanna believe
Aaron_ - QloxX i stopped using gcp but aight believe what u wanna believe

Most of your nodes were from gcp wtf are you saying lmfao
Aarony - GGs congrats everyone lets party and I am sorry for your so called mental health Qlox
Aaron_ - Is this some kind of a way to leave qlox after the 1 month trial of gcp? ðŸ˜‚
QloxX - Aaron_ yes but i rlly didnt use gcp after that i just used hetzner
Dviih - QloxX If your host is in drama.gg that mean you do something illegal so who affected your mental health was yourself which did it and using free trial/carding for your host
QloxX - Dviih i see tons of hosts on here that rlly didnt do smthing ilegall
Aaron_ - QloxX Fight against them, Provide proof get it archived. If you can't then ðŸ¤·
Dviih - QloxX I can vouch if jerome made these threads
Jedrik - hello drama.gg im the owner of qloxhost ðŸ¤“
Thominek - finnaly lol this homophobic child is closing his free trial host
SkyAdmin - Dviih GG you came one step closer to become a lifeless idiot
SkyAdmin - Thominek When will you close your life?
Aaron_ - SkyAdmin ?
Shershah - Guys, Ik that u all are happy coz qlox closed his host but why you all bully him for his mental health? If you all can't support him in  his mental problems then don't make his mental health worst.
SkyAdmin - Shershah Well it will reopen, and this is good If you don't like the host just .... don't .. use ... it?
 ðŸ¤”
Aaron_ - SkyAdmin Its like unseeing someone doing massive amounts of fraud and not doing anything. Hard to not dramagg as a human.
SkyAdmin - Aaron_ 1th its not true, 2nd Why does everyone has to hurt him?
Aaron_ - SkyAdmin How is everyone hurting him again? Wasn't it him getting here in the first place?
Aaron_ - He is homophobic, does not know how to run a host, has know clue what the word professional means and really childish.
Thominek - Shershah i dont im happy that he closed his host i never bullied him or something also that when will u close ur life question is retarded
Two - love the fact people are still being toxic when they literally shut it down. (aka i don't like it)

give the kid some respect man. 

a ton of people came here because they were the idiot making the host...
if you can't confess your own sins (yes that word sounds kewl) in public before you make fun of others, you're a hypocrite and coward.
Chirag - awsamboi did anyone ask? does anyone care about some random ass hosts? nope right?
awsamboi - Chirag you took this serious ðŸ˜©
Thominek - awsamboi somehost? That hosting where people needs points  to pay to host their stuffs and if they wont have the ammout of required points ur things will be deleted? Lol

QloxX - i decided to reopen now before u throw ur toxicity at me again im trying to make it better, now most likely most of you wont give a shit and be toxic asf to me no matter what.
Aaron_ - Jacob The amount of times I got pinged on announcements for shit can't even be counted
SkyAdmin - QloxHost is reopening soon, we DO NOT use trial nodes lol.
Aaron_ - SkyAdmin DO NOT use trial nodes lol

Maybe provide some proof sometime
Thominek - QloxX oke then improve yourself too stop being racist and homophobic thats all
SkyAdmin - Aaron_ Don't you need my bankcard BTW
Aaron_ - SkyAdmin I need to see your invoices sir
Dviih - SkyAdmin GG another skid which suck qlox's balls lmao and now is crying to "mama" (which i fucked yesterday) and made a thread go back to your mother's pussy kid
awsamboi - Thominek Alright my  guy ðŸ™‚. Can you try opening a free hosting without getting any profit? Most of the hostings you see without A WAY to earn ANY profit are using free trials, but you didn't knew it, right? And the "things" are not getting deleted, they are getting SUSPENDED there is huge difference between "delete" and "suspend"
QloxXy - Dviih woowowowowowow OMG UR SO MEGA FUNNY OH GOOODOOOO MOM SUCK HAHAHAHAH

Thominek - Tato  That host sounds familiar isnt that redgate old name or smth i think i was staff at that hosting
Tato - SkyAdmin Sureeeeeeeee sarcasm
SkyAdmin - Tato Do you look like that ugly in real life as your profile picture?
DeadBush - SkyAdmin Atleast he has a profile picture unless you who is too insecure about his looks and hides it behind a terminal logo
Aaron_ - SkyAdmin Yo yo yo, Chill. Don't be a dick.
Tato - SkyAdmin Dang rude, sadly I'll have to tell you this; I know that whenever you look into a mirror, you vomit as you see yourself. So please, please, please, shut it because I don't care :3
SkyAdmin - Tato I don't recommend you looking into a mirror as it will break immediately, and the new mirror will cost more than your whole life.
SkyAdmin - Aaron_ Reverse.
SkyAdmin - DeadBush And what about you huh?
Tato - SkyAdmin Yeah, it'll break cus I'm super handsome
And lives don't cost so neither does yours kid
Shershah - SkyAdmin Go ask your mom about him.
Tato - Shershah He can't though. He has no mom, he's adopted
Shershah - Tato also this kid call himself as a nodeadmin and dont know what is sysadmin, and dont even know what is cmd to find particuler file in whole system( he said cmd is "cd" to find it then he said it is "ls") lmfao.
Aaron_ - Shershah cd and ls, ah yes. That's how you find a particular file in the whole system. Stop lying!!!!!
Shershah - Aaron_

Aaron_ - Shershah ðŸ˜”
