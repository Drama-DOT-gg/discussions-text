EmeraldMike - You have probably seen where all your open channels get a link promising free nitro or CSGO skins. Anyways there is a HUGE wave from them as of currently so avoid sussy links and try to warn people.
EmeraldMike - EmeraldMike These cause the account logged to post the link anywhere it can.
EmeraldMike - Side note it can show in DMs as well.
babyharpseal - Now it's also discord nitro phishing links btw
Cian - sus
your_normal_professional_idiot - just go to falix's discord and like every 30 min or so a phising link will pop up but will get instantly deleted bc blacklisted links but when they get new domains they are not blacklisted so they show up in the chat
