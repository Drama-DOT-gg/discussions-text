Rismose - Okay, so here is the thing. I was staff on a Minecraft server called MeleeCraft a while back (about a year ago), and today I got a random message from one of the servers members. He was mentioning my role as Developer back on MeeleCraft and asked if I wanted to get an invite to his server he was making.

And you all hear how that sounds. It sounds like he is either wanting me to help him out, or to "apply" (they had some google form thing, idk I never got to see it as it was closed), or inviting me as a Dev on their server. But to my surprise, this was a 15 year old, very immature owner that wasted my time for almost 2 hours of productive development time. I literally sat and waited for him to open the application to the point where I couldn't work normally, and here is our conversation.


At first he seemed like he was a real full fletched Owner that knew what he was doing. (there were 2 other owners and at least 2 managers on the server. I am guessing now afterwards he is not the one doing stuff. It is more likely he is just owner because he happens to be close friends with the other owners)


I left his server when I didn't get a response, and then he asked me to join back, and I was willing to give him a second chance. However he wasn't the brightest as he didn't even know what kind of message he sent to me when asking me to join the server that way.


Then he said he would finally give me the application link at about 7.40pm. However as you can see I waited for over an hour for him to even respond. And when he did, it sounded like I was to blame for pushing him. He made me wait for a full hour before blaming his internet, and saying he was hanging out with his family. He also asked why I "kept joining and leaving". I left twice. Once when he didn't respond in the start, and once when I had to wait for over an hour on him to respond. He also didn't really seem to understand that he was making a bad impression against me. He just shook it off and said "I didn't do nothing".


He then proceeded to even further try to "blame" me for not "wanting to support a 15 year old", to which I replied his age had nothing to do with it, and that I had tried to support and help him for over an hour to no avail. He then can't seem to keep up a normal conversation when he is the one to blame for the negativity and blocks me.

Thank you if you have read through everything, it means a lot. And If I were you, i'd stay far away from this server.

Rismose - Rismose Okay so I got some more info, he didn't block me, he just removed me as a friend, but then when he saw I posted this he came begging for me to take it down: - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-17/1626550858-543761-image.png
psto - I saw what I did and I'm very sorry for the way I acted towards you, for fishing members and all of that, I really am sorry for what I did, and my server "Affinity" We want our server to be very great and we don't want any reports at all and I want to let you know I'm sorry for wasting your time, sorry for responding late towards you, but that's all I have to say, and also I didn't block you, I didn't do anything.. I had kicked you from my server and you left MeleeCraft and I couldn't contact you because you weren't friends with me.. Also, I wanted to invite members and let players know that I was going to release my server very soon, and you were friends with the Owner on MeleeCraft.. so I thought it was okay for you to see it.. Also I was keeping a normal conversation but I was in a rush because I had to go do something..

So please, if you're reading this.. please delete it and I promise we won't have any issues or anything.
psto - Rismose Also, you don't have to expose the Direct Messages, at least I'm being nice when I say these things because I don't curse or nothing, so I'm just asking you to delete it please..
psto - Rismose Also, I didn't remove you as a friend because we were never friends on discord, we was in the same servers and that's how I contacted you, I never added you, we never had conversations so it's a misunderstanding.
Rismose - psto You didn't curse, but you were being extremely immature and disrespectful
psto - ""Then he said he would finally give me the application link at about 7.40pm. However as you can see I waited for over an hour for him to even respond. And when he did, it sounded like I was to blame for pushing him. He made me wait for a full hour before blaming his internet, and saying he was hanging out with his family. He also asked why I "kept joining and leaving". I left twice. Once when he didn't respond in the start, and once when I had to wait for over an hour on him to respond. He also didn't really seem to understand that he was making a bad impression against me. He just shook it off and said "I didn't do nothing".

Actually, me hanging out with my family is not an excuse, I had family over my house so that's not an excuse.. Also I didn't do anything.. All I said was it's gonna take a while because my internet went down for some minutes and it's not an excuse so can you please stop making assumptions.

Also I wasn't blaming you for anything and I didn't know I was making a "bad impression" off of you, I just wanted some help but you're being rude to me for absolutely no reason.. you're pushing the argument and the conversation and I'm just a teenager...
Rismose - psto Lmao you could have said you didn't have time, instead you left me hanging, sorry kid but I am not removing the post. I am not being any more rude than you have been, I am just sharing my side of a story where all I did was try to help you.
psto - Rismose Immature?? Disrespectful?? I didn't curse, didn't say any death threats or nothing, the whole conversation was chill, we didn't curse, fight or Voice Call.. so this conversation shouldn't even be an argument and also you blocked me after I tried to say sorry to you.
psto - Rismose And I get that, but I didn't mean to leave you hanging.. and I understand you were trying to help me and I wanted you to know that I'm sorry for what I did.. and you're not making this conversation better..
Rismose - psto Are you okay in the head? You don't have to curse or make threats to be disrespectful. You disrespected my time by leaving me to just wait indefinitely for you. That is disrespectful. And the way you spoke to me and how you ended the conversation was extremely immature.
psto - Rismose Also, the other owners aren't immature, if you say I'm immature.. That's cool you can say I'm immature I'll take the blame for my friends, team mates and more players.. but saying "Immature Owner(s)" they didn't do nothing.. I was in the wrong and I'm saying sorry towards you
psto - Rismose It was a misunderstanding how I tried to word things.. also I'm okay thanks for asking..

But, I wasn't disrespecting YOU in general.. I was saying "Why you keep leaving and joining back like damn" that was a misunderstanding, the "damn" part I'm sorry about that.. but it's no point of saying sorry if you're not going to accept me.
Rismose - psto I am just warning others because of a way a high positioned staff member handled a conversation with someone from outside the server. If you don't like the title, then so be it. I honestly could not care less
psto - Rismose Can you just unblock me and talk to me in Discord, so we won't have to type like Twitter people, because I just want to talk and tell you that I'm sorry.. like very sorry and I don't want Affinity being called a bad server.. Like please stop.
psto - Rismose See, you're being rude and I said please..
Rismose - psto The "damn" and me leaving and joining wasn't the disrespectful part, please read my message over again and you will see what I found to be disrespectful.
Rismose - psto But you're the one that made it look like it was
psto - Rismose that's why I said "it was a misunderstanding" that's why I said sorry
Rismose - psto Like I said, it isn't my intention to be rude, I am just telling you the same thing over and over because you won't listen, if you hadn't taken this conversation to drama.gg and just left the post to where it was you wouldn't have made such a big deal out of it. I am not the only one to blame for this conversation taking part right now.
psto - So, what can I do to make it up to you? I said I'm sorry a lot.
Rismose - psto And I get that you're sorry, but I have also apologized to your request to remove the thread, and I won't remove the thread. End of story, keep trying to argue if you want. I will ignore you from now on.
psto - Rismose Look, I'll say sorry again.. Very sorry for what I did.. I want you to know that and you're not going to take the post down which I completely understand, but can you please accept my apologies and we can move on in life so we won't have to keep arguing and I hope you have a good day
Fliqqa - this site wack 😛
