iiChxrlly_ - I decided to make this post due there a guy who made hosting, who uses google cloud platform which only alive for about a month. And admitted that this guy uses his mom credit cards. And client panel are WHMCS which people information like (Address, Phone Numbers, Emails, Real Names) are leaked and being used for registering to other host provider. This guy was raiding Nixxon discord server too.

Their sites:
Website | https://extrasrv.us
Panel | https://panel.extrasrv.us

Some screenshot that I have.




Their nodes location &amp; IP's:



This post is kinda related to Nixxon.xyz because this guy named "Extra" trying to merge to nixxon but its just cancelled, because they didn't plan to merge. And everyone got 150+ pings just for a ghost ping (ExtraSRV merging with Nixxon, then message deleted)

You can ask @Asharib for more information. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-31/1630426112-552980-unknown-1.png

Anony - I'd like to introduce myself as one of the main devs working on both Nixxon and ExtraSRV.

Unfortunately I cannot disclose more information than currently available but, isn't it suspicious that a random account starts posting negative information about ExtraSRV after a failed merger?
Anony - I'd also like to dispute the claim that all details are used to register to other hosting providers.

With ExtraSRV, we are still working on our WHMCS billing panel and, to be clear, never intended to ask for addresses and other personal info. It was unfortunately a side effect of using WHMCS. We've since made those fields optional, and always had an option to sign up with Google to avoid entering such information.
zenta4 - The discord of his host is from the 20 of August

iiChxrlly_ - lol the nixxon literally got raided last night, i wonder if its extrasrv..
SecretSecret - iiChxrlly_ it was it was Extra trying to raid the server, because they would not merge. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-09-01/1630510340-321589-b2284fea-05d6-4f4f-bca8-d27852ff0428.jpg
Wizzard - Okay so let's get started with the Google Servers. 
We can use what ever host that we want to use. If it works it works. There no problems with it.
  
Whmcs:
Whmcs was working perfectly fine. I was not collecting any phone numbers, address, emails and real names. We do not leak our client information if you read our terms of service.
  
  Raiding:
  Everyone is allowed to raid a discord server. They really deserved what they could get. Ash doesn't now how to manage anything without having me or his other manager running the nodes. To give you a example is that there was a night, that we had to pull a all nighter cause there fucking up there wings, dashboard and everything.  
    
    They just need to quit. You don't understand how much stress they put me into. Because I was the only staff on for 14 hours strait every day.
Wizzard - (How dumb they are, is all there SSH details got leaked and got changed and there trying to figure out whats wrong with the nodes. . (NOT BY ME)
Wizzard - @Jedrik  Hey, could you remove the thread please and thank you. Because this is joke thread.
Kowone - Wizzard jedrik no longer the moderator
Chirag - Wizzard Everyone is allowed to raid a discord server. They really deserved what they could get. Ash doesn't now how to manage anything without having me or his other manager running the nodes.

Yo, y'all wanna raid wizzard's server? Ever fucking heard about the discord tos?
Chirag - Wizzard We can use what ever host that we want to use. If it works it works. There no problems with it.

If you're using free trials, feel free to fuck off.

Wizzard Whmcs was working perfectly fine. I was not collecting any phone numbers, address, emails and real names. We do not leak our client information if you read our terms of service.

Yeah no, whmcs does that.
Wizzard - Chirag We disabled it.
Kowone - Wizzard disabled what
Wizzard - The WHMCS phone number login and stuff like that.
Kowone - Wizzard and why's that?
Anony - Kowone Because we were collecting unnecessary information. Usually the Google OAuth would've been our main login flow, but not many people used it, it seemed.
calcal - Wizzard raids are against discord tos fucking clown
Anony - calcal That is a valid point, but if you factor in the context of our actions, you would understand.

As a team, Extra and I have gone through numerous problems - we started ExtraSRV in the beginning to solve the management and professionality problems of Nixxon. For example, many of our all-nighters were to no avail, as management would just revert the config the next morning and then ping us with literally "WTF". I got tired as it got to the point where I was fixing the same things, every day.

After starting ExtraSRV, we wrote a proposal to Nixxon (don't want to share the DM here, as it would harm Nixxon too much). We agreed to merge, with only one of the admins disagreeing. The admins that agreed told us to proceed anyway with the merge, where we were allowed to change the name etc. Then, after spending a whole day setting up ExtraSRV, everything was reverted by the admin who had not agreed and we had lost all our work. This made us very mad, leading to the raid below.

We originally planned the raid as a joke, because of all the trouble we went through with management, and we very well know that it was against TOS, but we were past the breaking point.
calcal - Anony still against tos xoxo doesnt change shit
Anony - calcal Oh no, it's against TOS. I know that. I was never here to say what we did was right, but, you have to understand that we are human and act on impulse sometimes.
calcal - Anony bla bla bla still against tos
Asharib - After getting banned we don't need them any more they are joining with their alts and Arguing with staff members

Aaron_ - Wizzard Everyone is allowed to raid a discord server.

Yo, I better start raiding servers
KejiDiscord - Anony ethical or not, small or big, its still against tos
SecretSecret - Wizzard the point is you collected them are they still in your system most likely, you should not be needed to collect phone numbers also your told people to use fake details to login also a illegal action.
