Willypro7 - Hello! So today I came to an interesting hosting, 'ReleHost', they are Spanish, so some of you may not understand the messages, but I'll translate a bit.

This is my first thread, please don't hate if it is bad.

They have a privacy policy in website, but not a TOS, they have TOS at discord for any reason.

First, they sell FiveM servers, and that's illegal if you are not authorised. I even asked some people in drama.gg server to make sure I was right.

I've talking with the owners, and they were very nervous, saying that I would need to send a proof in 5 minutes or I would get banned. 



I sent the stuff, and the owner said that a FiveM "Expert" would talk to me. He did, and he limited to say that the TOS was saying that server owners cannot get benefit, not the host owners. I asked again and checked myself to make sure i was correct, and yeah I was.


They saying that server owners cannot get benefit

I've tried to make them understand that selling FiveM without consent was against the TOS, and they were saying no every time. I've spent a lot of time talking with em and they didn't wanted to fix their problems

He even said that point 7 (That basically says that server owner has the right to move the files and stuff like that) mean that you can sell FiveM servers.


They saying that point 7 means you can sell FiveM servers.

Also, I am not judging this part because I have no servers with them, but they sell 4gb ram for 1$, a bit sus.


Also, in the short time I was investigating them  (For about 5 days), main website, panel and everything went down a lot of times, and they didn't announce downtime or something like that.





And for any reason, almost everyone that left a review at the feedback channel left the server
And more, and they got also kinda bad reviews.

They have a rule that says no disrespect but at some point they ded in the ticket, i re-asked and said we already told you that it's legal, shut up, but in Spanish, they have no idea of what is legal and what isn't.

Personally i think it is a hobby, even when you buy they can say please wait some time, we are configuring panel, when i guess they should have everything configured when they open

And server is horribly made, just look at it, even a server with 4 channels looks better - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-06/1625608809-119957-fa0556fe-3be4-4359-8e1c-034e39404c43.png
