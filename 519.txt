SkepInBucket - Hello 
we all know Missile previously known as badsk, yes the guy who had over 16 hosts and still every single one of his hosts die after 20 days because all data was lost / corrupted. 

He made a new host Called NexHost, now lets start with the obvious they are operating without a tos and without a pp (privacy policy)

they have a total of two nodes as shown in the picture below : 

now everyone that knows hetzner can recognize the de1 specs its from hetzner cloud, and also anyone who has been in this community know that abusing hetzner cloud billing system is a thing, and some of us knows who does that : 

quick look on the owners oh yeah mike is one of them, mike is known of giving vpss from hetzner cloud that he doesnt pay for.

SkepInBucket - Got banned for hoaxing - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-19/1621429332-102149-image.png
bad - ok so
wat is it with the scammers, bad services, illegal activities tags?
i am not a scammer?
there are no servers on ur nex acc so how have u tested performance etc
   
i dont think a pp/tos is required when a service litterally has less than 100 users registered and before i say this, yes ik this isnt an excuse but uh the client theme is fucking temp as i didnt have time to make the new one lmao - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-19/1621431412-843468-image.png
bad - oh and im 13, u got my age wrong
Tomas - bad Incorrect, you are twelve, numbers and dates aren't adding up
abdullah - Does it really matter if he's 12 or 13 ðŸ¤£

@bad Stop abusing Hetzner it's ethically wrong, pay for your crap, and if you don't make enough money to afford it rethink your business strategy.
LordOlympia - bad well, you have a @bad  reputation. and no.3 is bullshit... you can get a lawsuit by it.
Vanquish - bad pretty sure you are a scammer and also, no matter how many users your service has you do need a privacy policy
bad - wut do u mean
Helio got to 3000 members with no pp/tos
Chirag - bad and it was a fucking shit host which shutdown as usual.
I found new ways to kill your hosts. Good luck.
Cain - bad just because you got 3k members doesn't make it perfectly ok
Puggo - That really does suck doesnâ€™t it.. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-21/1621592964-453596-86810679-4a85-42c6-9d4b-91c4e2d41779.png
Vanquish - bad that doesn't make it okay?
Ash777 - i just want to ask one thing 
why does even badsk want to make a host now ? to get attention ? like he got a legal notice i think that ico will take action against him or something and he just ignored like what he even wants ?
Ash777 - bad you literally got a lawsuit what else you want to get proofed before you get scammer and illegal activities tag ?
Ryan - SkepInBucket wtf no
