link, cp.fusiondev.xyz - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-15/1629037020-154525-capture.png
sus_person - also, The host is owned by the owner of Rapnode which got deleted
comfyy - sus_person Discord Link?
sus_person - use cp.fusiondev.xyz for that
sus_person - they posted their TOS now
comfyy - sus_person A  piece of advice, ALWAYS create a ticket or DM the owner first because many host owners like to improve their services. :)
TME - comfyy This is the kind of attitude that should be shown, not just try to shut down hosts by putting them on drama.gg, people start off with a lot of hope.
comfyy - TME Yep! Especially the SEO really messes up the host. btw @Sloth great job doing the SEO!
TME - comfyy Could u add me on discord
comfyy - TME ye sure. Username?
Scripted - Hey there,
We had a TOS, its was not there we had to do a discord revamp 2 times.

Robert - Scripted before we do that, could you please provide proof that you have indeed now made a ToS and/or privacy policy? Thanks.
Scripted - Robert Yeah.
