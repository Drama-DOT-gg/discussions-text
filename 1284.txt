Venomixal - I am a former support staff at Floofy Hosting, which is owned by abdullah.#0001, who has gotten involved in other drama before with other former staff.
For anyone asking which specific staff I am, I went by the staff name Syed. A for the most part of my employment with Floofy Hosting.
I'm extremely sorry if its messy and heavy to read, its 11.30pm where I am now.
My experience being staff at Floofy was not the greatest I'd say.
I've had my share of stupid moments, mess ups, and ignorance, to keep it fair.
Firstly they claim their support roles are paid roles, along with their developer role are paid.
However, throughout my time there, I made a grand total of 0 dollars and 0 cents, exception of them gifting me nitro classic once(worth like 5$.... and I was there for a few months). I had been "terminated" on false accusation grounds.

He never specifically mentioned what I had supposedly given this dude at all, and I presumed that a "nope" would suffice, lest he produced a specific log.

Then I got this message, and I just said ok, considering that I had been paid air throughout my time there. 

Ill just give one example of floofy's crap while I was working there , HAHAHAH imagine giving a client a refund even though he asked for it 4 TIMES.

There was also this policy for staff at Floofy, of which I am not sure if it is still valid today.
Basically I get free Minecraft Servers. 

I had made myself a few, as there was no obvious limit besides "dont overload the node!"
I had also given a server under my friend's account, of which I took down upon request from Abdullah.
My main server I had under their benefits for their employees had been joined by Abdullah, and he immediately started asking questions about who owns the server.... then proceeds to stop the server......? What......?
Do also note he had implied that I had done wrong by giving myself this server in spite of him clearly saying that I get free Minecraft servers as long as I'm with them. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-08/1638977107-526789-image.png

Iceey - Great thread, I can see how it was rushed by this is an example to go by, great work. 👍️ I have no comment on the company, I haven't used them myself, just wanted to comment on this not being a worthless thread like the usual on this forum.
Tomas - seems like a bit of a dick; although if their refund policy states no refunds under 48 hours then that's likely on the client - unless their service really is that shit
Venomixal - Tomas overallocated ryzen cpus lol, as a mod on drama.gg once said
AllSafe - Hello Venomixal,

When the company employ you, you will get an offer letter. The offer letter will state what you can get and what is your salary. You can use the offer letter to report the company at your local council and you should be able get back what you lost and what they promised, that's all we can help.

Best Regards,
AllSafe
Venomixal - AllSafe They did not give me any offer letter bruh
AllSafe - Hello Venomixal,

You should avoid company that didn't sign any contract nor provide any offer letter at all costs. You have no evidence on working with their company and they likely did not register you as their employee to their government. So technically, you are working voluntarily all this time.

Best Regards,
AllSafe
Venomixal - AllSafe ok thanks I guess... thats a dicked move nonetheless claiming they woulf pay... just wanted to give a heads up to everyone
I had to sign an NDA but ill just say they overallocate nodes aswell
IoNetty - Venomixal pretty sure you just broke your NDA, get ready to be sued
luffyy - IoNetty he wasn't paid and Abdullah claimed he paid his staff i doubt he's got cash to file a lawsuit
IoNetty - luffyy i was about to buy SG mc hosting from floofy, should I cancel?
Venomixal - IoNetty honestly speaking the services work when they work, fine.
but when something goes down the response to the problem isn't the fastest ever, but at least you get compensation. You don't have to worry about them withholding your files unless you are one of their bigger sources of income and you decide you want to leave
nonetheless still wont recommend as not very professional + not best performance due to overallocation
Venomixal - luffyy im literally halfway across the world from this dude HA, anyway considering he also has been clingy to clients who said they wanted to leave shows that he aint that rich
luffyy - IoNetty yes
Venomixal - Update: Floofy Management got in touch with me... still toxic, unprofessional, and denying everything inspite of proof. Called the thread fake and bullcrap.
The conversation is considerably long so ill be breaking it to chunks.

First screenshot, he asks me in DMs why I took him onto drama.gg, and that I did not do anything at the company and did not bother at all to do work. He's gonna be extremely ironic about this later. Then he proceeds to say another staff has been paid 200+ dollars, and he states they had financial troubles at the time they hired us. Okay, first big red flag. Why would you hire employees when your company is sinking.... whaaaaat? Theres a reason why people are retrenched when crap hits the fan, like COVID hitting certain industries hard.... and here we have Floofy hiring claiming they would pay even though they are barely surviving.

I bring this reasoning up to him, and he uses a really basic excuse. You can also note the last message, where he implies he will pay me, on the condition I take this drama.gg thread down. Basically bribery to censor the stuff.

He proceeds to add me into a group with management after that, and DIRECTLY ASKS what I want so I can take the thread down, as if the inference he did earlier was not clear enough. I give a blunt response of the facts. To give context basically he had joined MY public minecraft server, and then proceeded to pull such a dumb joke at 1am for me. He then said I could have banned him... he FULL WELL KNEW I WAS SLEEPING bruh

Before I continue I want to note that I was kicked off the group after typing this part of the story lol, so rest of screenshots are coming from my phone since I was outside and I had taken SSes of every part of our convo. Censorship much?


I was also asked the intentions of my thread, which I made clear. Most of the other messages are quite boring, except the last one... he said I would have gotten my pay if I had asked for it before I had left. Okay another major red flag. I was working there for months, my pay was supposed to arrive monthly anyway. Why would I have to ask for my pay? That's dumb...

Here's where he gets super ironic about my pay. He had stated earlier that I had not bothered to work, but now he was suddenly offering to pay me 50 dollars for the 3 months I actually gave the toots to work there. 

We then negotiated a pay sum, hoping that we could end this somewhat peacefully and maybe i'd tone down this thread, but he insisted I took this thread down completely to get my pay. I do know that shaming an employer would piss him/her off but I made this in the first place to make people aware of floofy's shenanigans because I was not getting paid. Heck if I did not bother with this thread he would not have bothered to offer to pay me. I reasoned that ill take the part about the nonpayment down since he would pay me, but the other stuff about unprofessionalism and having poor customer service stays up since that isn't fixed.

He emphasizes it again.... and so do I

First messages, dude from management busy correcting my mistakes in the thread.... welp acting like this to 4 customers is worse than acting like this to 1 LOL. Such audacity to admit. Then he claims a reason for termination was not mentioned, and that I was bending screenshots such that abdullah would look bad. I then ask him to mention the reason I was terminated since he apparently knows a reason that was never mentioned....

lo and presto, dude from management doesn't know this reason apparently, so how does he knows this reason exists, if it is even real and not made up?... I ask.... and no good answer! 
I'm extremely crude in the next screenshot because I was honestly tired that this was dragging out so long, so ill have to censor some stuff.

magically goes on to talk about how my evidence is fake again, literally right after I ask where he got this "reason I was not told I was terminated for". Yadda yadda yadda. Basically saying the same as earlier. Basically im "bending" screenshots to make abdullah look bad, mhm.

Basically, after all this happened, because abdullah basically wanted to pay me my months of work in turn of me keeping quiet and taking this thread down, I ended up with nothing, but more drama from Abdullah, and Management telling me my thread is nonsensical even though ive screenshots to prove my points. Funny. Now i'm also going to be "sued"" for breaking the NDA by telling the world his nodes are overallocated(welp they arent overallocated rn, but they have been set to allow overallocation by 4 or 5x to clarify.). Basically him and his management are doing anything they can to make me keep quiet. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-09/1639058369-49323-image.png

Most of the other messages are quite boring, except the last one... he said I would have gotten my pay if I had asked for it before I had left. Okay another major red flag. I was working there for months, my pay was supposed to arrive monthly anyway. Why would I have to ask for my pay? That's dumb...

Here's where he gets super ironic about my pay. He had stated earlier that I had not bothered to work, but now he was suddenly offering to pay me 50 dollars for the 3 months I actually gave the toots to work there. 

We then negotiated a pay sum, hoping that we could end this somewhat peacefully and maybe i'd tone down this thread, but he insisted I took this thread down completely to get my pay. I do know that shaming an employer would piss him/her off but I made this in the first place to make people aware of floofy's shenanigans because I was not getting paid. Heck if I did not bother with this thread he would not have bothered to offer to pay me. I reasoned that ill take the part about the nonpayment down since he would pay me, but the other stuff about unprofessionalism and having poor customer service stays up since that isn't fixed.

He emphasizes it again.... and so do I

First messages, dude from management busy correcting my mistakes in the thread.... welp acting like this to 4 customers is worse than acting like this to 1 LOL. Such audacity to admit. Then he claims a reason for termination was not mentioned, and that I was bending screenshots such that abdullah would look bad. I then ask him to mention the reason I was terminated since he apparently knows a reason that was never mentioned....

lo and presto, dude from management doesn't know this reason apparently, so how does he knows this reason exists, if it is even real and not made up?... I ask.... and no good answer! 
I'm extremely crude in the next screenshot because I was honestly tired that this was dragging out so long, so ill have to censor some stuff.

magically goes on to talk about how my evidence is fake again, literally right after I ask where he got this "reason I was not told I was terminated for". Yadda yadda yadda. Basically saying the same as earlier. Basically im "bending" screenshots to make abdullah look bad, mhm.

Basically, after all this happened, because abdullah basically wanted to pay me my months of work in turn of me keeping quiet and taking this thread down, I ended up with nothing, but more drama from Abdullah, and Management telling me my thread is nonsensical even though ive screenshots to prove my points. Funny. Now i'm also going to be "sued"" for breaking the NDA by telling the world his nodes are overallocated(welp they arent overallocated rn, but they have been set to allow overallocation by 4 or 5x to clarify.). Basically him and his management are doing anything they can to make me keep quiet. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-09/1639059796-326886-screenshot-20211209-212425-discord-beta.jpg
Venomixal - Update: Floofy Management got in touch with me... still toxic, unprofessional, and denying everything inspite of proof. Called the thread fake and bullcrap.
The conversation is considerably long so ill be breaking it to chunks.

First screenshot, he asks me in DMs why I took him onto drama.gg, and that I did not do anything at the company and did not bother at all to do work. He's gonna be extremely ironic about this later. Then he proceeds to say another staff has been paid 200+ dollars, and he states they had financial troubles at the time they hired us. Okay, first big red flag. Why would you hire employees when your company is sinking.... whaaaaat? Theres a reason why people are retrenched when crap hits the fan, like COVID hitting certain industries hard.... and here we have Floofy hiring claiming they would pay even though they are barely surviving.

I bring this reasoning up to him, and he uses a really basic excuse. You can also note the last message, where he implies he will pay me, on the condition I take this drama.gg thread down. Basically bribery to censor the stuff.

He proceeds to add me into a group with management after that, and DIRECTLY ASKS what I want so I can take the thread down, as if the inference he did earlier was not clear enough. I give a blunt response of the facts. To give context basically he had joined MY public minecraft server, and then proceeded to pull such a dumb joke at 1am for me. He then said I could have banned him... he FULL WELL KNEW I WAS SLEEPING bruh

Venomixal - Micro update:
sorry for bad formatting typed off phone in bef

realised floofy got 2 new support staff so I decided to have a normal convo with them, and before I left I decided to tell em goodluck and make sure abdullah actually pays you...
..

bam, muted for "spreading drama"... literally was having a convo with the new staff....

EDIT 2: 
I got banned for "toxicity", so am I causing drama or being toxic what, I was having a normal convo, I wasnt doing anything 
EDIT 2.5: 
hmph turns out that beloved management dude said I was spreading drama, abdullah himself then banned me for "toxicity"
nice work, ill probably see the new support campaigning against floofy with me soon anyway - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-11/1639197109-393948-screenshot-20211211-122951-discord-beta.jpg
