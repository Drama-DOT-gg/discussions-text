ShinyPlasm - Alright, so a bit of history. When BlizzardNode only had a US node, this dude (Zachary) approached me and asked if he'd like to partner. I said okay, and what are you offering and what do you expect from us? He said that it's free advertisement and he'd give plugins. 


I asked him to send the screenshots of him purchasing the plugins on spigot. He was unable to do so.


Anyways, time passes and he dm's me again. Basically he has a hosting company called SwithHosting and he plans on bringing Bot Hosting. So what he wanted to do was I provide him a VPS for bot hosting, and I get the profits. 

He literally sells VPS'es, why can't he use one of those VPS'es? Also "head of bot hosting", the fuck?

He also said that he's making a new website, and sent few screenshots.

I told him it was a theme from Envato (Was actually one from ColorLib)
He told me it wasn't a theme from Envato. 


I told him I'll have to discuss this with my staff members. I already wasn't keen on this, but wanted the best for BlizzardNode, so I considered it. 
I decided to not go ahead with his offers for the following reasons;
Lied about owning plugins, 
Lied about saying he made his own website
Staff also told me to not go ahead with this deal.

After I told him about this, he told me it was a theme from ColorLib

His excuse that it was customized. 
Anyways, I told him I wasn't going to argue about this, I unfriended him but my DM's were open so he managed to say the following.


Told me his plugins aren't leaked, but he was unable to provide proof that he owned the plugins.
He then said "i told you to answer with yes or no, i didint told you to tell me all these that doesnt make sense". (That sentence doesn't make sense :p)
Then randomly said the following, "just straight tell me you didint got clients so you had to respond with out of stock lmao" 
We (BlizzardNode) have over 4 clients, from just one service.. 
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/574481581197230092/740195938345287852/unknown.png

Anyways this dude shouldn't be selling hosting services, and in general you shouldn't deal with him.

Jedrik - I've been contacting him for invoices about the plugin he recently gave away,


It's been 2 days here's what I've gathered:
 His excuse is his friend bought it
   
His friend is magically always offline
  
He's always busy but has time to talk in other discords; thus ignoring me
  

Everytime I contacted him he was online; there has still been 0 proof of the legitimacy of this purchased plugin - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-08-04/1596552358-568479-image.png

ShinyPlasm - Okay so I didn't block him..
@AYS @Sloth Alright, you can add the confirmed tag.

@Jedrik Yeah, he has no proof for anything.. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-08-04/1596553541-292013-image.png
ShinyPlasm - And it continues. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-08-04/1596553932-321459-image.png
Popo - I know zach to well huh, scamming is my hobby in hypixel skyblock lol. 60 mil coins ez claps.
Jedrik - Was blocked and banned, probably doesn't own the plugin
RoseyMC - He did this to me also. Then i said no.
ifdoggothendoggopet - asked proof for resell abilities for cmi, my message was deleted.
Korudo - ShinyPlasm https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FmKue4WuagL8%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;f=1&amp;nofb=1 is the only thing i can say here

Edit: fixed the here
ShinyPlasm - Okay, I have much more to post.

Zachary is a 15 year old kid.


He is unable to verify his paypal account.

He asked one of his collegues to make a verified account for him.

He said he was going to verify his paypal account with his brothers credit card but never did because his brother said no.




Notice how the screenshots say "Error" from "Zachary". That's because he changed his username and tag so that people from winterhoax cannot find him.

His new username and # is Error#8189

He uses Contabo, HyeHosting &amp; Ghosty.Host for his VPS providers and ReviveNode for web hosting.



He also uses leaked add-ons and also received a report on it.



He doesn't want staff to post him on winterhoax in his chats.


Man was supposed to pay someone.



In the end he did pay the dude in full.

He also had staff members who DDoS'ed hetzner nodes in management team.


This was what was going on on one of his nodes for Minecraft.

I believe he now uses it for Bot Hosting - But this node is from Hetzner bought from a reseller so voice doesn't work and no where does he say voice doesn't work. 

He doesn't understand paypal fees


Was using Cracked WHMCS



Ok if this dude wants to delete messages, do it properly.


Uses leaked zeltux.


There's more on him, I just can't find it -.- 
Like he said "Microsoft Azure sells red hat not vps" but I can't find the screenshot - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-08-16/1597587934-749630-image.png

Zachary is a 15 year old kid.


He is unable to verify his paypal account.

He asked one of his collegues to make a verified account for him.

He said he was going to verify his paypal account with his brothers credit card but never did because his brother said no.




Notice how the screenshots say "Error" from "Zachary". That's because he changed his username and tag so that people from winterhoax cannot find him.

His new username and # is Error#8189

He uses Contabo, HyeHosting &amp; Ghosty.Host for his VPS providers and ReviveNode for web hosting.



He also uses leaked add-ons and also received a report on it.



He doesn't want staff to post him on winterhoax in his chats.


Man was supposed to pay someone.



In the end he did pay the dude in full.

He also had staff members who DDoS'ed hetzner nodes in management team.


This was what was going on on one of his nodes for Minecraft.

I believe he now uses it for Bot Hosting - But this node is from Hetzner bought from a reseller so voice doesn't work and no where does he say voice doesn't work. 

He doesn't understand paypal fees


Was using Cracked WHMCS



Ok if this dude wants to delete messages, do it properly.


Uses leaked zeltux.


There's more on him, I just can't find it -.-

Zachary - Hey! so thanks for posting this winterhoax. it really ruined my reputation. no worries, i dont know if this is gonna matter for others but i did do few things to improve my mistakes.

so as a first thing, i have removed all the leaked addons. we did not know it was leaked ones until we tried to upload it. this addons are not mine actually. our CMO gave it to us. he told me it was legally bought. he even said he spended 50$ i shouldn't have trusted him without any proof of purchase, but yeah i did ask for it after. but my question was ignored.  

Now, about illegal whmcs, well not anymore.. i have bought whmcs legally. 

about my staff member that DDoS'ed hetzner nodes.. man he had perms to do that. he was testing their ddos protection. also, he was demoted already. and being winterhoaxed is not the reason.

about my friend, real who gave you all those screenshots.. well  yeah i did pay him more than he needs to be paid. it was just a misunderstanding. i do not scam. specially if its a close friend.

yes, i dont understand paypal fees. i was new to paypal. also, my paypal is verified already.

About using leaked Zeltux.. well i have discussed with the CEO of zeltux and we recently did a deal.  

 

I do tell my clients about the bot not working in music. and on that screenshot, that is a trial node we got from a provider. and my staff sent you the image. nice way to put my company inside this tbh. 

about that screenshots of directleaks... i was only asking him if it was legit. i dont even have membership their.. 

and the rude talk with Real, the red hidden guy.. was a joke.. when sending him the payment, i even said that...

anyways thanks to @ShinyPlasm for posting these. that motivated me to not do anything bad in the future. also motivated me to not trust friends. :0 - https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/680128481706639368/744773585050140817/Screenshot_5.png

so as a first thing, i have removed all the leaked addons. we did not know it was leaked ones until we tried to upload it. this addons are not mine actually. our CMO gave it to us. he told me it was legally bought. he even said he spended 50$ i shouldn't have trusted him without any proof of purchase, but yeah i did ask for it after. but my question was ignored.  

Now, about illegal whmcs, well not anymore.. i have bought whmcs legally. 

about my staff member that DDoS'ed hetzner nodes.. man he had perms to do that. he was testing their ddos protection. also, he was demoted already. and being winterhoaxed is not the reason.

about my friend, real who gave you all those screenshots.. well  yeah i did pay him more than he needs to be paid. it was just a misunderstanding. i do not scam. specially if its a close friend.

yes, i dont understand paypal fees. i was new to paypal. also, my paypal is verified already.

About using leaked Zeltux.. well i have discussed with the CEO of zeltux and we recently did a deal.  

 

I do tell my clients about the bot not working in music. and on that screenshot, that is a trial node we got from a provider. and my staff sent you the image. nice way to put my company inside this tbh. 

about that screenshots of directleaks... i was only asking him if it was legit. i dont even have membership their.. 

and the rude talk with Real, the red hidden guy.. was a joke.. when sending him the payment, i even said that...

Jedrik - Zachary wE dIdNt KnOw It WaS LeAkEd
Zachary - Also, i will slowly buy all the plugins legally. ones i buy, ill keep sharing the proof. but i will not do any giveaways / drops for the plugins. and either wont share it to anyone.
Zachary - Jedrik we found out when ender told us.
Endermined - This was a private conversation. You did not have my consent to publish that screenshot. Very offended by your actions. That was still technically a matter within our abuse department and you, and such content should not  have been published.
Zachary - Endermined ._.
Jedrik - Zachary L
Jedrik -  - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-08-17/1597641949-745168-image.png
Endermined - It is a violation of our terms of service
RectroxNight - You are violation of there terms of service and there terms of service. https://gyazo.com/3a62bd3aef956715f385ca257894422f 


You can be suspended, in showing anymore emails and other private information.
RectroxNight - Even if I owned a scammy hosting company, atleast read there tos and private policy.
Zachary - RectroxNight uh i didint share any emails.
 i only shared it with my Co Owner
RectroxNight - I forgot to you broke this terms of service as well. If it was my choice I would suspend you.
https://gyazo.com/7efd31cffeea9c4fb0a620404471eab3
RectroxNight - Which against there tos.
Endermined - @RectroxNight We have been extremely lenient on this case subject. If there are any more terms of service violations, we will certainly be suspending the product.
Zachary - in that case, @Endermined you also broke terms of CortexNodes :/
RectroxNight - @Endermined  Yeah I know but I don't fill like he should use your services, because of what he did. Then not following the terms of service is one other thing I don't want to get into.
Zachary - everyone here is then breaking terms
RectroxNight - Then how are we breaking the terms of service? You didn't read his so that's why you are breaking his terms of service.
RectroxNight - If you admit to everything they would be off of your but way more. But your not admiting to it is why we are acting you so hard.
Endermined - @RectroxNight We treat all customers equally, no matter their background.

@Zachary I did not violate the cortexnodes terms of service. Please show where I did.
Zachary - RectroxNight i just did, sorry about that ig
RectroxNight - Were did you show that?
Jedrik - Zachary waaa waaaa - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-08-17/1597644462-646836-image.png
ShinyPlasm - Screenshots of the deal with zeltux is not available and is fake. I'm a support operator there and I can confirm the user hasn't purchased zeltux.
I also said "was" in my post about WHMCS.
ShinyPlasm - Also, you publicly posted the email about using cracked addons in a staff channel.
Methods of how I got this info will not be revealed.
Endermined - He doesn't have the basic debugging skills to run a host and just ends up blaming other people for his problems. Someone was bruteforcing him and this is what he said to us.

Absolutely ridiculous. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-08-17/1597680821-442383-image.png
Deleted User - Endermined Well yes, it's his own job to prevent themself from being attacked. It's not your fault that they got DDoSed in the first place, they blaming other for what happened to him lmao
Endermined - No. This isn't a ddos attack. It's a brute force. We never ever said we had any sort of brute force protection, and frankly, i've never come across a host that does.
Deleted User - Ooh, I see. Well, I've never saw a host that have brute force protection before.
Jen - Lmao, He's so unprepared its funny. He starts a host with no firewall software to block any attacks.
Its so funny ngl he tried blaming me for the Brute Force Attack
Zachary - uh yes, others say your a DDOSer @Jen  (i'm also not sure if that's true or not) anyways you had access to the nodes since you have been a part of our team ones. and your weird conversation with my Co Owner made me doubt even more.. (i will not share the screenshots, since i don't wanna make someone feel weird).  i'm very sorry. i know i shouldn't have blamed someone without a solid proof.  i'm still unsure who did the attack. at least we did setup a firewall and we're totally safe.

and yeah, i am new to this industry, i am learning slowly. with the help of my providers &amp; staff we did not face much complaints. all the clients are happy with our services. and i agree i do misbehave in some situations. and i already apologized about that. 

probably gonna learn debugging skills. since its my own job to prevent our company from being attacked.
Jen - @Zachary They are not odd because many people have offered to buy your company because you operate it so poorly, if you really deeply cared about its future hand it to someone who knows how to protect their VPS's with a good firewall for ddos protection, You should not start a host if your that bad at configuring a network setup for each VPS
Zachary - @Jen i at least aren't dumb enough to DDOS my own company &amp; get demoted, if i aren't managing it correctly, its supposed to be a mess but its not. and you would not like to buy it.. we're also winterhoaxed lmao. i might be new to operating the company, but im good at managing it.
Zachary - you guys might like wasting your time not minding your business, but that's pretty weird for me. i can be doing something better right now. i'll do something else, bye ;)
Jedrik - Zachary but im good at managing it.

Funniest joke I've heard in a while, gj mate
Endermined - Zachary Alright thats a bit far. He has our permission to do a penetration test, the reason he was demoted was because he had no evidence that it was our servers he was referring to (during that penetration test) and we just couldn't run the risk. Please don't assume things when you don't know the facts.
Zachary - sorry, didin't read the winterhoax before ._.
Jen - That's why I lost my job, Wasn't because I was bad staff. He just didn't want to run the risk
Endermined - Jen I can confirm this
ShinyPlasm - Fake LTD

@Zachary Where's the registration info? - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-08-19/1597820058-635433-image.png
ShinyPlasm - They removed the ltd from their name.
Deleted User - Putting a fake LTD at their discord name lmao. Anyone can do that 😂
Neon - ShinyPlasm Just a quick reply but I got the key from a reseller and palpatine forgot to verify it
Neon - Neon 
I got it verified: - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-08-19/1597842322-205453-image.png
deleted - StarLightz for free hosting that is possible, not for VPS.
deleted - Zachary i might be new to operating the company, but im good at managing it.

i'd like a share at ur company
deleted - my bad, shared, not free.
ThatHeek - 🤦‍♂️
HenryH - bump 🙂
Cheese - Funny thing is Zachary was involved in this cheating provider called Proxied.cc which was exposed by several people and also got taken down by the original coder who got accused of pasting. And in the end they all shut down because the original coder leaked their "self-coded" proxied.cc cheat. Funny thing is he can't do shit and even here you can see that he is begging people for something he claims he already has?
ZacharyPH - What are you talking about? What the hell is proxied.cc?
Plactrix - wut dis
Wild_TFS - BUMP
