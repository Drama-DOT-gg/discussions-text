In case this thread gets deleted, I'm going to put this thread in the Wayback Machine, because this thread is about drama.gg moderators, and how they are allowed to delete threads and ban people who "expose" them. 

I censored almost everyone's names. Some images have been provided by other people.

To skids and anyone else not involved: stfu don't reply to this thread if you're not part of it. I don't care if you know me in any way. if you aren't involved, don't reply. 



I'll state this thread is dedicated towards Sydney, and not drama.gg as a whole. Also, this thread is about one thing: Sydney has banned member(s) for reasons unspecified in the rules.

Sydney banned somebody from drama.gg, because he/she knew Sydney owned a porn site.

Sydney - Hey, just to point out a few things about this post. I do not delete threads about me, as I don't like to dictate that stuff. Additionally, I am 20 years old, I am allowed to own a site with NSFW content... am I not? My profile picture is cropped, so no harm done.

Additionally, when I ban someone for a rule violation, I point out exactly what rule I banned them for. I make very clear to Toki/Shady, the person you got the proof from.

Anyways, I won't reply to this thread again, have gud day!
LewisG - I personally think Sydney shouldn't be demoted because as she said, she's 20 therefore being able to own an NSFW website, also her profile picture is cropped and doesn't show any explicit content therefore I don't see why it would be an issue. I don't have any proof of Sydney deleting threads or stuff like that for "unspecified reasons" so that's just no comment.
Sydney - Sent this DM to Toki/Shady. Not that anyone cares lol. Just want to get it out there before he tries to twist it into something else.

To clarify, Toki/Shady was not banned bc he knew I owned a certain site. He was banned for alting, being incredibly rude, and ignorance of the rules. Alting alone is a ban, so don't come after me for him being rude lol. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-05-15/1684193203-546063-image.png
LewisG - i have reason to believe he's gone mentally insane - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-05-17/1684307805-597217-image.png
Young - Honestly speaking, if she isn't doing anything illegal (or advertising to minors) then she is fine.
This post is basically saying every person who started an Onlyfans are a pedophile. 

As for Shady, his feelings doesn't dictate other's opinions / discord profile pictures.

Also I thought everyone knew the pfp was from a porn site. Or is this news to everyone?
LewisG - Young its funny as shady was completely fine with me and how that i backed sydney on this thread hes starting acting transphobic, retarded and more towards me lmao
Justin - Owning an NSFW site isn't illegal. Sindey is not underdaged and has all rights to host it.
