Deleted User - I'm honestly quite surprised this host hasn't been shut down by law enforcement, as it hosts quite shady (and probably illegal sites) like doxbin.



Its even based within one of the five eyes countries which is even weirder considering these sites tend to either be hosted in Russia or behind DDoS Guard/Cloudflare. - https://cdn.riverside.rocks/a/stingray-hiss-trunk.png

BeepBeepImAJeep - The owners of ByteFend used to be super toxic to my friends and I when we were in the Agar Community, even hacking websites and DDOSING servers and people. They started Bytefend and seem to be doing all the same stuff here and I’m really disappointed. Limes is super egotistical and has doxed me and threatened my family before and knows people who can swat and they tried to do it to me but had an old address… please stay away from them because they’re dangerous and they’ve always been since the Agar days and will do whatever it takes to make people miserable. They don’t even use their real names on Bytefend, MrBot's real name is Felix and he’s a French-Canadian and has owned many Agar bot sites that people used to use. All of this along with the stolen website and codes just shows you couldn't trusting them now. Be safe everyone.

p.S I am posting under a pseudonym for fear of my families safetie
EdwardSnowde - Also Mr. Bot runs other things aswell, he made Bloxcrusher, aka free robux machine, witch is a crypto miner.

Bytefend - Hello. To anyone that sees this on Google just know that everything said above is fake, and is simply spread by our competitors. We do not DDoS, hack, or do anything like that. 

We are commonly impersonated by people because there jealous of what we have built. The github screenshots are also photoshopped by a frantech troll, we only deleted the github account because we saw no use for it if people are going to make fake screenshots and lie. 

Our trusted form of communication is our Discord Chat and twitter.

And we did not steal the theme, we paid someone to make it custom for us, please delete your commants as it's defamatory.
Soyabn9 - This commant is 100% legit. At least fix your fucking spelling. Please delete your commants lol.
FatGrizzly - Bytefend LMAO 😂 
I sent a github link, and people on drama.gg have screenshotted it :kek:.
Good Luck.
Our trusted form of communication is our Discord Chat and twitter.
 
So, this account is fake, confirmed.
Robert - @Bytefend Instead of flagging every single post on this thread please just look at the evidence (and a few allegations) that people have sent, and about the GitHub account, there is no evidence of ByteFend not owning that account. I do not see a reason to lock and/or delete this thread because of that.
Bytefend - Robert The posts violate our copyright. Respectively, please delete everything now. We do not want to have to get more legal stuff inolved over this. Everything here that was said about us is a lie.

People keep editing screenshots of the Github account. We only deleted it to stop people making more fake screenshots.

Robert - Bytefend I saw that GitHub issue with my own eyes lol, and what exactly about this thread violates your copyright? I saw that you flagged comfyy with "I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials on this web page is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. Signed on this day, the 9th of September 2021, Andy Bytefend", but we are not responsible what gets put on a different forum.
Bytefend - Robert He's linking to copyrighted material. He is not authorized to speak about our brand...
Bytefend - Robert You clearly have zero clue what you're talking about lmao. I'm just going to go to google and get the URL for this thread dislisted so nobody sees it. Thanks for wasting my time
Robert - Oh and Google also has a cached version of your GitHub account - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-09-07/1631044316-16529-afbeelding.png
Sydney - Bytefend Good luck. It takes about 7.9938 years for them to respond. And when they do, they will most likely say no, as it doesn't violate jack shit
Chirag - Bytefend We do not DDoS, hack, or do anything like that.

yeah, that explains drama.gg being ddos'd for the past 2 days.
Chirag - Sydney bytefend is trying to keep drama.gg down so google automatically removes it, which ain't gonna happen
Jerome - ItsYaBoyBanana If Cloudflare is able to bypass, what does Cloudflare does then? Cloudflare won't be $40 Billion company already lol
BaconHead - Bytefend So what's stopping them from just using inspect element or photoshop on different accounts to make it look like it's your account? You deleting your github acc doesn't make a single difference
Dviih - Hey @Bytefend did you just tried it in drama.gg? - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-09-10/1631284809-914682-screenshot-20210910-113917.png
7442 - Bytefend He's linking to copyrighted material. He is not authorized to speak about our brand...

I never knew copyright disallowed criticism of a brand.

I have been looking at both sides of this argument, you're not making yourself look good by trying to hide all criticisms. Why not respond with evidence against the claims rather than (attempting to) hide them?
7442 - xoraware salty about paste site + why didn't you say what you said in the discord here?

its sad how they believe a site that protects sites is going to ruin their rep on ddosing sites?

obviously ruining their reputation is not the aim as anyone with a functioning brain would see that they ddosed the sites behind the scenes, afterwards emailing the webmasters about their sites downtime due to a coincidental attack along with a convenient check-host.
sounds more like competitors trying to bring down bytefend

competitors? do you think we are all cloudflare, ddos-guard and fluxcdn shills? i wish they paid me to shit on terrible "protection" providers like bytefend but they unfortunately don't. elaborate on this i would love to hear more. - https://z.zz.fo/wbN4I.png
KejiDiscord - Bytefend LOL YOU LIKED YOUR OWN POST LMAO
KejiDiscord - Bytefend He is not authorized to speak about our brand...

Public criticism is allowed.
comfyy - Robert Yep. Sorry about that.

TrevorAS399748AS44258 - I do want to say, I was spam bombed by ByteFend a couple of days ago and today as well... I had to create a transport rule to block the massive amount of stuff that ByteFend sent my way to combat his BS.
7442 - TrevorAS399748AS44258 If you don't mind could you share those rules? I'd rather block shit they send before they actually do it.
Deleted User - L
Bytefend - xoraware we agree.

we are being attacked, we do not ddos or mail bomb. Please use common sense when replying to threads about us all you other people.
Chirag - Bytefend stop bombing my email, or I'll send the kids in my basement to your discord server.
FatGrizzly - @Bytefend  at this point, its kinda obvious that your just tryna hide the evidences.
and mind explaining why do you sign stuff as Andy when you are resigned?
Jamie_ - Soyabn9 At least fix your fucking spelling.



you are the type of person that makes me wanna delete everything and stay off the internet forever 💀 - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-09-22/1632327854-949619-image.png
Bytefend - Chirag  you didn’t even read my reply. WE ARENT EMAIL BOMBING IT IS NOT US.  But now since ur acting like such a child maybe we will because you deserve it after not reading what we said correctly
Jamie_ - Bytefend So what you are essentially saying is, there is someone posing as you that is email bombing others in your name, making a github account in your name, someone DDosing in your name and more? You haven't provided any proof nor have you replied to others proof. Pretty ironic if you ask me.
Bytefend - Jamie_ there is no proof. And people from frantech keep photoshopping fake screenshots of me. I’ve never used GitHub in my life.
Bytefend - Jamie_ can you stop being racist now? It’s not cool to be edgy in 2021, just because I don’t know English 100% doesn’t mean you can harass me. @Admin @Sloth please ban this person as they’re harassing people
Chirag - Bytefend @Jamie_ bully this dude more lmao
7442 - xoraware &gt;you sound like a cheeto munching nerd who watches hacking films all day

Very nice constructive reply, keep building your point... 🤣 

@Bytefend 

WE ARENT EMAIL BOMBING IT IS NOT US. But now since ur acting like such a child maybe we will
 
 mmm i love it when my mail bomber gains conciousness and decides to indecisively mail bomb someone.
ItsYaBoyBanana - Bytefend 

Bytefend there is no proof. And people from frantech keep photoshopping fake screenshots of me. I’ve never used GitHub in my life.

Bytefend - Chirag and what does this prove? Nothing. We did not DDoS franscio, no matter how much we may hate him. We only noticed his website is down so we tweeted at him to tell him so he can fix it 

@Sloth please ban these idiots because I honestly have no more time for this website.
ItsYaBoyBanana - mhmm yes - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-09-22/1632336350-647297-image.png
Chirag - Bytefend sloth probably ain't gonna ban anyone except you today retard. tbh, sloth's probably eating popcorn and watching the show lmfao
7442 - Bytefend 
We only noticed his website is down so we tweeted at him to tell him so he can fix it

I hate it when my site coincidentally goes offline from an attack whilst staff from a protection provider are strolling by and turn up in my inbox with a convenient check-host and statement that downtime could continue without their protection.

please ban these idiots because I honestly have no more time for this website.

you're free to leave the site whenever you want. no one is forcing you to stay here and defend your lies apart from yourself.

Jamie_ - Bytefend IM FUCKIGN SORRY WHAT 😆

RACIST!? You told people to spell right, and then you go ahead and spell it wrong yourself. And I am harassing people!? My 👏 Fucking 👏 Ass 👏
Jamie_ - 7442 I am most likely making a DDoS protection service soon for websites because of skids like this.
Jamie_ - Bytefend I highly doubt that sloth will ban me and the others from here because a DDoSer and dozer asked him to. But I mean if you really wanted, try with a kiss on the end next time and see if that works.
Jamie_ - Anyway, I’m leaving this conversation now. Say what you want but have a good one. Even you Bytefend.
Kowone - xoraware how does cloudflare has a relationship with buttfend?
Kowone - xoraware i swear people

won't that include yourself? also, this is a forum website, not an application
Kowone - xoraware what's wrong with it?
Kowone - also, how does being autistic has a relationship with buttfend?
Kowone - xoraware your mother? sorry but idk your mother. my bad
Kowone - xoraware sorry, i'm not an indian, you're bad at guessing, sheeesh
Kowone - xoraware sorry, but i'm not this guy, this guy's too popular, unlike both of us
xoraware - Kowone that i can agree with have a great day
Kowone - xoraware you too 👍️
Jamie_ - xoraware well if you really need to know, this is a really old PFP. A lot of people can confirm this. The fact you are bitching over a PFP is really sad. And who said I don’t have the knowledge? How would you know? Everything in my company has DDOS protection. VPSs use Path.net, game servers use hivelocity. And before I think you make any accusations about people’s appearance, weight or anything like that, you should take a good long hard look at yourself buddy, because the only one people are laughing at here is you. You brought this all upon yourself. Nobody else. You sent the Twitter messages even if you didn’t DDoS or email bomb. Grow up.
Jamie_ - I also like to think I have an good reputation here, more of a reason that I highly doubt I will be banned.
7442 - xoraware that's fundamentally different in almost every way.

btw i love how you went from "bytefend aren't doing that" to "cloudflare does it too!!"
Jamie_ - xoraware all you've said is you use third party ddos protections

So what? We get good ass protection from our providers and everyone is happy and not going down? No need for custom filteration.
7442 - xoraware i apologise that's my bad. i suppose in the future i should think more like you.

which hosts are we going to send ddos extortion threats tonight lads?
Deveroonie - hmmmmmmm
https://www.abuseipdb.com/check/193.31.15.1 (nice score there mate)
Jamie_ - xoraware they really don’t, your filters took may be amazing, I can’t say so myself because I have never used it, but it doesn’t mean you can just call other services bad because you don’t use them.
7442 - The best DDoS protection provider strikes again. I'm done now you've won me over 😆 - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-09-24/1632490033-759515-image.png
Jamie_ - xoraware reread what I said. I said that I don’t have experience with bytefends protection so it may well be as good as you said, I never said it has been bypassed. I said path.bet has not been bypassed and when it is, it always gets fixed within a matter of weeks.
Jamie_ - xoraware I am about to have a stroke from your responses, I quite literally said I have no experience with bytefend protection so it may well be as good as you say.
Jamie_ -  - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-09-24/1632498929-488256-837ec2ab-1cfc-4869-b763-b48cb7b973bb.jpg
7442 - xoraware I just wanted DDoS protection man.
BaconHead - Also, this mr bot guy used to run some invite for robux server too, called "Rebex" or something. The people in that were pretty unprofessional too. They kept pinging everyone all the time.
