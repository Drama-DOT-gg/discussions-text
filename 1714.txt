SpoonyTG - I'm Spoony The Former Main Owner After the merge with PvPSurf After their merge with Zanity Network, My Network. The Main Purpose of this post is to expose the owners and staff @ PvPSurf

Before I continue I am gonna provide testimonial's from people "Lukzn" has worked with on previous projects before me 



I have more screenshots saved on my PC, I apologize for getting these people involved who aren't even supposed to be involved here are screenshots from the owner of Polared.Club

I have a lot of other people I remember that testified but forgot their names and will get an ss when I'm free

There was also a deal where I had to take down the core I open-sourced that they used in order for them to stop spreading false info about me to other servers I worked with. and a announced he made also promised me if anyone kept harassing me from the staff team they'd be demoted which didn't happen with their admin (Avocery)



Later On I am asked to wait then when I join the server on a alt to check what was going on I read t his in chat 

I am clearing things up about the past and also gonna be opensourcing the pvpsurf for everyone to use ðŸ™‚

(Note: All Of our plans about merging were ingame and there is more to this but I am too lazy to get the screenshots rn and will be editing this later on today)

Enjoy!
