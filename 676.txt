EestiMngur - Soo i bought a theme from CatDev, blackkitten (ULTRA DOG) installed it, and now he refuses to give me assets folder, they delete all bad reviews and force us give good reviews.

mtt - He did have a reason, the partnership for getting the theme was a J4R and a small payment.
You ended part of the partnership and he deserves the right to revoke your theme since you broke the agreement.
EestiMngur - mtt i removed it at right time
Mitchell - ^^ (matt's right)
mtt - EestiMngur He mentioned it was until the 9th of June. It's the 6th

BlackCat - EestiMngur we wont scam you, breaking partnership deals will get your theme taken down
mtt - EestiMngur You are the only person complaining when you are the one who broke the partnership deal
EestiMngur - BlackCat ima just get another theme
EmeraldMike - Cat Dev isn't a scam. Tho what they sell is low quality. Same thing can be said for these theme dev servers. Looks at pterodev!
