Deleted User - __SECRET__ he claims that he abuses gcp free trial
colaaaa - ARKLO omg it's 2$! if ur that broke dont buy shit
__SECRET__ - Zachery u know we cannot call him a scammer or a free trial abuser until that trial is over or he cancels them and I don't think this works that well cuz he should get a free trial and it's from google and most of the people knows saying that we abuse free trials will give them popularity
dolphinandcat - bruh reselling paid stuff is ok but reselling free trials is stupid
WolfREK - ARKLO Its $2, you're crying over $2. Can't be that moneyless right?
