Using a discord bot for malicious intent against Ash's server


Clearing up

Eraters 
Ash decided once he got banned from a server that "Oh yeah! It's a good idea to have my bot nuke this server!" I'll have proof at the end. After that, I had one of my bots nuke his server as revenge, but it's even worse for the owner of the server Ash nuked, because this person had actually paid money for advertisement. His server only had like 20 members, but the one he nuked had over 100.

Ash
Now let me clear this up. I nuked his "friends" server who he knew for less than 1-2 days. i did it once i have one offence alright, note that. Now He claims my server had 20 when its around 50.


Basic Summary

After eraters claimed Ash had nuked his "friend's" server, eraters had used Korudo's bot to then nuke Ash's server along with e-bot

HCS - Add a confirmed tag to the one on ash as well, ash nuked a server with 100 members in and eraters got his revenge, don’t give it if you can’t take it, ash also claimed they didn’t care as well Ash tried to nuke my host. Eraters was well in the right to nuke (they lost  50 but the server ash nuked lost 100 and had a good active server that has now been ruined, if your gonna nuke a server don’t get mad when yours get nuked. Why is ash too scared to post this and getting someone else too, ash is an immature idiot who nukes servers when they get a bit angry (temper issues)
Jedrik - HCS Noted
Ash - @HCS Eraters could've nuked my 300 server but i kicked all bot leading to kourdo and eraters
eraters - I wouldn't do so. That would've been very unfair and unreasonable. I did 25 members from that discord, even though there were 50. I made sure that you did not screw over everything, though you decided all members should go. We still don't have all the members you had before, and the discord that I "nuked" could've fully recovered the 25 members it lost. You nuked 100 with $5 in ads. That is not equivalent to 25 in any way, shape, or form.
eraters - Now let me clear this up. I nuked his "friends" server who he knew for less than 1-2 days. i did it once i have one offence alright, note that. Now He claims my server had 20 when its around 50. I've actually known SAO and HCS longer than I knew you, because Korudo introduced us.
eraters - crap im bad at tpying
eraters - Using a discord bot for malicious intent against Ash's server You did the same.
eraters - Please explain your reasoning for nuking. @Ash
eraters - After eraters claimed Ash had nuked his "friend's" server, eraters had used Korudo's bot to then nuke Ash's server along with e-bot When E-Bot and Freezy merged, Korudo and I got ownership of BOTH bots.
Ash - eraters U kicked 40 there are  where some left which had higher perms than freezy. You kicked all u could. And I saw how much was left in amoung us. I kicked when it had about 105 members and at the end there were like 15 members left lmao. I also spent time on that discord with matt
Ash - @eraters cap idk about hcs but I knew sao before u he didnt even know u well.
eraters - Did you know: I was in there even after it. There was 1 bot, me, hcs, and SAO left. That's all that was there.
Ash - eraters u used kourdos bot i used my own
eraters - eraters After eraters claimed Ash had nuked his "friend's" server, eraters had used Korudo's bot to then nuke Ash's server along with e-bot When E-Bot and Freezy merged, Korudo and I got ownership of BOTH bots.

@Ash
Ash - well ok if kourdos says that is true. There are still 2 offences my g.
Ash - ill respond to other dm me when ur done with ur point
eraters - No. Explain why you nuked the server.
HCS - Ash Was not 15, a few staff and thats it
Ash - eraters Why do I have to ?
eraters - Adding on to HCS, there was only the people with * and **. Me, HCS, The Imposter bot and SAO
Ash - HCS it was like  15
eraters - Who told you this?
Ash - eraters I saw an invite of the server after it was nuked
HCS - eraters probs neon
Ash - Nope was not neon
HCS - Ash 
cap - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-10-01/1601581466-646087-image.png
eraters - That's actually impossible, ash. You know why? We banned you, meaning the invite would show "This user is banned from this guild", and no member count.
HCS - eraters even if they did it was probs after we did another @everyone
Ash - @eraters I like how you tried to make xxlandi leave meguchu. Please dont do tat again lmao. He is not leaving and niether are any staff all of them are informed so dw
eraters - Yep
Ash - eraters u can stilll see member but u cant join
eraters - No, That's not what happened. What happened is I told him he's done with E-Bot for working with ash, and he wanted more info. So I told him and he said he was gonna quit
HCS - Ash Doesnt matter, nuking a server and attempting to nuke my host all because you had a small fallout is childish
eraters - And no, you can't. I banned my alt to test this just now and guess what! You can't. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-10-01/1601581636-799280-image.png
Ash - ill ban u from a server u wills till be able to see the amount online and offline but not join that's where it blocks you
Ash - u tried joining LMAO
eraters - Nope. Sent myself an invite and it said that immediately for me.
eraters - Yet again, say why you nuked the server.
Ash - HCS sao was being a fucking bitch and he asked for a sorry so I gave it to him  as a sorry i forogot to create channel called [Im sorry Sao] :D
HCS - Ash Not really, You also tried to nuke cry as well so your reasoning is...
Ash - I ma be back in like 20 mins
eraters - Ash. SAO told me that you were getting on his nerves for constantly saying he had no idea what he was doing and that he was shit at coding. He told me that you continued to tell him that I had made the bot, which I did not.
Toki0179 - so why did you nuke the chat because I don't seem to see an answer yet.
eraters - https://cortexnodes.net/image/i/LNUWKxmQ.png I found why he nuked it
Neon - Jedrik To be honest, Ash is probably scared because he didnt make this himself.
EDIT: This was quoted to me by HCS in a groupchat.
Korudo - Ash I didn't know he nuked servers using my bot god everytime I get back to discord this happens.
Ash - Neon Tbh I asked jedrick cause i have no hoaxing experience.
Ash - Korudo yes I'm trying not to include you this hoax is aimed at eraters
Neon - Ash Bro. I really think your scared tbh.
Ash - Neon guess hcs is scared himself as he didnt say it
Korudo - This is just a shithole of a mess
Ash - Im not I tried righting one it was shit
Ash - bruh im getting spam emailied lmao
Korudo - Call me on disc im gonna tell u where to disable email notifs
Korudo - https://winterhoax.com/settings You can disable specefic email stuff
Neon - Ash I wanted to bring it up. Dont give a shit about HCS
Neon - Ash Lol. Doesnt look in settings to disable email notifs.
Ash - Damn we really went to dms
eraters - actually, you blocked me.
Jedrik - Resolved by eraters and Ash
