Raz3r12 - Hey guys so I bought a server logo from the discord user Developly#7159 and a website I got the logo but the website I did not get. I waited a while then proceeded to message developly I asked him when the website was gonna be ready so we started working on it then we got all the benefits done he then proceeds to say I will try to get the website setup and running then said I will try not to die for 2 weeks again because I asked for the website and he ignored me for 2 weeks then after that i gave him a week to get the website going. he still didn't do it so I messaged him and asked if he had my files for the website and he came back with my computer was messed up then I went to the developer that actually made it and asked if he had the files he said yes but the developer also didn't get paid for his work all because he was given two days to make a really nice website 2 days is by far not enough time to make a really good website. this dude thinks scamming people is gonna get him somewhere in life with his little scam of a business. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-03-18/1647647869-637429-scam.png
