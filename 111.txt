WhyMe - I once became staff on this discord server with the name of Jaguar network. The staff community is awful! They keep swearing at you and the Owner keeps threatening staff about DDoSing them if they dont work on the server. Everyone Watch out for this server!
SinisterSoul - This is very true. I reacently dm'd staff about how bad seek is and they all agreed but they didn't
 care bc they were getting paid.
Jedrik - Please provide any evidence you have to back up your claims
