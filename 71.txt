The owner admitted to using illegal activities to get free nodes lmao - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-09-09/1599610422-919932-unknown-46.png
Deleted User - I got banned from that shitty host, bc I spammed winterhoax discord invite on their discord lmao
Triassic - Just report them to Discord already.
Jedrik - This is the saddest way to get winterhoaxed
AYS - Abusing hetzner, dm advertising with bots, great.
eraters - can we make a new tag named like crappy everything or something in that manner
xCrystalz_ - I personally work for ByteSyze and yes, all these statements are true and I have already told the owner of ByteSyze to stop 1. DM Advertising &amp; 2. Using Illegal Nodes.

Im now the CTO with a new member of staff and we are working hard to fix these issues. Re-branding and restarting completely.
Iceey - xCrystalz_ What the fuck is an illegal node?
Jen - xCrystalz_ But you see the thing is, People will think its coming from a bias standpoint because you work for em, If you actually show dedicated improvements we will believe it.
Deleted User - Iceey 
Nodes they get from abusing hetzner bugs
Jen - Jeekie I agree, And that is super illegal, I'm surprised they have not noticed it
Iceey - Jeekie Oh dang
Deleted User - Jeekie iceey check this screenshot lol
xCrystalz_ - Jeekie I dont even know what has happened. Look, we are starting a fresh with this new merging with another host. Im gonna try and work my hardest to sort these issues out but we dont have enough money for all of these nodes. And thats not my problem but Im trying to sort things out one by one. Although you may think of me as byassed because I work for ByteSyze, I can assure you that very soon all our issues will be fixed.
Deleted User - xCrystalz_ 
I know you a tiny bit and you seem like a good guy, but the people you are working with are not and those are who I've made the winterhoax on.
Deleted User - You may say your trying to change stuff but it actually has to happen
xCrystalz_ - Jeekie Thats only Slayor. Im working things out rn. And im deleting all of our nodes rn off our panel and then kicking everything single member on our discord and we are starting a fresh.
Deleted User - xCrystalz_ I hope your giving your clients backups
Jen - xCrystalz_ Like we said, it would becoming from a bias standpoint cause you work for them, You need to show it then people will have more faith

xCrystalz_ - I have just shutdown all nodes &amp; servers. Now our host is not illegal and only the account for nodes is.
Deleted User - Have you given your clients backups....
xCrystalz_ - Jeekie Client servers only came up today fully and none of them had been touched. Because of this, they will not be getting backups.
Deleted User - Your host has commited illegal activities, but anyway let's forget that. You have to stop the DM advertising and hetzner abuse and show proof you've stopped it, and then we can believe you
Deleted User - xCrystalz_ some clients may of had files on there though
xCrystalz_ - Jeekie I dont use Hetzner. I dont use any of that. I dont do the DM Advertising. Thats all Slayor. Sorry but I have disabled the nodes from our panel and servers so that all illegal activity is off of our hosting
xCrystalz_ - Jeekie none had. Checked them
xCrystalz_ - ByteSyze is now officially down and we will be moving to PepeHost. Which is NOT run by Slayor and is a lot better system which will fix ALL of ByteSyze's issues and will not make us be on WinterHoax. And no, we aren't using Illegal Nodes on WinterHoax because someone else owns the nodes and they are not illegal.
Jen - xCrystalz_ Block me much
Iceey - xCrystalz_ Do you own the nodes?
xCrystalz_ - Jen  didnt block you?
Jen - @Iceey He doesn't
Jen - xCrystalz_ You did
Jen - xCrystalz_ Send me a friend request please
xCrystalz_ - Iceey I did not and that is someone else.
xCrystalz_ - Jen Thats because I left ByteSyze and we kicked all members sooo ye
Jen - xCrystalz_ Dang, Kinda a waste of a discord then
xCrystalz_ - Iceey this can be closed btw cos ByteSyze aint a thing anymore
WhyMe - Hello Everyone,
Jen - @WhyMe Hello! Scammer
Jen - Imagine owner of Byte Size @WhyMe
WhyMe - I am the owner of byte syze, I will tell you all the complete truth. The thing i told chicken is false information. Hetzner fixed the bug months ago and i had to pay for the vps's. i got jealous of falixnodes because i have proof of them hacking thousands of dollars of nodes from hetzner and selling them to people. i just don't have enough evidence to report them. All of those people who sent you DMs are NOT bots. they were my friends using other accounts and DM advertising. I am paying off the last 5 euros i owe hetzner and i am discontinuing this host. I am sorry everyone :(
Jen - @WhyMe Well Falixnodes is something not to ever copy
They are literally the name of illegal
They have been doing it for so long there's nothing good about them
itzawesome is really the root cause and he needs to fucking stop
WhyMe - I am thinking about doing this host again but im going to clear up all of the stuff i did. Next host NOBODY will get DM invites and every node will be fully LEGAL (even though last host all nodes were still legal).
Deleted User - WhyMe . i got jealous of falixnodes because i have proof of them hacking thousands of dollars of nodes from hetzner and selling them to people

Which happened a year ago and hasn't happened since
WhyMe - I am very sorry everyone for getting disturbed with DM invites and i hope you guys can forgive me because i am truly sorry
Deleted User - WhyMe . The thing i told chicken is false information

Why would you say it then
Deleted User - Jen They have been doing it for so long there's nothing good about them

Lol
WhyMe - Jeekie because i was jealous of falixnodes
Deleted User - WhyMe why where you jealous of a host that stopped those practices anyway
WhyMe - Jeekie because they get kike 500$ of free hacked 
servers and sell them for $250
WhyMe - then they do it over and over and over again
Deleted User - WhyMe they stopped that a year ago
WhyMe - no they didnt. they just said that and they are still doing it
Deleted User - WhyMe yes they did lmao
Deleted User - WhyMe show me any proof you have they are still abusing hetzner
WhyMe - did they give you links to an invoice?
Deleted User - Do you have proof they are abusing it?
WhyMe - a bit, but not enough to report them
Deleted User - Show me it then please
Jen - @Jeekie itzawesome is banned from hetzner and a bunch of others for fraudchecks and oustanding payments
However he's using someone else to make the account that way hetzner doesn't notice, Also itzawesome isn't paying for it someone else is, he calls it his quote on quote friend
Deleted User - Jen and all I'm saying is the current falix isn't abusing hetzner and if it is him to show me proof that it does
Pamar - Jen I am not banned from hetzner, I own account there.
deleted - Pamar can vouch.
J0SH - Why has this turned into everyone complaining about falixnodes, this winterhoax is about ByteSize lol
eraters - @WhyMe why dont you go ahead and take a look at the second and third comment in here
Chicken - Wow! Looks like ByteSyze is now back in business and bot DM Advertising everyone again!

Now DM Advertising even MORE people! 

I'm getting tons of reports in FalixNodes,



Hmm, seems familiar? 



WhyMe Next host NOBODY will get DM invites and every node will be fully LEGAL

Deleted User - I'm sure the owner just created tons of alts, just to DM Advertise people to join their shitty host.

WhyMe Next host NOBODY will get DM invites and every node will be fully LEGAL (even though last host all nodes were still legal).

Now this is a real way to lie. And let's see if he wants to reply to this thread and keep denying the fact that the person who DM Advertise (@WhyMe alts) people is not their account.
SimpSausage - Hello. I am Co-Ceo of ByteSyze. We are not dm advertising. Chicken is setting us up, trying to get Falix Nodes of the spotlight.
Jedrik - SimpSausage Provide proof
SimpSausage - How am I supposed to show we are not?
Jedrik - SimpSausage Well how did you pinpoint Chimken?
SimpSausage - He started this forum backup by showing screenshots of people dm advertising.
Jedrik - SimpSausage dang congrats on your big brain observation you've 100% confirmed it!1!1
AYS - Nope thats bullshit, dedicatedmc owner even sent proof of dm advertising, you clearly are
SimpSausage - We are not.
Jedrik - SimpSausage DANG MAN YOU REALLY PROVED YOUR CASE THERE! GOOD JOB! YOU CONTRIBUTED SO MUCH TO YOUR POINT!

You also have no ToS or privacy policy. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-10-11/1602429855-925431-image.png

SimpSausage - He doesn't own any sort of dm advertising accounts.
Chicken - SimpSausage Oh really? he's done this before, why not do it again? 

Look at all those DM Advertising accounts, who else would that be?
Deleted User - Just admit that you guys own some DM ads account. So, who you wanna blame for having that account? Devils? Gods? Ghosts? Huh?
Deleted User - You think you can lie us by lying? (Sorry, this is a joke, but it's kinda true)
Deleted User - what a great place to dm advertise
Prorok - I left a review on their discord saying that dm advertising is sad and that their nodes are trash and they simply deleted the review and later locked the channel. Cool

very cool, deleting bad reviews just so it seems like there are none - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-10-18/1603017385-320794-discordcanary-g5m0vjpy0h.png

Chicken - WhyMe You know what's happening.
NeilGamingYT - Chicken yea
abhithedev - well, hacking vps hosting provider is very illegal indirectly you are brute forcing into someones pc if they report you to cyber police you will be for sure end up in jail

Deleted User - Chicken Damn, they're too rich to do so. Every paid server has their own PRIVATE NODE? Legit richest person in the world.
Deleted User - They say that when they can't even afford 32gb node lmfao
Saqib - Their provider is probably google cloud, azure or something. Who would run a host with these insanley low specs?!
SinisterSoul - Heh Looks like they are rebranding. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-12-19/1608405413-234831-screen-shot-2020-12-19-at-21616-pm.png
ByteDev - ByteSyze is long gone, they're rebranded to SlayHost. And now I own it. None of this will happen again. Slayor left and so did 'Simp Sausage' or 'Angry Sausage'.
Yie - This name seems familiar - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-27/1624768612-780242-screenshot-2021-06-27-11-49-04-89.png
