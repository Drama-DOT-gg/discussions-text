KingRektYou - Intro 

Radon hosting is ran by a 15 year old, which he admitted himself. He started this ‘business’ last month, selling servers in discord pms, with no TOS, AUP or Priv Policy.

Theft 

From what i can now see, he’s proceeded to steal our own TOS, and changed the company name, he missed out a few bits though, it’s clear that the terms of service was copied, as it has our enjin website, and the date we made the terms of service on :facepalm:

Downtime

From what I can see (discord announcements made by the owner), the servers have been offline 6 times in the past month (August 31st - Present)

Reasons for this include

‘ may have accidentally turned the dedi off thinking it was my new one’
‘all servers will be going down within the next 5-10m I'm being as quick as I can’
‘ everyones servers are now down and i will keep you updated on when u can start them again’

Slow Support

I contracted their team regarding the TOS 3 days ago, and have not gotten a reply, they have also taken to banning people from their discord who are associated with my company, one of which was genuinely interested in their services, their company is made up of 2 support staff from what I can see.

Their (Copied) TOS

Jedrik - Now this is a well-written and informative thread
HCS - Shocks me how people would steal someone else’s TOS without their permission.
Ryder - unrelated but charge your device lmfao
KingRektYou - UPDATE


It may or may not be a coincidence that today we have been hit with a DDOS attack, one that is not normal for us.

I find this highly suspicious due to the fact that this is not normal for us, and the fact that the attach was initiated 7 mins after Radon refused to remove our terms of service, their reasoning for this was that they will remove it in 30 days. 

Screenshots of the attack - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-09-16/1600248787-319489-519e5aa9-5a0d-45e7-97d3-b362a2ea10a0.jpeg

HCS - KingRektYou I would take legal action if the attack resulted in damages for your host, I run my own host but I would never DDOS competition.
KingRektYou - Yeah, we are considering it, trying to get some proof that it was actually them.

Thing is though, they are like 15, which makes life a little bit more difficult
HCS - KingRektYou You can still take legal action against them if they commit a crime, I don’t know much about the laws in your country but in the UK people are responsible for crimes at the age of 10, age isn’t a thing that matters for me, if they are 12 or under ofc that’s bad Cus of TOS but it’s maturity, if they DDos you then they are immature.
deleted - KingRektYou my fellow windows 7 user :heart:
Marky73289 - hi guys i am marky whats your name i like this thread hi guys hi
Iceey - Most hosts that have a written TOS don't even follow it lmfao.
Iceey - Who made the TOS? and people don't need to have AUPs.
KingRektYou - @

Iceey 
The TOS was made by ourselves lmao
Iceey - KingRektYou I can't put a confirmed tag or anything on this until I am given sufficient proof that it's stolen.
KingRektYou - https://413.io/terms
Iceey - KingRektYou ... How do I know that it's not generated or even stolen itself?
KingRektYou - Check the date on their terms of service, 25th December 2019, their company wasn’t started until August, they also included skaia.website in the terms of service (not their website)

Iceey - What do skaia and Enjin prove?
KingRektYou - Skaia is a Minecraft server website, not even owned by Radon (owned by one of the owners of sys413)

Enjin has no relation to them, or their website.

Also, the owner
of radon has agreed to stop using this terms of service, and said he will remove it in a month - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-09-22/1600792036-190264-31c59c48-73b0-4e59-9bfe-cdd458a3229e.jpeg
