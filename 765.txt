LuckyTarget - Hi, I own a botlist website that is available for everyone in github. On this page I have DMCA so I know every time someone copies my website

Every day I get 10+ people that copy my page and don't give credits

I enter their servers, and I inform administrators that they must not change the footer.
I was telling them they should leave the credits but they said I was bothering them and they're not going to change it.,resulting after a few seconds of our conversation to make me Ban from the server. 

My botlist tooMy botlist template: https://github.com/Astra-Development/Discord-Bot-List

His website: https://botlist.dcdarkbot.xyz/
