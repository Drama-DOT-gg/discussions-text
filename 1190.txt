Aaron_ - I believe @Deveroonie is one of the staffs. Right?
Aaron_ - Also did you record your conversation with them?
Aaron_ - Oh wow
Aaron_ - afaik sqlite works fine
Aaron_ - SVR I remember seeing you in their server a few days ago.
Aaron_ - SVR got verified easily as the founder knows me - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-11-09/1636479664-313468-image.png
Aaron_ - SVR - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-11-09/1636479856-118675-image.png
Aaron_ - SVR Did you do that? - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-11-09/1636479934-737521-image.png
Aaron_ - SVR copied the whole bot source code.

How do you know they copied the source code?
Aaron_ - SVR Now they have my code, my IP

By creating a server on their host you automatically are sharing it with the founders
Aarony - I Agree
Aaron_ - SVR How do you know that
Aaron_ - SVR Are they ddosing you are something?
Aaron_ - SVR Abusing what?
Aaron_ - SVR what did they modify and you are giving them access to your things by creating an account
SVR - Aaron_ i did not accepted anything
Aaron_ - Its 100% your fault for trusting a host that does not have legal documents and uses free trial from linode
SVR - Aaron_ linode?
Aarony - Aaron_ 
Exactly
SVR - SVR They are a pure scam company then
Aaron_ - SVR By creating an account on ones service you give them the ability to access it automatically
SVR - Aaron_ They don't even have a tos or a privacy policy
Aaron_ - SVR And its your fault you used them without them having pp and tos
SVR - Aaron_ And they have the tos just on discord and it's a short text and is not legal
Aaron_ - SVR And again, its your fault for using them. They are not even open yet.
SVR - Aaron_ Ok but i want this company to get deleted for having no tos and pp and scamming people and deleting files without my perms
Aaron_ - SVR Weren't you the one wanting to host your bot there? I don't see anything that tells me they are already open
Aarony - I agree with Aaron with this one
Deveroonie - SVR They banned me just for asking for help

i believe the correct wording is annoying us + not googling it

SVR copied the whole bot source code.

nope. we do not have your code

SVR my IP

er... no?

SVR And in their server you have to be verified by a Founder to get access to it

yes, because the verification bot is not working for some reason

SVR They have it

nope. we don't

Aaron_ free trial from linode

i believe the other owner / founder pays 

Aaron_ does not have legal documents

we have a tos

SVR They don't even have a tos

we do, and a pp is in the works
SVR - Aaron_ And they are still operating without a tos and a pp
Deveroonie - SVR we have a tos and a pp is in the works
Aaron_ - Deveroonie i believe the other owner / founder pays
You sure bout that mate - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-11-09/1636480559-748282-image.png
Deveroonie - Aaron_ oh ok
Aaron_ - SVR Did they open their host up yet?
SVR - Deveroonie Show me your tos and pp and stop lying you have my ip you have it from pteradoctyl panel and you also have my files
Aaron_ - SVR - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-11-09/1636480609-495695-image.png
SVR - SVR Pteradoctyl panel is a insecure panel that can be abused by the owner
Aaron_ - SVR They just might not log ips? ðŸ¤·
Deveroonie - SVR you have my ip

if i do somewhere, i dont look at it, i dont think it is stored but idk

SVR Show me your tos

sure, https://kruos.cloud/terms/

SVR you also have my files

i erased them when i terminated your account
SVR - Deveroonie 1. This tos is incomplete lol and its not a legal tos
You have no privacy policy which is needed for a legal company
No cookie policy lol you can get a 500$ fine 
You erased my data without my conset
tenzfan - SVR Your right, pterodactyl owners CAN abuse, which is why you should look into a company before you buy from them. If you need reputable hosters check out novonode or diskos and avoid sketchy companies
Aaron_ - SVR 1. This tos is incomplete lol and its not a legal tos

They did state that its incomplete
Aarony - SVR 
He did say it is not open yet so most of the things could be incomplete
Deveroonie - SVR You have no privacy policy

i admit, it will be coming soon tho

SVR You erased my data without my conset

We reserve the rights to remove your user files from our servers at any time without any reason or prior notice to you.
SVR - Aaron_ Incomplete = no tos
SVR - Aarony And it's in "early access" and they have no legal documents
SVR - Deveroonie 
Then close your company until you have the tos, the privacy policy and the cookie policy.
If you don't then you will be getting a big fine and a company shutdown
Aarony - Dude can't you see, their host isn't even complete yet obviously there will be stuff which is to be done
SVR - Aarony Then why the website can be accessed and they have no cookie policy?
Deveroonie - SVR and they have no cookie policy?

we dont store cookies? + we are still IN DEVELOPMENT
Deveroonie - also SVR i believe your host has no tos and pp
SVR - Deveroonie Liar - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-11-09/1636481266-309229-image.png
SVR - Deveroonie but it is not even public so lol
SVR - SVR and i am closing it soon
Deveroonie - SVR oh wow... i cant access the websites code so dont nag me for it
Aaron_ - SVR What?
Aaron_ - SVR thats why its called early access...
SVR - Deveroonie But you are a "Founder"
Deveroonie - Deveroonie i can nvm
SVR - Deveroonie Then close your website until you have the legal things or get force closed (perm)
Deveroonie - SVR Then close your website until you have the legal things or get force closed (perm)

WE ARE EARLY ACCESS AND ARE STILL IN DEVELOPMENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
SVR - Deveroonie And what? The website is public
Deveroonie - SVR yep
SVR - Deveroonie So temp close it because you don't have the legal documents
Aarony - SVR 
Do you even understand what early access means
SVR - Aarony Where's the cookie policy for the website then?
Aarony - SVR 
How many times does this have to be repeated that it is still " to be done " And it is still in " early access"
SVR - Aarony Ok ok this topic is closed
Aarony - SVR yes
Deveroonie - TL;DR @SVR is annoyed that we deleted his acc. he made loads of false claims.

OUR PP AND CP IS IN THE WORKS!
Aaron_ - SVR That good to hear
Deveroonie - also, @SVR your host didnt have tos pp or even cp
SVR - Deveroonie because it's not even public now
SVR - Deveroonie I have other priorities like the client area for now
Deveroonie - SVR when it was public it didn't have it
Aaron_ - SVR Over legal documents? ðŸ˜‚
SVR - Deveroonie it was never public because the website was always down and now i am adding pp and tos today
_JustChill - I personally like beans and i agree with @Aaron_
Deveroonie - SVR it was up a lot more then it was down
Aarony - Yes
SVR - Deveroonie And?
Now it's closed
CharityLexus - was trying to find pp, why is this site hosted on repl 
i know it's mainly a bot host but come on - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-11-09/1636496136-618659-image.png
Aaron_ - CharityLexus y microsoft edge
Vdhx - CharityLexus our main site is being tested on we will transfer to our servers on release so thatâ€™s why
Two - just because its a host in the works doesnt give you permission to not have a privacy policy (tos isnt required but without a tos, you are essentially saying users can do wtf they want). 

if anything is released to even a couple of people, legal documents are required.

(when i mean anything, i literally mean it. for example, you need to license your code if you want to collaborate with anyone else or else no one will own it including you, even if you were the person who first started creating it.)
Two - SVR not necessarily true (not saying its false tho)
Two - SVR thats your fault for using them when you were aware of it.
CharityLexus - Aaron_ because i prefer it over chrome, so sue me lol
CharityLexus - Vdhx ok
Deveroonie - CharityLexus was trying to find pp, why is this site hosted on repl

endpoint: /privacy
XITENODES - Aaron_ nope i accutally doesn't same prmblem with my bot me using relpit for it now
