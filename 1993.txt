FzOrb - Hello people. Today I am going to be exposing the sandbox site "Bloxtoria".
For the people who don't know what a sandbox site is, it is basically a site inspired by the popular kids MMO Roblox. 
There are some good sandbox sites such as Polytoria, Brick Hill, and Cubash(Not released yet ðŸ˜›) but unfortunately many are absolute shit. Many use leaked sources, have crappy sources and have bad management.


For reference, Nate said that he has $1300. This is simply not true (yet).


This is Nate saying that he can't afford his frontend developer. If he cannot afford him, why would you hire Mapler?


This is Nate saying that he was 20.


Extremely bad grammar for a 20-year-old


Yet again he tried lying and regaining the community's trust

Sorry for the short post dramaturgs.

Mapler - I can confirm this information is true. I was one of the developers this user tried to scam.
