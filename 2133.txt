Demonix - Hello. Probably everyone knows it by now but I will say anyways.
My friends saw a host called PylexNodes. Today I saw an annoucement saying that ALL nodes are offline, this happend multiple times before and major downtime was happening every month.
So I decided to send a message "imagine abusing aws" and got banned few SECONDS after.
This is just a warn for anyone that uses Pylex or plans on doing so, be aware that they only earn off you watching ads and your data can always be lost (backup as often as you can if you really can't switch to a proper hosting)
MythicalDoggo - Who is still using drama.gg lamo imagin eusing drama.gg in 2023 its dead asf
Chirag - huh, says the one who made a thread in 2023, ironic ain't it?
Demonix - By the way, the host is most likely ran by Badsk. In the page footer it says that they also own heliactyl..
PinePlatforms - Demonix 

Our infrastructure has never had an outage affecting all nodes before
This is a 1 time thing &amp; we've nearly recovered

There will be no loss of data and only a temporary downtime

LewisG - ello'
LewisG - MythicalDoggo coming from the person that is clearly still using it ðŸ˜ƒ
Young - Demonix 

Tbh it really doesn't change anything.

Badsk has been warned about so many times in this community to a point where if you google "Badsk," you can find a drama.gg post ABOUT him 


If a person gets scammed by Badsk, the liability is all on the person who got scammed. They had a responsibility to do their research before working with a child on the internet lmao. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-04-15/1681518723-645649-image.png
Snyder - Not anymore, pylex go aquired by me, then i stepped down.
wolfy - Wolfy here.

Been owning Pylex since late April and I can confirm that this thread is not valid anymore.
Could this be closed? (I'd wish for it to be removed if possible).

Thanks!
