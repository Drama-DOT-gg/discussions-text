Itz_Me - So guys let me explain this fake shit! Ayaan the owner of night host is a big scammer reported in most of the servers. He keeps on deleting his accounts to not get caught. He had a fake hosting named guitar host which was using free trials like night host and fooling people. You can refer to this for more info: https://drama.gg/d/520-guitarhostxyz-using-free-trials-and-lying-to-their-customers Now after all his plans got failed he is with a new scam, That is Night Host. 

Things You Will Face (From my experiance):
1) You will loose your bot's files and he will say that is a technical issue! Once again you get fooled. What you can do is only cry, hes not gonna give you anything back.
2) Your bots or whatever you are hosting, the files gets leaked. He has many bots which he copied from his users.
3) High risk of privacy, as he logs all your data and passwords in a discord channel. (My friend was an moderator there before) which means all your datas including your IP will be exposed. 


He even forgot to change names lmao
