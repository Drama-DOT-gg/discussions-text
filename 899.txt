anonymous321 - Lets talk about "Kasper" and his so claimed non-profit organization; Swivro, the web hosting company SiteFold.co and HostwithGorilla.com

Starting off with Swivro, their website and their web presence (social media, medium, youtube, blogs) at first glance looks pretty darn good which honestly speaking they are but looks can be deceiving and in this case it is. I'm not talking services themselves but the CEO - "Kasper" is shady as fuck and I will provide some more proof to this claim as I proceed through this thread.

Firstly until a few days ago they used to claim on their website that they were a non profit organization and were basically committing tax fraud by accepting donations and payments for SiteFold, hostwithgorilla, I understand that these donations and payments may be required to run the basic infra but why promote yourself as a non profit then? You can still find the google search results of them claiming that they were a non profit as you can see in the below screenshots




I'm going to attach a few screenshots of conversation from the Blesta and r/webhosting Discord server as that basically explains most of the things that I meant to bring to all of Drama.gg visitor's attention and leave it up to your judgement. Oh and you can also see the extremely unprofessional behavior of the CEO in the professional conversations.








ah yes, your friend has spoken to his lawyer and confirmed its allowed. Just wait until I or someone else reports your organization to IRS and lets see how your friend's lawyer saves your ass. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-19/1629387021-531509-image.png

Notice how "Kasper" turns unprofessional and just tries to get away? Just your average summerhost trying skid trying to defend his host.




The above screenshot is from their official website but has now been removed

Oh and also this :joy:


calling someone "asshole" just because they were trying to help him

@Iceey you can have a good laugh at this privacy policy of theirs




 
 
Why should I trust this host? Because we assure you we assure you privacy :joy: 
That brings me to my next point about Swivro they also advertise saying that all their services are privacy friendly. How? No one knows and especially with such a shady and unprofessional CEO would highly recommend staying away from them, like they aren't even audited by a 3rd party security organization or a fair amount of testimonials to claim the same



Oh also Swivro, sitefold.co, hostwithgorilla.com offers support only for 4 hours, while almost all providers in the industry offer 24/7 so literally no reason to choose them as their privacy claims aren't validated and their support is for 4 hrs per day. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-19/1629388014-482045-image.png

Notice how "Kasper" turns unprofessional and just tries to get away? Just your average summerhost trying skid trying to defend his host.

Oh and also this :joy:


calling someone "asshole" just because they were trying to help him

@Iceey you can have a good laugh at this privacy policy of theirs

That brings me to my next point about Swivro they also advertise saying that all their services are privacy friendly. How? No one knows and especially with such a shady and unprofessional CEO would highly recommend staying away from them, like they aren't even audited by a 3rd party security organization or a fair amount of testimonials to claim the same

 oh and "Kasper" apparently influenced @Jen into creating some Winterhoax post on some host just because he though it was scam and he went ahead and did it 
 

Here's another BIG proof of why you shouldn't choose services offered by Kasper whether be it on Swivro, Sitefold.co or hostwithgorilla.com as they used stolen/servers without paying for them/got for free by some other person with no guarantee (I don't know if this is still the case now but you can see screenshots of his conversations below)


This was when Kasper used to run a Git client called GitPear as a part of Swivro on a VPS provided by @Jen and this happened 



He influenced some other teenager too into believing all his claims and saying his service is the best in various chat's or maybe its just his alt 😂 

I think the reviews about Swivro on google business is alt accounts too...not sure

It looks like he also used to run some other hosting company and closed it 


He also created a summerhost thread in the Blesta discord server when he himself runs one 😂 


I'll leave it off at this point since this thread is getting too long and no one except Kasper himself would be interested.

anonymous321 - exelen Sure just edited the posts although I wasn't able to edit title
didn't know he ran 2 hosts...

exelen - anonymous321 

I thought their first name was revetdev... And it was created in 2018 or 2019... And after he changed the name to swivro he said microsoft owned swivro. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-19/1629407612-929424-image.png
anonymous321 - exelen what an idiot he is
anonymous321 - exelen Oh okay, didn't know that although I do feel that name is familiar.

I certainly remember his bold claims of Swivro being owned by Microsoft though 😂 

At first he said Swivro was owned by Microsoft
Then he said Swivro was partnered with Microsoft
Then he said he works for Microsoft

all the while he was just a member in the microsoft community discord server without an employee role.

Just trying to find some screenshots for this
anonymous321 - Has anyone noticed this?

The credits for SiteFold logo is so small that its barely visible


They can't even properly credit/attribute the respective creators of their logo's or banners on Swivro, SiteFold and HostWithGorilla

they can't even build their own website while they claim to build privacy friendly software at swivro 💯

anonymous321 - exelen yeah, it looks like they were using this too without attribution
anonymous321 - AltusWebsites 

That is false, they do not commit tax fraud in any way. Here's why it was removed, because of the fact that it was causing confusion and causing more harm than good.
Fair enough, I was just attaching all the proof I had.

Alright, but this is Discord and he is only loosely representing his company. Here's the thing, we're not here to represent our companies just to chat and have fun.
I understand, but that specific conversation about non-profit organizations the members of that community were having was a professional one and even if you are not going to be professional at least acknowledge and take back the feedback whether you are going to implement it or not is secondary.

You have a point, that is overselling and their website needs to be reflected to show the same thing. However, this isn't as bad as you might think considering that the upstream provider also allows unlimited bandwidth.
That may be the case, but then why call out Contabo for overselling when you are doing the same thing, doesn't look right does it?

They absolutely are, the people in the r/WebHosting Discord server are beyond a doubt toxic. I gurentee, if you were to participate for a couple days you would agree.
I've been in the discord server for a few months and haven't noticed much drama or toxicity except in this case as well as other providers are blatantly self promoting themselves which in some sense is wrong because there are so many professional web hosting company staff out there that they are just trying to guide other people to choose a suitable web hosting provider for their needs and not self promoting themselves

That's another error, they offer support 24/7 via tickets in their billing panel. Personally, I would update that as fast as possible but he's a real person with a job and other things to do.
Fair enough

He's not, that is a message that was taken out of the proper context. Trust me here, we don't do business with racists and if we find out someone is then we cut ties with them.
Won't argue too much regarding this since you can clearly see the conversations what was happening...

Also what do you have to say about stolen code on swivro, "Kasper"'s bold claims of being an employee of microsoft or swivro being a owned/partner of microsoft, stolen/free servers from people with no guarantee, privacy friendly claims, attribution of Swivro, SiteFold, Hostwithgorilla logos or banner.
kasper6709 - exelen Hi, this was when I was first starting out Swivro (the freepik logo). I needed a logo to complete my website which at the time used WordPress. You have to understand, unlike most people on this forum, I'm not a child and I don't have unlimited free time. I have stuff to do &amp; places to be, I can't sit around for hours on hours &amp; days straight making my own logo, coding my entire website, etc, on a computer. I'm sorry to hear that you're not happy with my website.
In regards to what you said above, yes, I did change stuff on my website after screenshots were taken. I took the rather harsh advice and changed my website accordingly. Additionally, In no way am I evading taxes under any circumstance. I made that text larger on the Sitefold website as it appears you were not happy with it. If you have any more suggestions, I'm always open to hear them, but if you are going to give me suggestions in an impudent way, I won't appreciate that very much.
kasper6709 - anonymous321 I'm unsure what you're talking about, unless you are speaking of the time that I said Swivro was owned by Microsoft. Feel free to correct me.
"stolen/free servers from people with no guarantee" Please elaborate
"privacy friendly claims" Yes, I am passionate about online privacy and security.
"attribution of Swivro, SiteFold, Hostwithgorilla" As stated in my previous message, I've updated the attribution text on Sitefold.co to be larger as per your concern. On Swivro, it is located on the about page, and I didn't really manage the Hostwithgorilla website, so I apologize for that.
kasper6709 - anonymous321 I can list lots of things that you did, but I am too nice to do so. Again, I am just doing what I love doing. If you could leave me to it, I would really appreciate that. Let's both do what we want to do and not complain to each other (not saying this in a bad or rude way!) and be happy :-)
anonymous321 - kasper6709 "I can list lots of things that you did" what are you talking about?
anonymous321 - kasper6709 Yes, I am talking about the time where you said Swivro was owned by microsoft/you worked for microsoft

"stolen/free servers from people with no guarantee" Please elaborate

Already displayed in the screenshot which shows gitpear a product/service that was offered by Swivro and how the vps and all data on it got deleted

"privacy friendly claims" Yes, I am passionate about online privacy and security.

Not invalidating the claim, but have your products/services been audited by a 3rd party security company? Just being passionate about online privacy and security that you would be developing doesn't mean they are secure or privacy friendly since there may be other people or security agencies who are able to find flaws and many more non-privacy/security friendly parts in the software

"attribution of Swivro, SiteFold, Hostwithgorilla" As stated in my previous message, I've updated the attribution text on Sitefold.co to be larger as per your concern. On Swivro, it is located on the about page, and I didn't really manage the Hostwithgorilla website, so I apologize for that.

Good

I'm sorry to hear that you're not happy with my website.

Fair enough, but at least spend some time and effort in building a brand logo or banner for your hosting business
kasper6709 - anonymous321 Yes, it was a donated VPS and the owner turned out to be a child that didn't know what he was doing. Because of this, I don't accept VPS donations any more, hence why I purchased my own.
Swivro itself doesn't have too many funds, since it doesn't offer products itself that cost $$. This means I can't hire a crazy good 3rd party security company to audit the software, but I do the best I can to ensure it's secure, even when it's not my own software.
kasper6709 - anonymous321 Understood. When I'm free I'll look into creating a new logo.

kasper6709 - anonymous321 I'm unsure where the stolen code part is, please explain.
anonymous321 - AltusWebsites Anyways, do yourself a favor and stop trying to stir the pot. To put it simply, you have absolutely no right to criticize anyone but yourself. Additionally, I have concerns about your intentions starting this thread and who you really are.

Just trying to make a better internet and hosting industry 🤷
anonymous321 - kasper6709 well it looks like you sought FTP access for @exelen 's server and stole code
I don't have much information about this so it would be better for exelen to reply
kasper6709 - anonymous321 That is understandable, but I agree with what AltusWebsites said. It would be nice to just message me with your concerns or suggestions, I'm always open to hearing them :-)
kasper6709 - anonymous321 I would never steal code like that or at all. If I remember correctly, that was some joke/troll we were doing ages ago or something like that, hence my intentionally bad English in that screenshot.
anonymous321 - AltusWebsites Well I had noted that in the r/webhosting discord server positive and kind words wasn't working 🤷
anonymous321 - kasper6709 @exelen please clarify
anonymous321 - AltusWebsites 

To put it simply, you have absolutely no right to criticize anyone but yourself.

I certainly have freedom of speech

Additionally, I have concerns about your intentions starting this thread and who you really are.

Don't understand who you and "Kasper" are referring to
Tomas - I don't think Kasper got access to the server but I could be wrong, he just kept asking for it

The accusation that he was racist also seems far fetched (as said by Christopher)

Though, his intentions may have been to take the code as it seems Kasper can't actually code? Feel free to correct me
anonymous321 - @AltusWebsites I happened to go through the summerhost thread that "Kasper" created on the Blesta discord server since I hadn't fully read it and noticed a few more thing

You say you never assumed making the internet a better place consisted of trashing other companies and that I have no right to criticize anyone but myself.
You and Kasper still go ahead and do the contradictory as you can see in the below screenshots



I wouldn't say you are directly promoting SiteFold in this but why not help with the issue rather than trying to trash them? And especially this:

This certainly is trashing or criticizing a host, because even after the client himself says its resolved and clarifies that it was working earlier too but not remote email sending "Kasper" proceeds to say that "No they could not"
How do you know that it wasn't working when the client himself is mentioning it was through DA interface 

Coming back to the thread, you, "Kasper" and Aleksa seem criticizing and trashing companies, how do you justify that? It isn't even constructive criticism its blatant drama and jokes, so all I want to say is if you are criticizing something be ready to accept criticism yourself which clearly isn't happening because when Swivro/SiteFold was being criticize  in r/webhosting "Kasper" turned toxic and called them assholes.

I created this thread on Drama.gg because I clearly realized that you/Kasper were not capable of handling criticism professionally on discord and that I would probably be called an asshole or worse ignored if it did it there. Here you surely care about what I say because this thread would always be visible to everyone on the internet and directly affects SEO.

@kasper6709 You mention that this could thread content could have been resolved on discord and I stated my reason above but why couldn't you do it for the 3-4 hosts you are making jokes, criticising in the Blesta discord server? They also most likely would have probably appreciated constructive criticism and not petty drama or jokes

Its all fun and games unless you are openly criticized on a public internet forum is all I can say

My final verdict is still that Kasper and Swivro/SiteFold/HostWithGorilla is extremely shady and would not recommend anyone dealing with them - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-20/1629450891-409232-image.png

anonymous321 - @AltusWebsites I visited your website and noticed you are advertising your company as Altus Websites, LLC but was unable to find any official government records for the same can you please clarify if this LLC is real or is based on "Kasper"'s logic of being able to state a trademark when it really isn't trademarked 



I'm not very interested in petty drama though and this is not a thread about AltusWebsites so I'll pursue this further in the Blesta or r/webhosting discord server winterhost thread or your DM's. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-20/1629453426-831733-image.png

kasper6709 - anonymous321 An LLC is absolutely not a trademark, and yes, you can actively use/have a trademark without federally registering it. Both of our lawyers confirmed this. Google says so as well, and there is a thing called a common law trademark.

In regards to AltusWebsites, I believe he is just getting started and is going through the registration process.

It's pretty darn shady to have been selling web hosting not knowing that none of the users could send emails. Other than that, I see no problem with that hosting business and hope the best for them, they look pretty good and solid, and seem to know what they are doing, as this Email issue was resolved pretty fast. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-20/1629477140-14033-image.png
kasper6709 - Tomas As mentioned it was pretty much a troll if I remember correctly, I definitely was not literally trying to steal code, and even if I did, you could get it taken down.

Though, his intentions may have been to take the code as it seems Kasper can't actually code? Feel free to correct me

I don't know every programming language obviously. If I didn't have any knowledge in coding/programming whatsoever, how would I even know what to do? I never had any intentions to steal his code. It was also (practically) open source at the time as well.
kasper6709 - I honestly hope the best for everyone despite me making jokes or anything like that. Unless you are a literal scammer, you are ripping people off, or you simply don't know what you are doing, I hope the best for you, this includes everyone here :-)
exelen - anonymous321 I said he tried (and he tried in the past too)
kasper6709 - exelen I never did. Let's not lie.
I respect what you do though, and I think it's really cool, however, let's all just carry on doing our own thing as this doesn't seem to progress. I wish you great success with your business &amp; life and hope everything goes well 🙂
