hAcKeRmOn - So there is a guy named (Mr.Ace#9999) and he owns a discord server named Ace's Castle (discord.gg/acescastle). I used to be an admin on the server but I'm no longer an admin and I am banned from the server. Anyways, I used to be really good friends with Mr. Ace and I gave him access to my discord bot called Null (yes it was a bad name) because I was friends with him. But after I left Ace's Castle, Mr. Ace was mad and then started using my bot to scam people. He sent over 500 DMs to people in the servers that my bot was in. The thing is, I had given Mr. Ace ownership of the bot (which was very stupid) a couple of weeks ago because he said he was going to verify it on Discord for me, and I forgot this when I left his server. So he kicked me out of my own Discord team and used the bot to advertise his server in people DM's saying free discord nitro. And all these people thought it was me advertising the server and thought that I was a bad person. This happened a few months ago but I actually didn't even know he did this until a bot developer in his server that helped him told me yesterday. 

And the thing is, his server isn't even good and they scam discord nitro giveaways.

You can still see my bot Null on top.gg here (https://top.gg/bot/734192520996716556) but I think after Mr. Ace used it to spam on Discord servers, Discord noticed and took it down because you can no longer invite it.



Here are screenshots of proof:

At that time, the server vanity link was discord.gg/server, thats why its says a different server now.

Their server probably faked nitro giveaways:


He also nuked my server called Launchpad Development but he denied all of it and no one believes me. (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PlDm_HoOPu_OTQMoWOdHlrkAyKAroiT0p3HlYtwlOHY/edit) - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-15/1626346632-92696-image.png

Buffz - Why are you capping lmao. You're doing this to frame him you clown. First of all, you nuked his server, and Mr ace never nuked that launch server and even if he did HE OWNED IT fool. Your literally a 10 year old kid trying to frame someone right now.
Buffz - Buffz Can you remind me how many members you banned with your bot. It was over 3 thousand I'm pretty sure. Also he doesn't scam because last I remember he uses giveaway bot.
hAcKeRmOn - I'm not 10 years ago, I'm 13. Mr. Ace did nuke launchpad idiot and I provided proof in the document below.
Buffz - hAcKeRmOn I'm sorry. I meant to say 12 since your brother even said you are.
hAcKeRmOn - Buffz OMG MY BROTHER SAID I'M 12 SO I HAVE TO BE 12
Buffz - hAcKeRmOn how is the image proof though. The launchpad ticket banned members. That literally could've been you trying to frame ace for the 50th time. For the other image, discord bot clients are allowed on private bots, ive even had many discord bot devs and discord partners verify this for me, its only verified/public bots that its not allowed on.
Also that is more than enough proof that you are 12.
Buffz - Buffz Also its crazy how you admitted it yourself that you are 12 after you nuked Mr aces server.
hAcKeRmOn - Buffz What, when? I was always 13. and I don't think it's a coincidence that a discord bot client appeared in Mr. Ace's projects around the same time the bot nuked.
hAcKeRmOn - Mr. Ace is great at manipulating people and he has so many people under his control. He is a control freak and he likes and loves control of people's lives and what they do. He demotes mods and bans people just because they are friends with me on Discord or because they allow me in their servers.
Ace - bruh? no... ofc im gonna have a person who nuked my server be unfriended by all of my staff members... any person with a brain would do that
hAcKeRmOn - He banned my friend from his server because they were in my server.

He even made an entire ticket about it. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-15/1626390190-713195-image.png
hAcKeRmOn - It's not only mods, its everyone.
Ace - oh wow! im so sorry for telling people to chose you, a raider, nuker, and ip and token grabber, or be in aces castle, where u literally nuked the server, so use ur brain idiot
Ace - its fucking common sense
Buffz - hAcKeRmOn Yea no shit my guy. I would do the same thing if the friends of the people that nuked my server are literally in the server. Friends can do a lot you know.
Ace - if a server gets raided, and the owner tells people to unfriend the raider/nuker, that is completely fine, that is what he/she should do, use ur brain mate
hAcKeRmOn - a raider, nuker, and ip and token grabber

oh cool you just described yourself in one sentence
hAcKeRmOn - and you keep using "I nuked your server" as an excuse when I didn't nuke your server. You literally nuked my server AND you nuked my bot. You mass advertised your scam server with my bot to gain more members.
Buffz - hAcKeRmOn First of all you don't have significant proof he did. All I see in the image is launch tickets banning members. That could've been you not him. Ace has soo much proof you nuked his server while you have little to no proof.
Buffz - Buffz This will be my last reply because I don't wanna argue with underaged 12 year old kids.
hAcKeRmOn - I am 13, stop saying I am underage when I had clearly stated multiple times that I am 13.
hAcKeRmOn - Buffz And you must be blind if you don't see the image of Mr. Ace's account on replit.com (which is a site to run programs) which had a discord bot client.

He used the discord bot client to login into my bot and then banned everyone from the bot.
Ace - Ok idiot
hAcKeRmOn - So thats all you have to say? 

Ok idiot

You nuked my server, used my bot to mass DM advertise and all you have to say is "Ok idiot"
Ace - I didn't nuke ur server
and I didn't use ur bot to mass dm ad
I don't even own ur bot
I don't even know how to mass dm
and that's really unethical...
Ace - but Ok idiot
hAcKeRmOn - Ace 

1: Yes because you transferred it to someone else after you used it to mass DM users.
2: You asked that developer to generate code to help you
InXsar - I am a good boy
