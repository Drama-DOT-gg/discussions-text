HannsDeDestructa - Hello, so today i'm exposing another hosting service from a 13 year old.
Basically he started his host a few weeks ago, and before that he had a company that his dad registered for him, he had so many projects which he abandoned after 2 hours/1 day. 
He's also selling sepa ibans to people for 5 pounds. I'll post all proofs below.
He also got terminated on PayPal for scamming and then he immediately made a new account.
Abusing hetzner via ibans, shown only 1 part of invoices because the other half "had his personal info" which is obviously not true as he's literally selling bins. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-12-19/1671460480-622452-screenshot-6.png
