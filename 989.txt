Here's a response from luffy @ ArkNodes.com
Hostily was recently sold to Sourcream by ThatHeek due to reasons that will not be publicly disclosed.

ThatHeek had purchased his dedicated server from an individual named Jeekie, The dedicated server was purchased from hetzner the deal that Jeekie had with ThatHeek was that that cheek paid a little extra than what hetzner charged but does not pay for the setup fees due to this the dedicated servers were under Jeekie's account, Jeekie had left discord causing the dedicated server to fall under Ethan's hands ThatHeek was unable to pay Ethan the invoice causing the termination of hostily's dedicated server. people no longer liked hostily due to the data loss Sourcream didn't have much he could do due to a very tarnished reputation. what would this mean for hostily's customers? ThatHeek has all the money that you had paid for the service it would be up to him to refund you.
Triassic - cool
OresSilverRL - How would I go about asking for this refund
luffyy - Dm ThatHeek
lucaiscool - why are you asking that in a drama.gg thread lmao
OresSilverRL - luffyy I don't share any discord servers with him or cant find him
Michiel - OresSilverRL His discord is ThatHeek#5238
