Mad - Mitchell F Johnson, and I were sharing my Hetzner Account. He was going to help me pay my server, and he needed to order dedicated servers on Hetzner, and he gave me his bank details , so I thought he was legit. I made him promise that he wouldn't touch any other servers besides the one he ordered. The first invoice (with all of his servers and my servers) totaled up to 195 euros. The day the invoice was due, he sent my friend this DM, 
 I got scared and I confronted him, I did not want to lose my hosting, I've been working on it for over 4 months, and I did not want to lose it. I asked him subtly without telling him that my friend sent that screenshot. 
 
  He continues to talk:
    
(censoring someones name, he doesn't want to be mentioned). And then he says that it was a prank: 
 And that he will expose the person who exposed him on drama.gg. I don't get it, drama.gg isn't that big of a deal, he takes drama.gg way to seriously. After I give him another chance, the invoice seemed to get paid.  But about 4 days later, I get this:  
It didn't pay, which means that either Mitchell provided me with fake a IBAN. The next day, I get an email saying that my email was removed from the hetzner account, and he makes a fake email to impersonate my friend, (the one who doesn't want to be mentioned). He blames everything on my friend.
 
And he says this: 

 He removed my email, so I asked him if he did. And he said that my friend did, and he gave access to my hetzner account to my friend because he was "sleepy", and make him pay it and do the work for him. I ask him for a screenshot of his email, saying that his email was removed, and he sends me this:
 
  He gives me an email of my friends name, but its a fake email. Its my friends name with a bunch of random numbers. This means that he created a fake email, to impersonate my friend. I ask my friend if its his email, and he sends me proof of his actual email, and confirm that Mitchell sent a fake email to me. He then says that it was him, and he had ordered his dedicated servers for his hosting he was working on, and I was helping him. We were going to be partners in a way, but then he says, "Blurple Host was only an operation to get your hetzner account and delete it." I convince him to give my hetzner account back. Somehow he did. But he ordered 2 dedicated servers on my account, so I'm left with a 195 euro bill, and I cannot pay that, I only have money for my own server. He says he cannot pay it, his "parents" wont allow him. 17 year old, and can't even use his own money. My only chance is that hetzner accepts my cancellation, and changes the invoice to my servers invoice. @Mitchell #0002 did all this, he ruined everything, he's lied to me, made fake accounts impersonating my friend, he threatens me to put me on drama.gg (though I don't know what he'll put, I do everything legit, all my accounts are under my dads name, and all of my money goes to his bank. I do everything with his consent.), he tries to blackmail me, he can't keep his promises. If hetzner does not change the invoice price, I will have to cancel my hosting. I will be so depressed, if that happens, I have worked over 4 months on it. I am writing this thread so no one else will get in contact with him and get a similar experience as I did. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-19/1624085499-984506-image.png

I am writing this thread so no one else will get in contact with him and get a similar experience as I did. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-19/1624086397-552784-image.png
Mad - Mitchell F Johnson, and I were sharing my Hetzner Account. He was going to help me pay my server, and he needed to order dedicated servers on Hetzner, and he gave me his bank details , so I thought he was legit. I made him promise that he wouldn't touch any other servers besides the one he ordered. The first invoice (with all of his servers and my servers) totaled up to 195 euros. The day the invoice was due, he sent my friend this DM, 
 I got scared and I confronted him, I did not want to lose my hosting, I've been working on it for over 4 months, and I did not want to lose it. I asked him subtly without telling him that my friend sent that screenshot. 
 
  He continues to talk:
    
(censoring someones name, he doesn't want to be mentioned). And then he says that it was a prank: 
 And that he will expose the person who exposed him on drama.gg. I don't get it, drama.gg isn't that big of a deal, he takes drama.gg way to seriously. After I give him another chance, the invoice seemed to get paid.  But about 4 days later, I get this:  
It didn't pay, which means that either Mitchell provided me with fake a IBAN. The next day, I get an email saying that my email was removed from the hetzner account, and he makes a fake email to impersonate my friend, (the one who doesn't want to be mentioned). He blames everything on my friend.
 
And he says this: 

 He removed my email, so I asked him if he did. And he said that my friend did, and he gave access to my hetzner account to my friend because he was "sleepy", and make him pay it and do the work for him. I ask him for a screenshot of his email, saying that his email was removed, and he sends me this:
 
  He gives me an email of my friends name, but its a fake email. Its my friends name with a bunch of random numbers. This means that he created a fake email, to impersonate my friend. I ask my friend if its his email, and he sends me proof of his actual email, and confirm that Mitchell sent a fake email to me. He then says that it was him, and he had ordered his dedicated servers for his hosting he was working on, and I was helping him. We were going to be partners in a way, but then he says, "Blurple Host was only an operation to get your hetzner account and delete it." I convince him to give my hetzner account back. Somehow he did. But he ordered 2 dedicated servers on my account, so I'm left with a 195 euro bill, and I cannot pay that, I only have money for my own server. He says he cannot pay it, his "parents" wont allow him. 17 year old, and can't even use his own money. My only chance is that hetzner accepts my cancellation, and changes the invoice to my servers invoice. @Mitchell #0002 did all this, he ruined everything, he's lied to me, made fake accounts impersonating my friend, he threatens me to put me on drama.gg (though I don't know what he'll put, I do everything legit, all my accounts are under my dads name, and all of my money goes to his bank. I do everything with his consent.), he tries to blackmail me, he can't keep his promises. If hetzner does not change the invoice price, I will have to cancel my hosting. I will be so depressed, if that happens, I have worked over 4 months on it.

reizu - smh, i watched all of this happend, Mitchell is a full out scammer.
_MrKnight_ - wait why im getting james vibe from mitch!
Triassic - This is actually quite sad.
_MrKnight_ - also mitch left drama.gg
TME - Triassic owo triassic responded. Also I am really sad that this happened, mad is my very good friend and I have known him for a long time ;(
Mad - _MrKnight_ EXACTLY, and thanks to him, my hosting could be gone. He left me with a 195 euros unpaid invoice, and we were friends, and we were partners, and I trusted him. But he lied, and left me to pay it. I contacted hetzner to cancel his dedis, and only keep mine, and change the invoice price, no reply yet 🙁
_MrKnight_ - i think hetzner have a customer care number , why dont u call them? it is far better than mailing
TME - Mad hmm, did he block you on discord?
Mad - TME No, he's just begging me to not delete his server so he could backup. I tell him to leave me alone, but all he does it threaten me ("I can make a drama.gg post on you"), and at the same time begging me to not delete server yet.
Fallen - What the fuck is wrong with Mitchell, like scamming that much is just fucking wrong either way god damn. I feel sorry for you Mad.
TME - Mad umm you should delete it, to pay him back. What is the thing you are going to do now ;(
Fallen - TME Yes 100% delete that dedi.
Mad - TME Wait for Hetzner to respond, if they can't change my invoice price, either someone buys a really good plan from my hosting, or cancel my entire hosting. I've cancelled his dedicated server, but the invoice hasn't changed prices.
Fallen - Mad What is your hosting?
Mad - Fallen https://madhosting.tech Paid Minecraft / Discord Hosting. It's been going very well for the past 4 months. Can't say the same for the future :/
Fallen - That is a well made host I cannot lie.
_MrKnight_ - ik this is not the best time but , do u mind making your footer a bit better? - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-19/1624089035-654573-screenshot-1105.png
Mad - _MrKnight_ I already did, it's just not uploaded to the web server yet xd. I literally have the website project open in my IDE right now, I would've uploaded it already if it wasn't for all this.
_MrKnight_ - Mad also damn ur colour style is pretty pog 10/10 , also change ur logo color so it will match the theme and also the status page is ugly af
Mad - _MrKnight_ I will, if this gets sorted out, and I don't cancel hosting. This has motivated me alot, thank you everyone for the support.
_MrKnight_ - yeah we will support good host , i dont see a single bad thing u did here , u have proper tos , policy , uptime , ratings , paying bills etc . so why cant we support u lol
Deleted User - Mad Do it.

Jamie_ - Man, reading this is so sad. Why the hell do people have to be like this. @Mad I hope your host recovers from this and I agree with everyone else, your host looks good and I am sure it will recover.
Jxck_KV - If you ring them you will get a better response than email, but the fee's are quite expensive for just ringing them. I hope you don't need to cancel your hosting. 

Fuck you Mitchell.
Mad - Update: Hetzner has said that I have to pay the invoice, and any servers I cancelled, they'll refund it. One of the servers of the two servers that Mitchell bought, is past their refund policy. I've got no option left but to let my server go. 
Update 2: I've delayed my hosting until I can earn some money, all customers will get their refund (I only have 2 active customers :/ ), and given their backups. sigh This hosting was literally my life, but I'll be back.
Jxck_KV - Mitchell deserves anything that comes to him, Karma will hit him one day mate.

Once again, I feel sorry for you.
BaconHead - Moral: Never share your account with someone else
Mitchell - Mad Uh, oh
jeekie - Happened to me too before, as everyone else has said don't give people access to your accounts.

I'd also advise you to ensure you keep everything legitimate - as there's quite clearly some information that is not valid on your site.
Yie - Mitchell 
@Mad is the mitchell in the screenshot is this clown?
_MrKnight_ - Yie yep
Jamie_ - Mitchell is also extremely immature. I got a few DMs from him and he was trying everything he could to find something wrong with my host. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-01/1625176262-485834-image.png
