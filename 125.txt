eraters - I own frost node along with plactrix. We were wondering why de.fsn.14 just plain stopped working. Turns out, it's jen, back at it again. 
He is ddosing our de.fsn.14. In the other one he says "I don't ddos without asking." Well he never asked us this time and he's even hitting us with what he calls 2.5 tbps. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2020-10-14/1602682531-815437-image.png
