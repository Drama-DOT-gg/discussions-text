Knechtiieeee - Hello, my name is khootiee. Owner of a famous host that is called CloudMC and I am here to expose badsk so it's Halex members does not use Halex or any kind of badsk related service in their entire life so I can ruin badsk's reputation with valid proof given in this thread.

If you are a Halex member you need to see this since you are at risk, and this is very recommended for you to read because this involves Scamming, Illegal activities and bad services.

I will probably get hate for doing this thread but I am trying to protect everybody from using his hosting service(s) that are free nor paid.

If you are a Halex member, then you will see absolutely no ads in their client area or either their panel so they can make a little bit of profit from the host. But Badsk claims that they are aprooved in Nitropay but he also says that ads are annoying its members. But you need to think, how can badsk pay I9-13900K nodes that he states to have at the moment and all of the 5ghz CPU's that are overpriced.

The question is simple fellow Halex member, he does not pay at all. He just abuses a lot of providers such as Lightnode, Google Cloud Services, Hetzner, Orcale and even more.
A guy named "ItzScripts" but now his name is alvapepsi is selling GCP accounts for 20$ to badsk, if you go to https://securitytrails.com/list/apex_domain/halex.tech you can see all the providers that are easily abusable.

And for a Halex customer who pays badsk to get cheap vpses they are all free trails servers from free credits or abusable hosting providers. Some of his members even got scammed and not refunded after a few days, EVEN WEEKS! 

There are a lot of data loss on the host because the providers keep suspending him for abusing the services. We are reporting every provider he is using to that provider so we can let them know that badsk is abusing their services and get his account suspended quicky as possible.

Badsk scams his customers and users of course out of money because he apparently likes money, and he does not give a crap about Halex user base. 

I suggest everybody not to use Halex since they are scamming, and they are very unprofessional.
I'll be posting proofs and everything right now.

Badsk and ItzScripts (alvapepsi) admits to nuke CloudMC panel.


He states that he pays for his nodes but he actually isn't. If you go to this website https://securitytrails.com/list/apex_domain/halex.tech

You'll see that they only use Orcale, Vultr, Linode, Hetzner and Google cloud servievs but also lightnode and many many more.
He doesn't afford it at all - he doesn't get any money back except from scamming people out of 5$.


There was a customer who paid badsk so he can get a vps but after he bought his vps and used it for his host for a while.

He got scammed. He threatened everybody' in his host to leave his host and join Halex since their server data is there because badsk stole his own customers node.





But also look at the word "I don't scam anymore".

He is lying, he is actually scamming a ton of people at this day.

He convinces me to abuse with my credit card lmao...

Win - what a nerd 🤓
Koisip - The thing that annoys me the most about BadSK is the fact that there are so many threads/posts made against him saying that he is a scammer and liar.

And yet people continue to fall for his bullshit and buy his shit.
GeoHasCameBack - 🤓
alvapepsi - Ok, ItzScripts Here. For starters, I'm not associated with badsk or Halex however, yes I am friends with badsk. How can i be scamming my members if my services aren't even released yet? I have proof of this as on my website (https://hyotic.com) it says "Launching in December 2022.". Also, I have proof of khootiee/crac breaking discord's ToS. Read below!

alvapepsi - Also, khootiee dmed me when we are still friends saying his hetzner got terminated 🤣
alvapepsi - Also to clarify, yes I do sell GCP accounts to badsk. However, these GCP accounts are not 'abused' (well, that depends on your definition of 'abuse') as I pay for the GCP account with my own money.
alvapepsi - And yes I did nuke CloudMC's panel with badsk. The only reason this is, is because khootiee was using me (from what i can see). Read below for proof - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-11-17/1668708107-804848-image.png

alvapepsi - But above all of my previous messages, I really don't understand how I'm scamming my members if my services aren't even released lmfao
alvapepsi - Also when I had drama with him in the past, we had a thread about him and once I was cool with him again he dmed me asking if I could delete all my messages I sent (which I did, being a good friend) lmfaoo
BeansCam - cloud.mc.host is so crap lads

click there - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-11-17/1668709018-79962-image.png
alvapepsi - BeansCam I concur.
Imback - alvapepsi U dont pay for them you simply make them and sell them to badsk gcp is overpriced only a dumbass would choose to pay for their shit
alvapepsi - Imback By pay i mean pay for the trial.
Snyder - All of you here are fucking dumb fucks,  legit all of you ARE stupid than me.  "alvapepsi" is not scamming anyone, and "CloudMC" ain't shit, they just don't have many funds for hosting but they are trying their best. "Badsk" - the #1 scammer on discord shall I call him? Yes, we know he fucking scams. Does not mean   "alvapepsi" is also. Ik  "alvapepsi" cuz when he sold his GCP to badsk it was for funding of Yeliactyl. People mighty think khootiee is stupid dumb, and can't run a host. Well, he can if he had the funds to like Badsk. Badsk using free credit and trials for Halex (The causes of Data Loss if you were wondering). He used to card.   "alvapepsi" does not realize he is getting used by Badsk, like how khootie used  "alvapepsi".  Everyone on this thread is dumb, ye go ahead I don't give a fuck call me dumb cuz i messaged on this thread. You gotta know CloudMC will have no data loss as soon as it gets funds. Unlike Halex fucking DM advertising in my DMs. Boris Dickinson#5788 and Lee Gibson#4505 their profile pictures as businessmen., who tf would do that, Ik CloudMC would not. "alvapepsi" AkA ItzScripts please leave Badsk as soon as you can, I am saying this for your future and you rep. Me and khootiee know Badsk well from when he took over CloudMC and joint it with Fucking Halex. Khootie I hope u fucking learned a lesson from that. Now back to the topic of Scamming. Don't fucking use hosts that use trial providers unless they have a channel showing proof of payment. Trust me on Halex Re-Launch Halex is gonna get ddosed very hard. Yes harder than your dad in bed with your mum. Ik many people who would do it. I not gonna name them here. Now fucking leave "alvapepsi" and CloudMC alone.  Btw remember HC7, HC6, HC5, HC3 fucking halex shit. 

I feel bad for members who host on Halex and CloudMC.
Please just use paid host, if you afford that use oracle cloud free tier to host you mc server, and use TCP shield or Catto shield to protect it. If you don't want to use that, use OptikServers ot FalixNodes or Avex (releasing soon, not data loss will occur)
alvapepsi - Snyder I agree on some parts of the message.
Imback - alvapepsi the trial is literally free all they do is do a temp charge of like 1 eur to make sure the card is real and then insta refunds it
Snyder - alvapepsi 
You have to agree will all of it.
alvapepsi - Imback It doesnt refund it for me, atleast from what i've seen
alvapepsi - Snyder Too bad, so sad
alvapepsi - https://drama.gg/d/2070-khootiee-aka-crac-being-a-dick-and-unprofessional for more proof against khootiee
alvapepsi - Khootiee knows hes been exposed so hard and is ignoring the thread 🤣
KIVOX - Knechtiieeee Owner of a famous host that is called CloudMC

alvapepsi - KIVOX LMFAO
Jen - alvapepsi That's how you know your not famous and some random desperate for attention.
Timanttikuutio - Jen fax
alvapepsi - Jen I never said I was famous, crac did
alvapepsi - Knechtiieeee So your stating that using GCP, Hetzner, Lightnode, Vultr, Linode or Oracle automaticly means someone is abusing?
gsfH - Fun fact: khootiee shat on badsk and now he works with him again lol.
Jxshxx11 - gsfH 
literally all free host drama ends up like this lmao
gsfH - Jxshxx11 The free hosting industry is straight up a joke in my opinion its ran by 12 - 13 yr old dumbasses
Jxshxx11 - gsfH

Jen - alvapepsi bro y u even on this site

gsfH - Jxshxx11 I would personally just buy a plan from a trustworthy provider
alvapepsi - Jen okay and??

gsfH - alvapepsi OGs are more respected as they tend to not be dumbasses that just make useless threads
Timanttikuutio - alvapepsi dude who even are you 💀
