Javacraft - Hey, okay this Rizer dude is being really disrespectful to me and broke agreement for me giving someone, permission on the panel that he doesn't like.
Javacraft - I'm fucking tired of this kid tihnking he is the best when he isn't really doing anything
Javacraft - Banning me for not liking something that I was amnging okay.
Jedrik - Please provide evidence, context, and the full story within 48 hours.
Fallen - I am not fully aware of the situation, But from what I have seen @Rizer is a very immature individual. He threatened Javacraft @luffy and me at Ark Hosting. Javacraft Did not do anything wrong, Rizer was just being a dick. If you would like more of a story add me on Discord: Fallen#9999
Javacraft - He was lying to me &amp; many poeple about his age he would say he was "17", "18", "in colledge". He was only here for the money, and he was abusive and really rude to anyone that got in his way of his fame. He demoted me for giving someone pterodactyl admin and he was very pissed about it. Than he told me I broke the agreement when we had a agreement, that I manged the panel. He was going to use Ark-Host.xyz file for his own hosting company which is very stupid. Iceey even was there when we made the agreement.
eraters - I was requested to delete javacraft's message because it contained another person's snapchat info.
Javacraft - I don't fucking care. This doesn't mean he needs to lie his own age.
Deleted User - Hello Users,

I have not exposed anyone with anything yet you are exposing me for something that is personal related, now you are not mentally fit to be in Ice Hosting let alone I have proof of you scamming everyone in your past let alone You moving host and taking peoples money I say your paypal account and you also did raid me which is something I would never do, Now I get you are mad but you are not suited to be dating anyone, I may have lied about my ace but I meet the minimal requirements for Discords ToS- but I don't want people knowing my personal info, Now I can relate and I know many people who have lied about their age including you, you look 12 years old and cry to your friends when you are mad, You get upset and threaten people, so ion even wanna hear it.
eraters - Why would i care about that opinion? You're the most unprofessional person I've ever seen. You circumvented punishments on alts, you treat everyone like assholes making the world your bitch. You need to gain some sense of anything. I also have no idea why you're using an alt to post, BabyAces.
Deleted User - Heres also some - proof!%5B%5D%28https%3A//media.discordapp.net/attachments/805636075858952202/808185825040400394/image0.png?width=313&amp;height=241%29

Javacraft - I'm not even going to ddoes you... 
Your the person who stole my company from under my feet.
Javacraft - Saying that i'm "14", even ask all my friends they fucking now my real age, and it's 14. Not like you lieing to everyone about everything you say.

Saying me scamming them of 50$ per 3.5k views, acutally no. I was about to pay them when you demoted me..
Javacraft - @eraters  Change this to Rizer | Scamming | Stealing | Lying
Deleted User - YOUR LITERALLY 12 then- Your face is young and you IP log
Deleted User - How am I scamming?
Javacraft - YOUR LITERALLY 12 then- Your face is young and you IP log

We do check ips if your alt. That's acceptable all free hosting's do that.

How your scamming...
Telling all the users that I was a secruity risk, taking my discord and running, scamming ark of there site...
Javacraft - Plus I am not 12, even ask hye that.
Deleted User - I like how you also have the trust in me to send me all your VPS Passwords and PayPal Passwords and I havent leaked it.
Javacraft - He stole SMP server from a guy that wanted to make a smp server for Ice ...
Deleted User - I like how you are also begging me to buy things and you cant even afford a VPS and you have to get 50% off all yours items.
EdwardSnowde - So who is who, I know who Rizer is, and who is Javacraft, is this a 3rd alt of Aces?
eraters - yessir
Deleted User - All of these:
 251378449602576384
708324636437250120
762931157498331157
805992969077129217

Are aces
Javacraft - @EdwardSnowde  Do not trust him, go to @Fallen, @luffy  @Jedrik,
Deleted User - Lmao, Jedrik could care less- Hes a mod.
Fallen - For the full story: It started when @Rizer was demoted from Developer of Ark Hosting to Member, He then threatened to sue Ark Hosting over a "NDA Contract" that was not valid. Later on @Rizer was promoted back to Developer then even Staff Manager, Later on he and Javacraft started dating. When that happened he was constantly taking advantage of Aces and using him for fame and to get power in Ark Hosting, When aces denied him what he wanted aka Director role in Ark Hosting, He then proceeded to add me and @luffy to a group chat where he threatened to attack Ark Hosting if we did not comply with what he wanted, Eventually the drama died down... Until today... @Rizer got mad over Aces making someone panel admin on Ice Hosting's Panel. Even when I was staff at Ice Hosting, I had signed a contract stating I would be a member of "Management" but I was only given Developer, @Rizer said Aces agreed to that but I asked aces and he gave me manager and Panel Administrator because that was how it was supposed to be. He also said he was going to use the Dashactyl Dashboard files from Ark Hosting for his own host. Those files are a custom theme for Dashactyl Dashboard that is copyrighted. If he does so he will be sued. So to be honest... @Rizer is a LIAR and a Scammer. He has lied countless times to me and Javacraft. @Rizer needs to learn his lesson and stop being a child.

Sincerely, 
Fallen - CTO of Ark Hosting
EdwardSnowde - Javacraft  How could he sweep your company if it was yours? If it was yours this wouldn't have happened. You tried to work with a partner that got convinced from all your blazing stuff from ark Host
Javacraft - @EdwardSnowde , I had to have agreement with @Iceey  which I didn't break... He said I broke it becuase I didn't tell him something that I really didn't need to tell him.

Best Rewards,
Something New coming soon!
Fallen - Rizer So?
Fallen - Rizer He can afford a VPS he has bought Many.
Fallen - Rizer He is not 12 he is 14.
Deleted User - It has just come to my attention a user in my Ice host server was scammed by Aces, and Aces you can't just say "I was going to pay them" as an excuse and @Fallen this has nothing to do with ark I had nothing with ark because Ark is ew. That's why I left and I have the code if you want me to start giving it out I mean I was just told it doesn't matter, and Aces you even admitted to being a Trash Dev and you use REPOS lmao I can't even with that part, Your nodes are trash the only way you are in ark is because you provide nodes, or they would have kicked your as* by now.
Deleted User - Proof of him scamming again: https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/807013592623743027/808191460771233832/Screenshot_2021-02-07_at_10.21.08_PM.png?width=710&amp;height=309
Javacraft - Me admiting he a trash dev. No he fucking his. I have never said those words out that. The only thing I asked him to do is do the status embed. I'm paying 100$ for your ass in the few days that you are going to be paying me back for... You have broke the agreement many times and storming off and getting mad. This is fucking how childish you are. You think everything is a fucking a game...

Best Regards,
Rizershit.com
Deleted User - Anyways regarding your contract I am under 18 so that was voided, and regarding that "NDA" it would be voided due to the fact I am also UNDER 18 so yalls got like a 1IQ I mean I said I was under 18 the whole time lmaooo
EdwardSnowde - I wanna hear both parties of this shit show, @Rizer tell me your story, @BabyAces /@Javacraft  tell me your story
Javacraft - Aucutally I contact them back and I am paying them.
Deleted User - Also I won't be paying you back because you are no longer providing Ice host nor myself with any active services.
Javacraft - @Rizer  Are you sure your not talking about your self?
EdwardSnowde - Rizer did a guardian sign the contact if so it would still be in place. if not welp rip for the other party
Deleted User - I mean I can make a simple ticket bot without using this repo: https://github.com/eartharoid/DiscordTickets/
Javacraft - I can... I just can't use a open sourch ticket bot..
Deleted User - Well proves you nor fallen is a bad dev.
luffyy - when rizer was working as a developer in Ark-Host he had files to our dashboard he had not deleted it from his pc when he was demoted and is thinking about using it for his own host
but the theme we had was bought which can get him legally sued by them
Deleted User - nor = not for your brain btw
Javacraft - @Rizer  The one that doesn't now pterodactyl and trying to run a hosting company???? That's fucking crazy doesn't now the pterodactyl API?
Deleted User - when rizer was working as a developer in Ark-Host he had files to our dashboard he had not deleted it from his pc when he was demoted and is thinking about using it for his own host
but the theme we had was bought which can get him legally sued by them

I am under no NDA nor contract from them nor you about those files.
Javacraft - The one that had me install pterodactyl for you.
Deleted User - THEN WHY AM I SETTING UP A PANEL RIGHT NOW ON MY PC?
Deleted User - If you really think I don't have a PC your wrong boy.
luffyy - Rizer if thats the case why did you steal his code?
Javacraft - "THEN WHY AM I SETTING UP A PANEL RIGHT NOW ON MY PC?
The one who complained to me that htey didn't like the thing I did for them?
Deleted User - Your thing was trash- You subdomain user.
Javacraft - He fucking stole my client area code which I'm going to send a DMCA report after him.
Deleted User - Luffy, He stole MCHost's Code soooooo...
EdwardSnowde - now why was this @Rizer ? If he wrote the code, he has full copyright over his works. If he customized code from some place like Creative Tim, it would still be partially under control by Rizer, if this was devloped by the actual Ark Hosting company then they would have partial copyright, as I was told by Aces, that it was a theme
Fallen - Rizer Ark Host is not ew. If it was why did you ask back into the staff team after being demoted?
Deleted User - It doesn't matter if it was a "theme" I am under no obligation to conceal any information I have gathered.
Deleted User - @Fallen I wanted to help it not be ew,
Fallen - Rizer Those files are Copyrighted.
Fallen - Rizer Sure u did
Javacraft - EdwardSnowde now why was this @Rizer ? If he wrote the code, he has full copyright over his works. If he customized code from some place like Creative Tim, it would still be partially under control by Rizer, if this was devloped by the actual Ark Hosting company then they would have partial copyright, as I was told by Aces, that it was a theme

No the MCHost client area he has a download of which I told him that he couldn't download and he was just went and did it with out my permission.
eraters - Hey yall, i reccomend going and checking out https://winterhoax.com/dndw. some new reasons in there
EdwardSnowde - Javacraft  So from my understanding, he stole the MCHost that was devloped by AYS?
Javacraft - He wiped the docuement with all the information. He is a stealing scammer hoe which we should all advoid
Javacraft - @EdwardSnowde  Yes
Deleted User - I have Ark's theme only- not MCHost's and I NEVER STOLE ANY LOGS nor deleted any information I want proof of this.
EdwardSnowde - eraters  so that would already put Ace's new accout with DNDW

Contract
eraters - yes, it would
Javacraft - Rizer Today, in our call you said you had a copy of the files. So stop lying.
Deleted User - That contract wasn't legal nor was it bound to a state to be inforced- Thus I am not over 18 so it's invalid.
@Fallen
EdwardSnowde - I will contact AYS/Spamm to see if you bought the panel
Javacraft - @eraters  Can he have DNDW?
Deleted User - @Javacraft lmao, You really think I am that stupid to download them? I only have Ark's
Javacraft - @Jedrik  I don't really care, that I have DNDW, I already have it.
Fallen - Rizer Then why did u act like it was valid u scammy bitch?
luffyy - Rizer which you can get sued for if you use it
Deleted User - I didn't buy no panel nor client area- I don't have any code but ARK HOSTING Code
@EdwardSnowde
EdwardSnowde - luffyy  Well if he's under 18, his parents will be on the hook
Deleted User - I never scammed, stole, or deleted code. I don't use any previous panels nor would I ever.
luffyy - EdwardSnowde yep its actually a really big company so umm would it be the streets or the gutter?
Deleted User - I didn't sign with my parents name so thus there is no valid agreement/contract since im under 18
luffyy - Rizer ive got pictures saying that you were going to use the panel
EdwardSnowde - luffyy So Ark Hosting is a registered business?
Deleted User - "was goinig" Never said I am nor are using the panel.
Deleted User - Ark Hosting is not registered no.
luffyy - Rizer it dosent matter ur using a nulled theme you/your family will be sued by the orginal creator of the theme i bought it from
luffyy - EdwardSnowde i dont need to sue him
theres a different company that has full rights to sue him
luffyy - aka https://themes.getbootstrap.com/product/front-admin-dashboard-template/
EdwardSnowde - luffyy  Can't they still even get yall on the hook for redistrobution?
luffyy - EdwardSnowde nope.
Deleted User - The fact that you gave me the code in the first place would be on you since you took the security risk against your panel, users &amp; your code.
luffyy - Rizer u never had the full code
EdwardSnowde - Wait, may I ask what type of tier of license you bought
Deleted User - Maybe not the full code but the full code of the theme yes.
luffyy - removed the database, parts of settings.json so that you couldnt use it for a panel
Deleted User - lmaoo, Yet it's still there.
luffyy - EdwardSnowde multi its a theme bought by my father for multiple sites in his company which i use
Deleted User - This is no longer involving Ice Host it's moved past that to Ark off-topic
luffyy - their contract takes actions against actions just like this
EdwardSnowde - luffyy  Is it being used for paid?
Deleted User - So it's not bought by you? and thus there is no license?
luffyy - EdwardSnowde what?
EdwardSnowde - luffyy Are paying clients using this page?
luffyy - EdwardSnowde no
luffyy - Rizer theres a license issued for multiple sites by my father so yes there is a license
EdwardSnowde - luffyy ok. Any donors?
luffyy - EdwardSnowde we dont accept donors cause were more proffesional and having a online billing management page so as of now no
luffyy - Fallen we dont have any ;-;
luffyy - Fallen u legit said lets announce the donors thingy after we get some nodes back up
Deleted User - Now even your Director is lying??
Deleted User - Seems like erratic responses here.
Fallen - Rizer No I was confused on the topic
Deleted User - I would also like to talk about Ice Host as this is against the Server, and this is going off topic.
luffyy - Rizer yes its not like u used ur so called boyfriend to try getting director in ark host
yeh nothing like that happened right?
luffyy - Hello, Rizer,
Our issues today is with you stealing my company under my feet, and than blamming everything on me... That really wasnt a fucking nice thing to do when your not providing anything you were being a very big dick to everyone. Ice Hosting staff members were in a call when this all took place. The thing you didnt like was that I was promoting oreo to panel admin which I didnt need to ask you because he already had vps access to everything. You are a over reactive cunt muffin that doesnt fucking now how to run a hosting company.

Best Regards,

BabyAces
Fallen - @Rizer ^
Deleted User - Okay, This all started when BabyAces had the first argument, I've had a lot of people come into my Dm's saying aces is a scammer and do not trust him/her at any point in time, now this started to occur to me after 2 days ago in a huge fight with his school friends from his 8th Grade I also have proof from your friend that you are 14 so even you are lying on this thread- I suggest you stop lying.  Proof
Age message was approved by- Eraters


  luffy regarding Ark Hosting I have no intentions of using it's(Ark Host's) Panel at any point in time today was a test of BabyAces loyalship to me and the server which is the reason I had him give me ownership and half his old friends/staff are with me now.

Thanks,
Ice host CEO - Rizer
Deleted User - Here is also some Proof on which you can not re-distribute your theme @Fallen @luffyy Proof
