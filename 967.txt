rhys - Triassic the sad fact is its not
rhys - Uses Google Cloud: - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-09-06/1630923368-947978-iklogzqf.png

Ibrahim - they use a freenom domain, Google cloud (likely free trial), they act hella immature, can't even setup dashboard, don't know how to make subdomains and ++ think your mom jokes are funny and use tiktok comebacks 🤡
rhys - Ibrahim He also uses free trials just doesn't admit to it, 


Apparently the panel is the website?


Still doesn't want to list node specs either. 

Doesn't know what a subdomain is either &amp; being a weirdo. 



This host is really bad. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-09-06/1630928745-968580-cu1nhxqg.png

sus_person - They recently showed up to Centro too and sent NSFW stuff
rhys - sus_person damn
a-random-sylveon - S
Servers prob weren’t hosted on a free trial had about 30 plugins running purpur with two players had 20 tps the whole time when I did modded it reached 8 cores (I won some extra) but ya not sure about panel but I vouch for this host - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-09-07/1631041585-338557-e26bf2ab-dea9-4acc-a718-5a7b078cfa67.png
Kowone - a-random-sylveon i don't think the man has the capabilities to pay a lot to host your servers for free
Kowone - and i'm banned for asking what's the nodes provider
Kowone - it's not like i did anything wrong smh
dchu096 - jesus, how many domains did this host has 😳 and they are not related at all.
Ptero - drama.gg the shittiest website
Kowone - Ptero oh do you mean qloggedhost's?
rhys - Ptero nah, just you. your host is shit.
rhys - Kowone same
rhys - dchu096 cause no subdomains is the way to go sniff
Axyboi - Just wanna chip in a bit with what I just experienced:

Never talked in the server, sent only 2 messages before which were jokes along the lines of:
(Bit of context for it, he was being angry at staff or smth for being slow) "So are you paying them, or are they paying you to work for you?" - Instantly deleted, when I asked "Why delete?" - Deleted again

Then today this: - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-09-11/1631368202-728564-image.png
KejiDiscord - he pings @everyone in the "general-english" channel
 And he banned me when i said he cloudnt doge this cus he was using a free .tk domain and google cloud trial LOL
dxqt - he banning all new people LOL
babyharpseal - lmao - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-09-11/1631371250-272514-screenshot-2021-09-11-16-40-33-07.jpg
dxqt - poggers
Axyboi - dxqt Well I got banned it seems, despite doing literally almost nothing, just being in the server, that's nice, a quality host shining its beauty 😃
dxqt - Axyboi i still have my alt in there
dxqt - he revoked all invite and banning every1
Sebasorova - I got banned because I didnt joined to the host alredy, I was looking if the host was good and trusted and he banned me lol, also he said something about the customer ips, I think something is, extrange here
Scripted - i fucking breached all customer's ip and past ips.
lmfao such a shit host which can be hacked
Thominek - The owner is being anti VPNs he wants to store ur ip address and then sell it
Thominek - and the owner childish asf he pinged everyone only to say penis and then delete it and doing it multiple times, banned me fo saying Stop faking it become a man because he was saying that some random guy token logged him to ping everyone lol
rhys - such a weird host
Sebasorova - Scripted lol, I used a vpn, but that host is 100% not safe (plus I got banned by using an ip to enter that host so... the owner logs ips for his own use)
Sebasorova - Thominek I agree, is sus, if an inexpert user gets into that host and gets in trouble with the owner I think the owner will expose his ip or idk
rhys - Sebasorova the owner doesnt know anything and abuses companys, its really fucking odd
Thominek - Sebasorova yes hes very untrustworthy and sus but people keep using his host because of the resources: 5GB of ram 20 GB of disk 200 CPU with that resources his host wont last that long because the nodes will go boom is everyone will use that resources at once
comfyy - rhys Wix TOS/PP (whats merged together) http://qloxhostprivacypolicy.tk/

Imagine using Wix and not even customizing it
rhys - comfyy imagine using wix in general 💀
dxomgmyfriend - Axyboi XD
dxomgmyfriend - rhys Can you send again discord link? i wanna see this with my own eyes lol
Thominek - dont even click on their pages without an vpn the owner is saving everyone IP adresses and do smth sketchy with them

rhys - _MrKnight_ lmfao, 512mb ram, half a core and 1gb storage
iiChxrlly_ - rhys lol look at this indonesian channels locked

He readed the drama.gg thread lmfao - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-10-04/1633351044-667435-image.png
iiChxrlly_ - iiChxrlly_ I always added whats new and the node specifications here :L
Or I say I will edit this thread right there if I found this piece of crap kiddo trying to do something
CharityLexus - Wait can wix sites grab your ip? I visited his crappy privacy policy and forgot to use a vpn with that
iiChxrlly_ - CharityLexus It doesnt
CharityLexus - iiChxrlly_ ah good
ShinyPlasm - Clearly this guy is no older than 11. Extremely immature, cannot speak English properly, seems as if he uses TikTok, all his comebacks are either anti-homosexual or "your mom" and mutes users for asking wondering why "staff can't be hired". 

GCP provides 300 USD of free credit for the first few months, just wait a few months and everything will disappear. If not using free credit, definitely relying on his parents credit card. Wouldn't be surprised if he's stealing their money

 I really want to dox him just to shut him and his inflated ego up, but that's illegal and I'm a law abiding citizen 😄
Aaron_ - ShinyPlasm I'm a law abiding citizen 😄

Yea you sure are
Noobbot - qlox host banneed?

Jamie_ - Their admins are now trying to bypass the dashactyl blacklist I put in place. It is there for a reason. Another reason to not trust this host. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-11-09/1636493758-610889-image.png
Tato - I have wrapped up everything they have done and are possibly doing in a single post.
Enjoy the top reasons to which why you shouldn't use this host even if you're out of your mind.

Freenom domains.
Straight up nono, not only can they lose their sites, this just substantiates they have no money and are possibly using free trials.

Advertising Methods.
They have advertised in other hosting companies' Discord™ guilds.

The host itself. Just how bad is it?
To start, they do not know or have any dashboard setup and thus users need to create tickets to make servers. This is a horrible system straight up.
It is running on google cloud, most likely a free trial. They refused to show the nodes' IPs or specifications to @rhys, any host should not have problems with this, further proving that they are possibly using a Google™ Cloud free trial.
There's no actual website, the owner claims the panel is the "website". (Click here to open).
Banning users for no reason completely.
And now, their admins have recently tried to bypass the dashactyl blacklist @Jamie_ put in place for them.

Legal Documents.
(Hosted on WIX) I think it's pretty clear but I'm gonna say it again, more evidence of them not having money to pay for actual nodes and using free trials! TOS / PP thing http://qloxhostprivacypolicy.tk/ (Really weird and messed up, seems like they combined the two in one).
Capitals have been wrongly placed everywhere over the TOS / PP document.
Grammar is not at its best, I can't call it moderate, perhaps the effect of having been written by an 11-year-old. Just saying. Also uses too many "till" style words.

The owner...
This is a deep rabbit hole so let's get to it.
The owner does not like the use of  VPNs to mask your IP address. They also save them and most possibly sell them.
He is abusive; he tends to ping everyone constantly for no good reason and as @Thominek mentioned here he also says words just like "penis" whilst at it.
Has publicly announced I quote "want to help qloxhost get better nodes and stuff like that just support please sign up at [REDACTED] it will make the bitcoin miner faster meaning I get more money meaning better nodes! u can also use this [REDACTED]" [REDACTED] = Cryptocurrency mining web sites.

### (11/11/21) Invite Rewards.
Straight up prohibited by Discord, now they're doing invite rewards. Amazing.


(11/11/21) Their hate against the drama.gg community.
First of all, this admin "HasX" apparently is starting a petition to shut down drama.gg which is just fucking brilliant.

Same for the CEO (such a low hit) where he didn't even try that much to use grammar

One of their worst admins even made a drama.gg thread about how drama.gg is the most toxic community! 🤦‍♀️

Now for the conclusion,
Does it deserve the hate?
Yes, it completely does. You would NOT want to trust them with any of your personal information nor visit their websites. Not only do they log your IP address and possibly do malicious things with it, but they also require a full billing address just to signup as the owner said. This is not the host to go to or even consider.

Thanks for reading and have a lovely day!
-ItsTato
P. S. They have rebranded to "Kitten Nodes". Here's an invite link, tell me if it expires! - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-11-11/1636641228-270476-image.png

Straight up nono, not only can they lose their sites, this just substantiates they have no money and are possibly using free trials.

Advertising Methods.
They have advertised in other hosting companies' Discord™ guilds.

The host itself. Just how bad is it?
To start, they do not know or have any dashboard setup and thus users need to create tickets to make servers. This is a horrible system straight up.
It is running on google cloud, most likely a free trial. They refused to show the nodes' IPs or specifications to @rhys, any host should not have problems with this, further proving that they are possibly using a Google™ Cloud free trial.
There's no actual website, the owner claims the panel is the "website". (Click here to open).
Banning users for no reason completely.
And now, their admins have recently tried to bypass the dashactyl blacklist @Jamie_ put in place for them.

Legal Documents.
(Hosted on WIX) I think it's pretty clear but I'm gonna say it again, more evidence of them not having money to pay for actual nodes and using free trials! TOS / PP thing http://qloxhostprivacypolicy.tk/ (Really weird and messed up, seems like they combined the two in one).
Capitals have been wrongly placed everywhere over the TOS / PP document.
Grammar is not at its best, I can't call it moderate, perhaps the effect of having been written by an 11-year-old. Just saying. Also uses too many "till" style words.

The owner...
This is a deep rabbit hole so let's get to it.
The owner does not like the use of  VPNs to mask your IP address. They also save them and most possibly sell them.
He is abusive; he tends to ping everyone constantly for no good reason and as @Thominek mentioned here he also says words just like "penis" whilst at it.
Has publicly announced I quote "want to help qloxhost get better nodes and stuff like that just support please sign up at [REDACTED] it will make the bitcoin miner faster meaning I get more money meaning better nodes! u can also use this [REDACTED]" [REDACTED] = Cryptocurrency mining web sites.

### (11/11/21) Invite Rewards.
Straight up prohibited by Discord, now they're doing invite rewards. Amazing.


(11/11/21) Their hate against the drama.gg community.
First of all, this admin "HasX" apparently is starting a petition to shut down drama.gg which is just fucking brilliant.

Same for the CEO (such a low hit) where he didn't even try that much to use grammar

One of their worst admins even made a drama.gg thread about how drama.gg is the most toxic community! 🤦‍♀️

Now for the conclusion,
Does it deserve the hate?
Yes, it completely does. You would NOT want to trust them with any of your personal information nor visit their websites. Not only do they log your IP address and possibly do malicious things with it, but they also require a full billing address just to signup as the owner said. This is not the host to go to or even consider.

Thanks for reading and have a lovely day!

P. S. They have rebranded to "Kitten Nodes". Here's an invite link, tell me if it expires! - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-11-11/1636641531-412523-image.png
rhys - Tato Yeah, pretty much sums it up.
Tato - rhys Added 2 new sections regarding recent updates to it
rhys - Tato Great!
Sappy - Tato Here's an invite link, tell me if it expires!

it expired, can you make a new one? I wanna see more of their crap lmao
Tato - Sappy They banned my main when they found this thread I think. I only have my alt which is currently my only way to see what they do. I'd rather not risk the alt -- sorry!
Jen - If they can't even pay for a website and a domain
There's no reason to believe they invested in good stuff
MerK2 - rhys I know this is a post from 2021 but that is fake, that freenom domain was created by a crazy user and he started spamming it by DMs and servers, im really sorry for that.
Regards, QloxHost Management Team.
