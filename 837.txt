MysteriousK69 - Hey,

First of all, I would like to start with pointing out the fact that they lie about being partnered with MoonHost. Willypro7, the owner of MoonHost can confirm this.

One of the founders is really irresponsible and even claims to not be a founder. He just wants his friend to take care of literally everything.



They did not even have money to start a host (why start a host if you can't afford to do it in the first place lmao)

He then tries to waste our time by saying shit like "proof you are owner moonhost @Mr. P ツ willy"


He just ignores me when I ask for their privacy policy and tos.

You can also see them be really unprofessional throughout all of the screenies, like in this one he starts spamming crying emojis. (who even uses those emojis seriously lmao)

Their management doesn't even know what a host is.

The founders don't even know their own position in the company lmfao.

Mr. P ツ willy
Translation of what SAAD said there, "I am a servant".

Oh, congrats on cashing out on someone else's work!


We couldn't get anything else because they banned us.

Credits to Willypro7 - @Willypro7  for introducing me to the company, testifying about them not being partened, and giving the screenies.

Feel free to add anything to this thread.

Thanks,
