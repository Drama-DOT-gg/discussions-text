HTTPS shows that it's been 'mirrored by another company.'


Their ToS apparently represents another company by the name of "Blackhost." Moreover, it's still copied from another hosting company. 

THIS IS VIOLATING COPYRIGHT LAWS! THIS COMPANY CAN BE LEGALLY SUED!!! FREE MONEY RIGHT HERE!!!


Reselling Nodes and Violating TOS
Attempted to resell VPSs with Azure



(Possibly) Selling Google Cloud Services




Greedy Shit
Attempting to give ports in return for "4 invites per month"


Claiming other art as his own w/o crediting (He did not make the logo)

As we speak, a legal team is planning to go after him for violating several laws and ToS. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-11-05/1667613200-187149-image.png

EndermanPvP - extremely sus might i add
Koisip - Also as of 10/30/2022, Cyized apparently turned 13. 


Yet his hosting business started on August 12. Meaning he somehow had a PayPal account at the age of 12. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-11-05/1667617244-832346-image.png

EndermanPvP - 💀
EndermanPvP - first of all, cyized doesnt even get any money, tom does.
Koisip - EndermanPvP I would encourage Tom to pull out his Paypal since he would be considered an "accessory to a crime." He can be sued as well since he is encouraging it.
TommyTheMango - Koisip Thanks for more info I will pull out my paypal from imposter.
Cyizedd - On the Stealing Website Allegation:
I have had full permission from the person (BBAGOD) to use his website in my code. 
Their ToS apparently represents another company by the name of "Blackhost." Moreover, it's still copied from another hosting company. Allegation:
This is simply not true. We used to own a host with @EndermanPvP and we used to sell hosting like we do now. But, the reason why we changed the name and Discord Server was that Enderman was just being rude to me. and deleting my servers and complained when i used to go over my RAM Cap???????????
So, that is the reason as to why I used to be called Blackout Nodes not Blackhost (Whatever that is.)
Reselling Nodes and Violating TOS Allegation:
I never had any azure nodes as you will see in the image attached. I clearly said in its own words. "what
I said mostly oracle. I don't have azure rn. when we grow I will invest in azure". So i never had Microsoft Azure nodes in the first place. 
(Possibly) Selling Google Cloud Services Allegation:
That is a DNS which is probably CloudFlare. I have never used Google Cloud in my life.
Greedy Shit Allegation:
That isn't against TOS. so, mind your business.
Somehow has a paypal account despite being underaged... Allegation:
I never used a PayPal account, I either used my parent's PayPal or Tom's PayPal.
This is the only time i'm using the stupid website. Have a good day. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-11-06/1667738011-796118-willy.png

This proves nothing. "Deleted User" can literally be anyone.

Not Using Azure

You claim: " I don't have azure rn. when we grow I will invest in azure"
Yet this statement contradicts it. 
It's either you are lying or trying to hide bullshit. 

Greedy Shit
Inviting users or attempting to do invite rewards is against Discord ToS.


Not to forget, you already seem to have violated Discord ToS on how old you are. 

You somehow managed to make an account at the age of 8. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-11-06/1667756028-491459-image.png

XxMBGxX - Koisip Okay so not to defend anyone here but their website could have been also made using Mobirise because that's what the website is made of but they decided to copy 🤣🤣🤣
XxMBGxX - EndermanPvP that was rhyming
Loser - Koisip You somehow managed to make an account at the age of 8.
