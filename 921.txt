ItzFiran_ - i shared the link of this thrade
ProtectorYTNotFound - I mean idk
Grabstop - ProtectorYTNotFound I even told you in DMs that you should get one ASAP and you told me the website was deleted, however i found further proof that the website was never deleted and is in fact stolen.
While you guys claim to be run under Falix LLC.

Proof below: 



Plus you guys charge ridiculously low prices for hosting like cmon it's unrealistic and unprofitable unless you are using a vultr free plan as stated above. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-26/1629981053-25038-image.png
Altamash347 - This hosting is illegal and it must be shutdown no one should trust a hosting which does illegal activities. We know that they use Free VPS and the hosting will close after the trial ends. They dont even care about TOS and PP because they know the host will be closed lmao
DarkThunder - I don't Understand why People use Hosting Services which don't have Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions
ProtectorYTNotFound - Ayo why did i got pinged iam not even owner of that host
