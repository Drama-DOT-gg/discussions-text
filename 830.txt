danielpy - What is the better hosting for VPS I can get with low price
EmeraldMike - danielpy  do you mean VPS
EmeraldMike - Also this is the worst place to ask in my opinion.
IoNetty - danielpy https://hostily.cloud
EmeraldMike - IoNetty  WTH
Yeah no 6GHP for 6GB RAM on a shit cpu GE location. For budget. I would recommend my host that has actually good prices. DMs are open.
Vhodou - Hmm search on google instead, lol
danielpy - EmeraldMike Can you send me the link of your host?
KIVOX - danielpy Just use hetzner cloud.
Deleted User - danielpy JeekieHost in my opinion. I use it and I have no issues
EmeraldMike - mituishere  they also bought out another host recently. It's also meh from raw pricing on there site.
europa - danielpy hetzner cloud. if you need really REALLY cheap you can go ghosty.host ig
Fallen_ - danielpy bro contabo all the way, no?
babyharpseal - Fallen_ If it's for personal use, yes, if it's for a hosting, just don't
EmeraldMike - Fallen_  go kermit die
Tomas - EmeraldMike i thought u also sold xeon 1650v4 vps
EmeraldMike - Tomas  we still have xeons but we got the good stuff as well like i9 9900k and Ryzen 9 5950x. at great prices too (; (;
