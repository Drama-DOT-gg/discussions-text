xKhqos - RumGuru I got that from the start, that is why I left the staff team.
I realised that something would happen to the host soon enough, and I did not want to be apart of it.
I was support team, so I had an easy time leaving, unlike some unlucky others.
WaffleHost was not at all professional in support, they treated the community poorly and more. I tried to make it a good community, but it did not work 0ut so I had left.
xKhqos - EiskalterFreund DDoS attacks are illegal, and is considered a heavy cybercrime. 
You should definitely report James to online support, along with any other information that would be important to the situation. He can get up to 10 years in jail and a huge fine, worth thousands of dollars.
If he gets fined, he wouldn't be able to do this anymore, along with the jail time.
Thanks, xKhqos#0011.
AKHATISTHELEADERkhatdoe - But the question still exists. How many megashits per megafart does the PS5 have?
EiskalterFreund - xKhqos yes
DHiro - xKhqos I didn't ddos him..
Ash777 - well now i know what kind of person james is . its time to leave waffle

DeadBush - EiskalterFreund ik
niilas - I'm staff there, should I leave then?
niilas - ok just did
EiskalterFreund - ye i recommend you leave wafflehost
niilas - he also has AtomHost, it was delayed. I left it too
niilas - niilas AtomHost.eu
EiskalterFreund - hmm
doze - EiskalterFreund we have proof. let me send
doze - its not us ddosing. james is on mobile all day.
doze - it might be someone else how do u know its us?
DeadBush - doze cuz james was the one who threatened.
DeadBush - and plus if he can have money to own multiple hosts then he obv has money to pay someone to ddos. Or he is on pc
EiskalterFreund - yes
Chirag - doze You're lying. I have a plugin to see if user is on PC, browser, or mobile. James was always on PC.
doze - DeadBush no. i have access to his paypal
doze - Chirag I might not know.
EiskalterFreund - Our nodes are back online!!! We won the DDoS fight, by getting a high end DDoS protection (the DDoS is still happening but we can handle it now)!
Two - EiskalterFreund delete this, the ip is shown (unless you used a vpn/proxy)
_MrKnight_ - so  the end - james is a scum bag!
EiskalterFreund - Two yep i did lmao
EiskalterFreund - _MrKnight_ yes
Ash777 - @Jedrik can this thread get confirmed tag ?
Jedrik - Look, I understand that James is a bad person or whatever, I've seen all this go down, but the only things I got from this thread is y'all are mad at him for a threat that you can't prove he actually did it, and that he wanted to rebrand and delay atomhost. The only reason I'm confirming this is because of the "leaking your code" thing. Please don't have mini-discussions in the thread, it makes it harder to read + all thr screenshots are just the same thing.
Ash777 - thx
Ash777 - you should maybe give them a deadline to send proof about other claims then you can lock this thread and type a final message so its easy to understand who james is when someone check this thread later
doze - wow wtf james said he bought like few domains for him self for his sharex which total costs 7$ and now when i check my card it says dynadot took 7$ isn't this sus? - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-29/1622312599-528462-image.png
