Tomas - lmfao use your information for illegal activities
Juicy - Yeah. Bought a 2 VPS:es from this guy. (old company = EnderNodes)
33% Uptime, No Refunds, Sold my Data (apparently it was in his rules he wrote 2 days after my purchase.)
Also deleted BOTH VPS:ES WHEN I WAS USING THEM. Then said "I will recreate when I come home".

Like ...
don't. touch. this. guy.
Deleted User - any users of old alt us3 can confirm ^
onyx - ThatBad is this a joke host?
Deleted User - onyx no
onyx - damn i guess it really is ThatBad
Jedrik - well played, well played onyx
BabyAces - Okay, none of that is true. I promised 99% Uptime and he got 99% uptime. He charged back here is proof: (https://gyazo.com/48d881097a8f73a3f267e06cba06295d) Plus he told me to delete his vpses as well here is the other proof:  (He deleted the message). Plus it's not right for a owner of a hosting company to come into my discord and start spamming, "Client.AltHost.cloud". That just show's he's gready for members because its not growing. Plus threating to nuke all my hosting companys I work for here is proof (https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/790322715881635862/793952412310175744/Screenshot_2020-12-30-14-23-18.png?width=288&amp;height=513, https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/790322715881635862/793951222926934016/Screenshot_2020-12-30-13-32-15.png?width=288&amp;height=513,  https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/790322715881635862/793951222926934016/Screenshot_2020-12-30-13-32-15.png?width=288&amp;height=513, https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/790322715881635862/793951222780395550/unknown-1.png, https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/790322715881635862/793951222569631754/Screenshot_2020-12-30-13-39-14.png?width=288&amp;height=513, https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/790322715881635862/793951222301458472/Screenshot_2020-12-30-13-38-52.png?width=288&amp;height=513, https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/790322715881635862/793951221895135242/Screenshot_2020-12-30-13-54-59.png?width=288&amp;height=513)

 Than coming and my dms and start bragging about what they have. Don't they now I can get those locations as well??

BabyAces - And here is what sending packets is.
NoahvdAa - BabyAces Plus if you don't now the definition of sending packets is DDoxing FYI.

That's... not what packets are.
Detective_Alpha - xD sorry
Jedrik - Detective_Alpha Please refrain from posting unnecessary content that may be deemed as spam. (1/3)
Detective_Alpha - Jedrik sorry daddy :3
Detective_Alpha - I deleted it i think xD
EdwardSnowde - LOL, I would not trust this guy at all, I have ran 2 hosts with him, ( i am in the process of recovering one), and they all went down the shitter. So yeah.


(i might buy a vps from him)
BabyAces - That really doesn't matter. I don't own anything than come ask me for a VPS, that's stupid.
BabyAces - LOL, I would not trust this guy at all, I have ran 2 hosts with him, ( i am in the process of recovering one), and they all went down the shitter. So yeah.

^ Plus saying that and making me pay for everything.
Juicy - BabyAces 99% Uptime? Don't think so. You ran out of RAM everytime.
And when I bought the vps:es, you had no ToS. 2 minutes after when I contacted PayPal, you have the ToS, which says:
"No Refunds!!!".
I DMed Rocket saying "Can you remove my VPSes please?", and then he said that he wont delete it, and what happens 60 minutes after? My VPSes gets deleted because of "Rebuilding VPSes"! Like, I had an node and server information there...
