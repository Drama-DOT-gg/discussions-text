weedpl - Hey fellow drama wanting users,

Since some users who joined recently our Discord wanted to Drama.gg / Summerhoax us, we've decided to write a thread about how he falsed his information about us and how his host is operating. I've listed a few charges below:

Charges
Using Freenom
Using Contabo (This is not a crime, but considering the "DDoS shield" was claimed)
Falsing Information
Blackmailing
Having no Legal TOS
Exitscamming


Using freenom, I'd not need to explain this to much claims to have a good host whilst using a free .cf domain from Freenom. You can get those days a .xyz for maybe 1$ at Namecheap. 

Using Contabo whilst claiming they do have premium servers, we would not consider Contabo to be premium those days for enterprise users who are trusting a host to keep their sh*t alive.  You would need a sustainable source for your servers to be hosted on. 

Falsing information, he made a whole thread about a company called NYMetroCloud who he was claiming to are scammers, having no ToS, walking around with a stolen logo whilst the staff was linking all information required to this (e.g. TOS, Privacy Policy) This is a very young child who is trying with his pocketmoney to start a host, seems familiar doesn't it? After we did expose him for his charges he deleted the thread and instantly friended us on discord with saying "Am sorry". The kid does seems like he is 12 years old and firstly decided to apply at us for wanting to be a "developer / system administrator". When we said we did not search any he started to become toxic and then the thread was made of us "stealing logo's". 


He was on the same time blackmailing us for "having the stolen logo" as mentioned before, and also threatend to made a post on Drama.gg if we did not unban him for advertisements for his own hosts.



Whilst he claimed us to have no ToS, he has only provided us with a simple copied staff rules from another hosting company + discord rules who were claimed to be legal rules.

After this he instantly put his domain / panel offline, what we do call a simple exit scam when it get's to hard to defend yourself.

Now I do not want you guys to attack his host, let this be a lesson for the kid himself. I know the true power of drama.gg, but this is not needed today. 

Stay safe buds. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-04-23/1619220678-375267-image.png

Spikycord - We have a xyz domain bud
_Player1 - you really cant ban someone because of their status, its a status mate you cant control that, there are millions of servers and i dont see any other server worried about a small status. You shouldn't ban someone because of a status.

I would consider this false info if I was jedrick because you cant judge a host by there domain or there hosting provider.
Bxrk - bro one of them came in my host and posted drama.gg link to a dead thread that is just exposing the discord for having welcome channels in the general chat like bruv you all wannabe exposers
weedpl - _Player1 Due to your claims, with your staff I've made the few things about the Contabo and .cf problem. It's in general not a crime to use them as they are a nice cheap / free solution for personal use. But the claims who were made using this are not correct.
weedpl - Bxrk Yeah, there are stupid people on here ðŸ˜‚
Bxrk - @weedpl  do you have a discord?
AidanTheSister - weedpl You see weedpl its not very nice to talk about yourself are they the people going around typing "who" where it just isn't needed? Are they the ones that don't know how to run a proper host like you? Cause from what I have gathered your host sucks also your the one going on here rambling about things and aren't even correct about half of them.
AidanTheSister - weedpl May I see were in the discord TOS it says advertising in your status is bannable? Did you even give him a warning for his ban? See you talk all this sh*t and provide screenshots but can't even provide screenshots to show that this ban was needed.
AidanTheSister - weedpl 1 more thing about the "exitscamming" please don't talk unless you know the full story if you would like to be educated on what happened please feel free to DM me Aidan The Sister#1714
weedpl - AidanTheSister Intresting how you are defending a host who has been partly shutdowned. Where's your proof except for defeding your buddie's on drama.gg? I smell some altening here just to express your feelings. Please refrain from replying those kinds of stuff in the near future.
weedpl - AidanTheSister As you've joined the Discord the NYMetroCloud server was in her rights to permit / give out bans for those kinds of things.
PugRug - I like my uptime low, down low, down low.. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-07/1620421663-26060-image.png
AidanTheSister - weedpl xD idk what the fuck your talking about i didn't join your shit server xD
