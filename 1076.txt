HarryW - I came across this host named Mineton.Pro it seems to have their rules merged with their Terms Of Service

They are also using the Art Factory theme without giving any credit.

They also have no Privacy Policy! - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-10-08/1633729493-439809-image.png
Perny - Let me clearlify a few things, we have the rules in our Tos to make everything clearer. You only have to read the Tos. And we do have a Privacy Policy which is currently on our discord server. I will also be adding the credits back. Thanks for reminding me about that.
Jacob - Why ask if people are satisfied if your just gonna bribe people to say yes? - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-10-12/1634028754-583028-image.png
signyboi - Jacob Like yes you are bro. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-10-12/1634029030-324209-image.png
signyboi - I don't even know what Perny was trying to ask here. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-10-12/1634029076-111808-image.png
signyboi - Someone also DM advertised me the invite to this server (I wasn't in it at the time). I notified one of the staff members and at first they said something along the lines of "cant do nothing about that" (screenshot below) but I later convinced them to punish the DM advertiser. To my knowledge the DM advertiser has not been punished yet. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-10-12/1634029276-689086-image.png
