So these guys when  I joined their stormworks server they instantly banned me for not having the same name as discord on steam and I went like wtf, Even other people is mad about this, Please, If you play stormworks or if you got the chance to join their discord and tell them to piss off and not ban people that doesn't have same name as discord ingame, I will provide proof if I find some, The owner's name is Ancient Pottery
#9517 on discord.
If you are in their server leave, Please alright.
Take care,
Fedora.

GalaxyGamers1234Gam - Mortable Happened to me too I hate that Ancient keeps banning random people, I hope he looses all hes success and everyone realises that hes just a bitch trying to get people to help him when he does not support them back.
