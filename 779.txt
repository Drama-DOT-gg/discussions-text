X_Shadow_ - Welp, here we go again: kids trying to get their free hosting service. Actually "the best 24/7 free hosting". So if this is the "best" free hosting service, then any other host are too.

Basically in a few words: they think TOS is rules, no privacy policy whatsoever, the worst English possible (even tho I'm french and I do not have the best English in the world, I can tell you than their English is really something), you need to create tickets to have a server, stealing designs from QuackHost (the free hosting I made with J0SH, that got bought in the beginning of July) and finally, their servers are created manually, and sometimes actually he just creates servers in other free hosting and give them to people.
Here we go guys, this is the "best" free hosting service.

So, let's begin with.... Their TOS!!!! wait, their rules actually. Because yes, their "TOS" is just actually rules, and not even finished:



But, even before it became rules, it was just this:


Next up we have... no privacy policy!
No screenshots to show here, because there is umm... no privacy policy.

Now, the owner, VFarakiuD, has the worst English that I've ever seen, and want to actually make an English only discord server. Even tho I'm french and I make some spelling/grammar mistakes sometimes, I can tell you that his English his actually the worst I've ever seen:

and that's just one example...

Then, they are stealing design from QuackHost, which was an host josh and me made, that recently got sold. Even tho it got sold and I really do not care about theses designs, it's just to show you guys how lazy they are:
Their server:

QuackHost:


Their server:

QuackHost:


Well you get the point right...
But the good stuff is coming: this guy is manually creating servers, and just actually reselling game hosting from ectrix host.
Emerald Mike (the owner of ectrix) said it;


In conclusion, they are the dumbest kids that are trying to make a free hosting service. They don't know the difference between IP and hostnames, they think you can backup a Minecraft server only with the IP and so on.

If you guys have any other things to say about them, feel free to send it. A thread will be never enough for them. - https://cdn.shadowdev.ga/25746.png

EmeraldMike - Can vouch
Woodypop - Can vouch
Woodypop - The owner also admitted to not being professional after I asked why there was an invalid tos and no privacy policy - https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/367058290015731725/862800003822780426/Screenshot_20210708-135802_Discord.jpg
EmeraldMike - Funny thing is they wanted me to put ads on MY panel for THEIR host. I declined ofc.
Woodypop - The host is overall very unprofessional. Stealing designs from other hosts l. Just overall a host where I would stay away from.
Woodypop - I got muted for 12 hours because I was messaging in the general chat after the owner said he was going to sleep. The owner muted me for "Let me go to sleep properly"
The owner claims he is 15.
Yie - Woodypop a proper teenager doesn't sleep properly
X_Shadow_ - They said they took the designs on Google, but I can tell you guys that I made it all by myself, I'm pretty sure I streamed it in QuackHost while doing them in Photoshop. Pictures sent only in discord won't appear in Google Images. So we can say something more: they are lying
X_Shadow_ - They gave me staff for no reason, so I can tell you guys some things:

Their ticket panel is called "tucket" (English 100) 

and I saved all transcripts of tickets, so you guys can see what their tickets look like: very professional

they have voidnodes.ml domain
they got it from freenom 99%
it redirects to panel.ectrix.host 
lol
BlackCat - he also wanted to buy 1 day j4r from my host to "test my host"
BaconHead - This devx guy kept pinging josh and shadow and he kept asking them to help out in his host even after J0SH said "no" already. He's also dumb as fuck, and got mad at the base resources of centronodes. He didn't listen to the people in the quackhost server when they said that he'd be receiving extra resources to compensate for less resources than what he had in qh, but he didn't pay heed to that. All he kept saying was how his servers were ruined and he needed more.

Wow! Hiring random people in some hosting discord server! This is definitely not the proper way to recruit people.



How is your server being ruined? It's just that you are gonna have to manage with less resources and anyways, you're getting more for being a quackhost user. Besides, even 1mb is good enough and you should be grateful for it as it is being provided to you FOR FREE.


The guy doesn't even know what I'm saying, as his english is horrible.

Apparently, you're on life suppo- no ram support because you NEED your ram to live, just like the people that are facing oxygen shortage because of covid


Conclusively, Dev_X is pretty unprofessional and such people should not be hired. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-09/1625841240-834227-c4241ce2-ec44-4f2a-a35c-8e8f82964be0.jpg

Bartosz1 - Ah yes
1 message  = spam... hmm...
So you will get muted every one message on that discord server?

i think he rather meant flood - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-22/1626975344-881827-image.png
Wiktor - and he charges insane prices for cpus that dont even exist😂😂😂😂 - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-23/1627076845-19958-0835ac10-a0f7-422a-9722-05d6c0c66374.png
dchu096 - Indeed. But i think he means a 3900x ryzen 9 or a 3600 ryzen 5. But either way ryzen 5 3900 dont exist
Bartosz1 - dev x behaving like a dumbo and being unprofessional compilation
edit: i actually forgot to say he deleted the mute commands later lol - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-07/1628328444-646893-image.png
Dev_X - first off we are not scammers as the tags say cuz we didnt scam anything second off this has nothing to do with me as i dont own this host i only was meant to be an artist and make discord channels and stuff nothing else third:
and fourth dont come to our discord and send hate just bc we are unprofessional and dont have good nodes u can send hate elsewhere - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-07/1628331918-381500-image.png
Dev_X - Dev_X even if he copied from discord i didnt do anything im just saying what he said i just was there to help him with the discord design and help him hire ppl
Dev_X - and the rules have nothing to do with me i didnt write them i have nothing to do with the discord or the host as i said im just an artist and a channel maker nothing else i can help ppl in tickets but im just listening to farakiu but of course he got hacked or something or left the discord bc of u guys sending hate just bc of not having tos and pp instead of helping us and telling us how u send hate we just started openning this host even if im wrong this isnt my fault im just saying that farakiu posted the image not me im just an artist for the discord group i never was hired to pay for stuff i told him at the beginning im not paying for stuff if i dont get any money from the group or from u i just said im gonna send him links and let him buy the stuff we are going to be buying cheap stuff since we have to buy alot more things and to do that we have to save money, and of course why would u judge his english he isnt a english major he is from india its maybe hard for him, again i have nothing to do with this so stop saying its me
Dev_X - BaconHead yes it could be but still imagine how much we spent we are trying to get money while farakiu is working hard and we only get hate if i were him id probably quit at this point, he is overpaying it since he spent so much and he is making no profit and i understand what are ur opinions its prob why wont he just quit then well its his dream to make this host, so is ours
Dev_X - Bartosz1 yes it was a test i had to setup a mute role for carl bot
Dev_X - dchu096 his spelling might be off sometimes and as he said he has short memory term and maybe he thought that he remembers it and thought that it was named like that or something idk
Dev_X - J0SH that is true
Dev_X - J0SH he also told us to copy the qh miner code so we did that
Dev_X - Bartosz1 yeah he wanted me to login to his acc and setup a plugin for him he just made a domain so its easier to access for me or something idk but it was used to host his server
Dev_X - BaconHead yes i do regret saying i just got mad cuz i lost my boosts when i could have boost soome other server but still i was trying to hire ppl yes i admit i was but there is a reason since we are just starters we needed ppl to code stuff for us like bots, and websites and ur wrong about us begging j0sh, j0sh dm'ed me and he said it him self that he can code us a web i begged xshadow cuz i thought he coded the web, rn farakiu is paying j0sh the money so that j0sh can code the web for us
Dev_X - RusshvithSJ yes we dont and we dont need one rn why would we need a verify system? we can just literally ban those who are alts or bots or something idk why ur saying it but the reason is that we dont have our bot yet and we are trying to find ppl that can code a bot for us
Dev_X - RusshvithSJ arctic mad our miner and he told us to copy the code we didnt do anything wrong, we didnt wanna copy qh but arctic told us to do it so not our fault
Dev_X - X_Shadow_ no we didnt host the servers from ectrix i know that bc farakiu him self told me to login to his acc on ectrix i only saw one server which was his the reason he told me to login to his acc was bc to add hibernate plugin
Dev_X - X_Shadow_ also if ur asking me why it redirect from voidnodes to ectrix i have no idea but i think it was for me to access his server much easier
Dev_X - luffyy no not ur website just to buy off the theme of you cuz farakiu wanted it so i helped him with it thought we could we def would pay u much but still i regret this of course and im sorry but i didnt do this bc i wanted to it really was farakiu's decision
Dev_X - also we never said it was the "best" free 24/7 hosting we only said it was free 24/7
Dev_X - Before You Say Anything Read That. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-07/1628335521-971434-image.png
X_Shadow_ - He found the images on Google? Strange, I can't find them. Stop lying.

Void nodes is a bad host and you have to admit it, it got a bad start already, even tho you fixed some things you're still unprofessional, to understand one announcement you need to take 5 minutes until you understand it etc... Anyways, you're still copying everything I'm doing. For context, I did a bot for daily pictures of my cat as a joke with the Kittens group people, and strangely, dev_x doing daily pictures of his cat! Same colors, role structures... I mean it's not like I give a fuck about the cat thingy (it's literally on my GitHub) it's just that I find it kinda sad.

Anyways, that's all. I do not regret everything I said in this thread, and it's still true today.
Dev_X - Bartosz1 and yes i did delete the commands since it wasnt the bot commands channel, i do delete uneeded bot messages
Dev_X - Bartosz1 i do agree that this was a dumb descision and i hate dm advertrisers too but i didnt hire him, again it was farakiu and i do agree that he dosent deserve the co owner role as he didnt do anything what i mean by "anything" is he didnt invest, of course if he dosent wanna invest he could have send links to farakiu, i understand that he didnt wanna help us with this host and i know the reason its bc he owned a host back then and he was taking care of his host, again we have nothing to do with it this was farakiu.
Dev_X - X_Shadow_ first off i dont have a cat i have no idea wat u mean by roles i didnt create them i just created like miner role or something, i have no idea wat u mean by me being unprofessional im not a good artist i admit that but ok??
Dev_X - X_Shadow_ well im not lying thats what farakiu said if its false what i said im not lying its farakiu who's lying then since thats what he said.
Dev_X - X_Shadow_ and im not doing daily pics of my cat i do have a dog i only do bloopers of my dog
Dev_X - X_Shadow_ i never said it was "good" its just good for me cuz i dont judge shit like u guys
Dev_X - X_Shadow_ yes i do admit it has a bad start but we will fix that rn losty got scammed by a vps host and lost his money and now he cant pay with paypal so he cant pay j0sh at the current path
Dev_X - Dev_X cant pay j0sh = no website
Dev_X - X_Shadow_ and i didnt copy anything from u i just am a pepsi fan but of course im banned from the group fof no reason or something
Dev_X - Dev_X fack i misspelled im on my phone rn sorry if i misspell
Dev_X - X_Shadow_ "voidnodes is a bad host" THATS WHY IM ASKING EVERYONE TO STOP SENDING HATE IF ITS SO BAD THEN HELP US IMPROVE IT
Dev_X - X_Shadow_ it might be true but ppl dont understand THE GODDAMN REASONS
Dev_X - X_Shadow_ "creating tickets to get servers" yes where are we supposed to create servers for ppl if we dont have a web in general? For everyone to see the ip and the other stuff bruh.
Kowone - Dev_X For everyone to see the ip and the other stuff bruh.

isn't ip a public information? why do you need to hide it tho?
Kowone - i can tell you my ip rn if you want me to do so
Dev_X - Kowone ip to the server cuz maybe ppl dont want other unknown players to join their servers
Dev_X - Kowone no i dont need to see ur ip lmao
Kowone - Dev_X uhh, people could join the server IF ONLY they guessed THE RIGHT PORT.. have you forgotten about that shit?
Dev_X - Kowone ik but it will take more time figuring it out than just copy and pasting server adress from general
Dev_X - Kowone and at some point they will give up
Dev_X - Just saying its better to hide it in tickets
Kowone - Dev_X never gonna give you up? never gonna let you down? never gonna run around and desert you?
Dev_X - Thanks that ur never gonna let me down 🙂
Dev_X - X_Shadow_ and i dont regret proving u wrong
Dev_X - also id rather talk this stuff in discord private rn since im almost never online here since i dont give a damn anymore if u wanna talk friend me u can send screenshots here if u wanna "prove" me wrong Discord: Dev_X#2021 im gonna be off rn im gonna be probs mostly online on dc so add me if u rlly wanna talk
Dev_X - about this shit
Dev_X - if u dont want to talk about it in discord its fine but posting shit here wont do anything since u keep posting the same thing what i mean by that is "ThEy ClAiM ThAt RuLeS iS tOs AnD pP" again "they" its not me or anything its the one that posted or mostly farakiu that tells them/him to do that.
Dev_X - And sending hate just bc of some tos and pp which i have nothing to do with as the title says "farakiu and devx"
Dev_X - If u wanna continue this dm = add since u dont allow random dm in settings
Dev_X - or blocked me or smth idk
Dev_X - X_Shadow_ also the "daily pic thing" well i do send daily pics of my dog it isnt bc i want to or something its bc ash36 (staff member in discord) asks for them
Bartosz1 - Dev_X dude
the post you replied to has nothing to do with u
its about "smrplays", currently "smr"
Bartosz1 - Dev_X first of all
get any hekkin tos and pp
i already told u could take this thread as constructive criticism, not as "hate"
2nd: get nodes and stop reselling if you're still doing that
idk? some client panel?
BlackCat - simple thing:

dont fucking start host when you dont know how to do shit.  Frist you should learn how to manage everything then create host because you can just yeet the panel for accident and then everyones data is gone
Bartosz1 - BlackCat 
first you should learn how to install pterodactyl and use it, get any client and learn how to not resell 
kek
Dev_X - Bartosz1 title "farakiu devx
Dev_X - Bartosz1im not supposed to code or install ptero or anything
Dev_X - BlackCat im not here to code the panel or anything im just supossed to be an artist and dc channels maker
Dev_X - Bartosz1 the tos and pp isnt my doing
Dev_X - And im not gonna do it since its not my job
Dev_X - Bartosz1 im not reselling anything tf i just used to hire ppl for farakiu and stuff
Dev_X - Bartosz1 well the thing is im trying to tell the reasons and the hate is on dc, the title says "farakiu and devx" i didnt do anything
Dev_X - Bartosz1 i just answered the co owner thing just ignore the rest
Bartosz1 - Dev_X 
bruh
title contains "VoidNodes", i believe
so
we can discuss everything about voidnodes here right?
including its staff team?
this thread's title isnt just 2 nicknames lmao
whats your logic
Bartosz1 - Dev_X ok?
Bartosz1 - Dev_X 
ok
but
u can improve from hate i believe 
hate can be taken as
CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM
no matter where its posted
think a bit pls
BaconHead - Dev_X Then first learn about a host instead of starting a host all of a sudden
Dev_X - Bartosz1 titles contains: "voidnodes / farakiu /devx" title says my name for no reason like i didnt do anything all the questions are literally answered
Dev_X - Bartosz1 yeah? i dont rule what u say or what u discuss
Dev_X - Bartosz1 no i cant and even if i can im not gonna do it i was just hired as an artist for the dc server and logo and etc and i do agree that i dont deserve the executive rank and ppl think that im here managing the fcking panel or the website or some shit i said it so many times that im just an guy that does logos and dc i might be a real executive later on ill think about it
Dev_X - BaconHead I DIDNT EVEN FCKING START THE HOST WTF?!?!??!
Dev_X - EmeraldMike also "they" it wasnt me or anish it was probs farakiu so STOP SAYING IT WAS "they" cuz we didnt do anything if someone did it it isnt our fault
Bartosz1 - rly pog tos - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-14/1628940668-172543-obraz.png

Dev_X - that was just revenge
BlackCat - what about that
BlackCat - its just a ruby code lmao
Dev_X - thats the same thing as me saying "wat about wat i sent the epic code" you know exactly what
Dev_X - BlackCat no thats more like voidnodes hate
Dev_X - also did u not read the rules? and u send that "ruby code" in general and i deleted that if other ppl would have seen it u would have been banned be happy that i didnt ban u i just muted u
BlackCat - i did send it to our dms bruh - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-14/1628944499-365076-image.png
BlackCat - u are the guy who sent it to general 🤦 - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-14/1628944725-521719-image.png
Dev_X - BlackCat i just sent the reason cuz bartosz wanted me to unmute u
Dev_X - BlackCat u did also send it in voidnodes general
BlackCat - Dev_X proof
Dev_X - I deleted it ._.
Dev_X - BlackCat i dont need to send u proof u know u did it u can lie but u cant run away from sins.
BlackCat - show at audit logs at u deleted it and date when u deleted it
Dev_X -  - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-14/1628968004-953910-screenshot-20210814-190605.png
Dev_X - no proof there
BlackCat - u did ask question "is voidnodes trash" and i voted yes and i sent screenshot of every1 saying yes and talked about it
Dev_X - BlackCat yeah?
Dev_X - BlackCat and u did not talk about it u just sent more hate to it
Dev_X - X_Shadow_ also about that tos thingy i have one more thing to say about that: our discord ISNT even finished we just opened this discord for ppl to chat and tell us what to improve of course we are going to do the tos thing once losty comes back or something but please dont send any hate just tell us nicely what to improve. (Sad story: plz xshadow dont send hate to us when i first saw u joined i freaked out i thought ur gonna be nice to us not sending hate and drama and stuff also can i plz be in pepsi group cuz i miss pepsi pics). you dont have to dont start drama about this im just saying that our discord isnt finished, sorry for the "qh donator and free plan image"
Dev_X - even tho it wasnt me
Dev_X - https://drama.gg/d/906-xshadow-bartosz1-blackkitten
anishbanerjee12 - Hey me anish as most of you.. want to inform you all that voidnodes is just a scam...I got ban as I came to know that losty the new owner is farakiu himself....devx is just a nice guy he doesn't know anything...so pls help me to stop this scam
anishbanerjee12 - Devx has also left voidnodes ..he text me that he don't care of it anymore
