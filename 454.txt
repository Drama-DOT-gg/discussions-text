TheMGDEV - Hello, I'm not here to start some bullshit fight, I'm just here to warn you not to use LeetNodes. Just last night (May 4th), they posted an announcement with two emails they had the domain censored out, however, they did something like thisisarandomemail@#####.com, so I easily found out that it was a gmail domain. I told one of the staff that it was very VERY insecure to do that. They then deleted my message, so I made a new one saying that I'll be collecting data on them for, well, this post. They decided to ban me. $MoneyBoi$#0999 is the owner. LeetNodes used to be known as SakuraNodes are something. 

Anyways, like I said in the beginning, not here to cause a bullshit fight, just here to let you know that LeetNodes is very very insecure, and you shouldn't use them.
Knifeworm - TheMGDEV Hello TheMGDEV i would like to inform you if u actully looked at the email it was so########@#####.c## so if u think we would acctually expose an email its self then you are wrong.
Bruhmeme - https://prnt.sc/12iowb6 The email are blurred and I saw what you put in chat "I am watching for the next few months" to a staff member, so they obviously gonna ban you for saying weird shit like that
TheMGDEV - Bruhmeme Hello, I'm glad that you updated it to be more secure, but as you can see, the message was edited, which means that at first it wasn't secure, and it was just the email@####.com, that's what I saw until you banned me for no reason.
Knifeworm - TheMGDEV Im sorry to say the edit was him editing a spelling mistake he did. And u have no evidence of the orignal unedited post.
So you can't backup that he edited it to change the email. He changed a spelling mistake.
TheMGDEV - Knifeworm Okay, then what was the reason for my ban unless you didn't want me to talk, and get more evidence?
Knifeworm - TheMGDEV I have all the evidence in the world and so has @Bruhmeme and the ban was for the creepy comment you made which was "I will be watching you for a few months." which if you ask me is pretty creepy.
TheMGDEV - Again, in the original post, that was to get more evidence on why you shouldn't use LeetNodes. If you read the whole message you would know this, but some retarded staff decided to ban me.
Knifeworm - TheMGDEV A: He is not retarded. B: I have worked my whole life trying to make leetnodes as secure as i can. And C: He was just helping me migrate everyone to the new database.
TheMGDEV - @Jedrik Can you mark this as locked or something? And Knifeworm If you read the first fucking sentence, I said that I'm not here to start a bullshit fight, which you are trying to do.
Bruhmeme - TheMGDEV there‚Äôs was a spelling mistake so they updated it, they banned you for saying ‚ÄúI am going to watch you for the next few months", it is just plain creepy and weird that you would say that. So they banned you.
Bruhmeme - TheMGDEV by posting here and saying bullshit you are going to start a fight no matter what lmao
TheMGDEV - Bruhmeme Mate, we don't need a copy and paster to copy what someone else said and paste it in ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Also your owner is pretty toxic https://gyazo.com/593afa32e0cee1065dce45e29a3d8f21
Knifeworm - TheMGDEV Xd im saying that because u have no evidence
at all. I ain't toxic first off. and second off. Get more evidence before you create a drama.gg post.
Bruhmeme - TheMGDEV just looks like he is defending his service.
TheMGDEV - Bruhmeme And how is that? Oh no! I used a bad word, and that's causing a fight? Lmao
Bruhmeme - TheMGDEV where did a copy and paste? I am just saying what happened
Knifeworm - TheMGDEV You are legit posting bullshit with no evidence what do you expect
Bruhmeme - TheMGDEV if you say bullshit as in you say complete lies your going to start a fight
