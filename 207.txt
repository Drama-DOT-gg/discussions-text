Vanquish - I found this hosting provider called District Node, I asked if they're using WHMCS the CEO said yes, I asked to see the receipt he claimed to have and he banned me.

LanceUS - Hello,

Made an account to respond to this ridiculous post that is invalid and gives my company a bad image, therefore I banned the conspirators of the people who made this post.

Yes, my account was terminated so that is correct my account was made 3 days ago, I had an account back in 2015 before the current discord account that I currently main in.

My explanation to your "blackmail" is that we use Dedicated Servers instead of hosting multiple different Virtual Private Servers for my clients, we only have one node as we are a small company and all of the servers are hosted off a Dedicated Server. This gives us better redundancy and reliability as we don't have to focus on managing different server nodes.

For WHMCS License Verification. Which is also incorrect and and photoshopped.

Check our license validation here.

Hi there Lance,

We're not here to blackmail you, we are here to simply inform others about hosting providers that are considered suspicious, fraudulent or anything of the sort.

The way you handled the situation was not in any way professional what-so-ever.
You resorted to banning myself and others for asking about the license verification.
You purged the chat multiple times without reason.

In terms of the WHMCS License, it does appear to be valid now however your method of handling the situation was very poor as stated above. It was not previously showing as properly valid the image was not photoshopped.

For this part of your reply, and I quote "we only have one node as we are a small company and all of the servers are hosted off a Dedicated Server." end quote. We understand District Node is a newer provider.

If you cannot handle backlash for your actions, you should not be running a host and I quote, "Made an account to respond to this ridiculous post that is invalid and gives my company a bad image" end quote.

Kind Regards,
Vanquish
LanceUS - Hello,

Next time, please reach out to me personally before coming in my server and shit posting about everything such as my Terms of Service and posting this thread. 

I was currently eating at the time and if you didn't have time to wait for me to finish, yet you guys are very impatient to the matter and kept asking me if it's verified or valid or not, yes everything is valid and done by the book. 

Also, if you don't like anything about our service, our Terms of Service for example. Then that's your opinion and I'm sorry you don't like how I made my Terms of Service, but that's just how I made it.

Hopefully people does know how invalid this thread is, as everything is verified.

Sincerely,
LanceUS

Vanquish - Mason69 okay
eraters - I removed nulled as we were proven it was not, and hilarious performance as you don't own a product, so you cannot rate the performance.
Vanquish - eraters It was unverified, but it seems to be verified now. fair though
Vanquish - Bad Support shouldn't of been removed
eraters - I am going to lock this thread as we don't have evidence other than him purging the channels and an unverified license (which is now licensed.)

If you wish to reopen this, please dm me on discord (eraters#5859) with more evidence.


Thanks,

Kindly, choke on deez nuts. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-03-01/1614628642-231979-image.png
Two - no idea what you mean authorized, i see this too - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-03-01/1614629288-373093-image.png
Tomas - Normally it would show a licence error here: https://districtnode.com/billing/admin/
But it doesn't, so there isn't really a way of getting out of that one
Vanquish - Tomas N U L L E D
Tomas - Vanquish we pay for whmcs, our licence provider says we won't appear as verified though - not nulled!!!!
FatGrizzly - Tomas Normally it would show a licence error here: https://districtnode.com/billing/admin/

Not necessarily, using a nulled whmcs(editing the license.php file) internally and externally using the good old HostGator Trick makes the installation verified, but still its nulled internally
Tomas - FatGrizzly If it's nulled it has a high probability of never showing the "Invalid Licence" screen
FatGrizzly - Tomas If it's nulled it has a high probability of never showing the "Invalid Licence" screen

Performing an upgrade/update brings that Invalid License Screen even tho if its nulled. and people just replace the license file and you are good to go
Tomas - FatGrizzly Fair enough but if it's an upgrade you can check the licence checker page and it should still appear verified
FatGrizzly - Tomas Nope, just did an upgrade today on a SECRET DOMAIN and its not verified rn.

will dm you if needed - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-03-02/1614675255-991484-image.png
Tomas - FatGrizzly That shouldn't happen if it's a real &amp; active licence
Abooz - I don't get the thing, if you are poor get a job and once you have the money start a host.
WHMCS is not even that expensive.
Ryder - hm? - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-03-10/1615377464-630916-image.png
XInterverse - Vanquish From what you say, they sound a little bit as worse as TreeTopHost and their staff (but TreeTopHost is the worst)
Vanquish - Ryder I guess it varies by day? I mean it was 100% unverified if u check here https://winterhoax.is-shit.xyz/districtnode.mp4
