dchu096 - ⚠️ If you are from wisp please treat this as a feedback not as a complaint. cuz if i mark you a low star review on trustpilot it will show so bad for you

Wisp game panel, you might have heard of, a panel that is hosted in the cloud. Trying out and bought 3x 10 dollar + enterprise plan licenses for 3 nodes. No problem. Node 1 is transferred over nice and quick. Awesome! but for my singapore 2 it didnt go through, opened a support ticket and served by Jack Jenkins . he replied in like less then 10 minutes, and i futher on replied in the next 2 minutes and now waiting for 18 hours with no reply.



i dont see this as enterprice support. More like community support.

should you still go for wisp

If you know how to deal with errors yourself, this will be surely a great choice to go. But if you don't...  oh well - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-15/1626385104-458154-nqkemz2xjr.png

Toki0179 - dchu096 This is why you be patient and don't just instantly call their support bad.
SamCoThePug - I use wisp, their support is actually very fast and helpful. I always ask in their discord first and then email them.
Iceey - ... what
HitClick - I use wisp, for my hosting company. Great support always happy to help, if you have a small issue i suggest asking in their discord. But other than wisp is great for new hosts starting up, that dont know how to install pterodactyl.
Triassic - HitClick You shouldn't be doing hosting if you don't know how to setup Pterodactyl honestly.
Jamie_ - Triassic I agree but this is not the reason people like me use it.
HitClick - Triassic I do know how, but i like what wisp offers for my clients.
