samxd - Update: USER HAS BEEN BANNED!
Nova - what-
PugRug - Nova just a bunch of idiots
Jxck_KV - PugRug So you included?
Nova - PugRug o-o
samxd - Nova lmao he's just angry because he got caught:
operating illegally (claiming he's a legal entity without actually being a legal entity)
being a skid (stealing shit from github)
trying to ddos people using a free booter
being annoying asf and harassing everyone
Dviih - I almost never login to drama but i logged just to vote to that lmao
PugRug - @Nova 
Do not believe a word he says, he is a liar.
Jxck_KV - samxd He obviously uses stressthem.to !!
samxd - PugRug you cheeky cunt, how dare you, you know for a fact you've done all of this + more. If it's not true, why were you banned?
mtt - PugRug hes just speaking facts stfu
PugRug - samxd reported you to discord they're taking action soon.
Nova - PugRug didn't you try to blackmail me once 😤
mtt - PugRug awwwwww ur so mad u got caught
PugRug - Nova no
samxd - PugRug Not a problem big man 👍
PugRug - Jxck_KV i do not, no.
Nova - PugRug I like your pfp
PugRug - Nova thanks 🙂
PugRug - samxd mk, just got the 26th email sent!
Nova - PugRug yw, its the only positive thing about you I can say, can't think of anything else
PugRug - Nova : )
Nova - PugRug : )
samxd - PugRug Not a problem. I've just about finished writing my reports to:

ICO
Hetzner Abuse Department 
Namecheap Abuse Department 
Ionos Abuse Department 

If the ICO decide to take action against you, you could potentially serve jail time due to what you have done with my user data.
PugRug - Nova : )
Nova - samxd isn't he a minor-
Nova - it really depends where he lives
PugRug - Nova 14
Nova - PugRug so then it wouldn't be jail, most likely juvi, again- depends where you live
samxd - Nova Yes he is, and he's operating his services highly illegally. He's disclosed publicly that he's 14 years of age. I'm 15, and I clearly know right from wrong, so he should too. I will be submitting the reports now. 🙂
PugRug - samxd ur friend told me your location dumb ass
Nova - why would you think of doing illegal stuff at the age of 14 on a social media app- 

PugRug
PugRug - Nova i didnt do anything, nor illegal stuff.
Nova - samxd then why did he say this
samxd - PugRug I didn't state anything about a location. I have signed up on puggo.host previously to check it out. No friend of mine has my current IP address, as I have it change everytime I restart my router. Therefore, you've clearly pulled this from your database. I'll be requesting logs from Sloth to submit as part of my ICO report. I don't care what you have to say at this point, the reports are being submitted. If you've done nothing wrong, why are you worrying?
PugRug - Nova he is lying
samxd - Nova The user is very poorly trying to cover his tracks, but it's failing. Do not listen to any blatant lies coming from him. You can ask the rest of the community, and they will also agree with my statements as they're true.
Jxck_KV - samxd  agreed.
PugRug - @Nova Do not listen to him at all, he is a liar.
Nova - PugRug I kinda believe sam more then you, since he hasn't tried to blackmail and has actually been nice to me
PugRug - Nova he is lying i didnt do anythign
PugRug - @samxd  Have fun, you're not gonna get anywhere with those fake reports.
Nova - PugRug then how did his location get leaked- (or IP)
Sloth - I banned you from the Discord and you continue to annoy everyone here. What are you even trying to prove rn? What is the point of this conversation?
Jxck_KV - I see PugRug's timbers have been shivered. He is literally shitting bricks rn
PugRug - Nova his friend told me
Nova - 😳
PugRug - and he said it in a gc before
Nova - PugRug proof?
samxd - PugRug If I'm a liar, why would the rest of the community agree with me? I have factual evidence to backup all of my claims which have been provided previously in the Discord server. If you're not a scumbag, PROVE that you are a legal entity, that you can program, that you're not toxic, that you're not violating PayPals AUP by selling Minecraft Products directly, that you didn't DDoS me, that you didn't pull my IP from your database. Either way, all reports have been submitted now.
PugRug - Nova i'll be bluring names i do not want sam being mad at his friend
Nova - PugRug ok-
PugRug - we are so sad rn
PugRug - we are gonna have to shut down  🙁&amp;(&amp;(&amp;(
    
))))
Sloth - We all hate you, get that into your tiny fucking head, we HATE you, I banned you for constantly annoying everyone and making everything about yourself when it really isn't, and even then you come in here with alts, and dm people with screenshots of the conversation just so they post it in the chat and you once again fiddle your way into the discussion. Then Sam finally makes a poll, so the hatred is quantifiable, and you... create a poll back at him, in which you were the only voter. That's sad. Anyways, if you continue to be a terrible person on the site, I'll delete your accounts. Sloth out
samxd - Sloth I absolutely agree with this.
Nova - Thats just sad
Nova - kthxbye this is none of my business, I believe sam, puggo you're an idiot
Sloth - @PugRug just got called an idiot by an American, now that's an accomplishment.
PugRug - Nova at least i dont date lamaker 🍔🍔
PugRug - Sloth dont care
samxd - PugRug You've really run out of comebacks at this point, haven't you? Pathetic. Get a life.
Nova - PugRug at least I don't pull peoples IP from my database (don't have one, to clarify that)
PugRug - Nova you dont have an ip pogger
PugRug - lol imagine getting mad cuz puggo host is doing good
Nova - PugRug Imagine saying puggo host is good 🤮
Jxck_KV - PugRug read what you just said, rephrase it, and come back later.
PugRug - Nova imagine dating falixnodes owner 🤮
samxd - PugRug Mad because your service is doing good? What? Have you been sniffing glue? Everybody here agrees with my statements + there's factual evidence to back it all up. 

I think it's about time you get a fucking grip. Grow some balls and move on.
Sloth - At least she's dating someone, unlike your lonely ass
PugRug - samxd have you been on to many fruit shoots?
PugRug - imma quit life after nova saying she doesnt have an ip
PugRug - 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Jxck_KV - He hasn't infact, you've sniffed too much fucking glue dude, calm your ass down and close your stupid "free hosting"
samxd - PugRug Stealing my line that I used in a group chat about two weeks ago. Pathetic.
Nova - bruh when did I ever say that
PugRug -  - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-13/1620941019-209308-image.png
Nova - Sloth  *dated
SamCoThePug - @Sloth just delete puggos account already, all he is doing is causing shitty little arguments.
PugRug - samxd LMAO THAT SHIT IS ALL OVER THE INTERNET
Nova - had to point that out ^^
Nova - SamCoThePug agreed
Sloth - No, I wanna see this shit. I have a free day and I'm gonna enjoy these doritos.
PugRug - @Nova  go to fucking mc donalds
SamCoThePug - Nova like why does he even bother with his hosts, their like destined to fail.
samxd - Puggo I'd shut up, you probably have a boyfriend
Nova - SamCoThePug Fr, he just hasn't faced reality
SamCoThePug - Nova yeah lmfao, he needs to grow up
PugRug - samxd shut the fuck up
Nova - PugRug I'm sorry, did you just insult my mcdonalds? At least I can afford to eat it, you barely have a cent in your bank account
Sloth - I love how everyone brings up valid arguments and you just sit here with terrible comebacks, if you can even consider em' that.
Nova - SamCoThePug I know right, no one wants to hear an 8 year old argue with the adults here
samxd - PugRug Shut your fucking trap now you tosspot pinheaded wanker. How dare you talk to me in such a manor? Sit down
jeekie - PugRug I hope this is a joke with the site you had, it's worse than primesrvs and mine
Nova - @PugRug Everyone here hates you? why try?
PugRug - jeekie welp someone figured it out? who told him?
PugRug - Nova u too 💑💑💑💑💕💕😍😍😍💑🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟
Sloth - Puggo, anything you wanna say in your defense to what sam pointed out earlier? You don't appear to really respond to anything at the moment.
Nova - PugRug no one said you could speak, raise your hand, thats the point you've come to
PugRug - Nova did you just say...?
PugRug - Shut yo skin tone chicken bone google chrome no home flip phone disowned ice cream cone garden gnome extra chromosome metronome dimmadome genome full blown monochrome student loan indiana jones overgrown flintstone x and y hormone friend zoned sylvester stallone sierra leone autozone professionally seen silver patrone head ass tf up
Jxck_KV - https://prnt.sc/12lbeck lol
Blue_ - Puggo shouldn't be banned
PugRug - Blue_ yessir
Sloth - Blue_ okay, person who got asked by Puggo to come on the site to defend him.
SamCoThePug - Blue_ hey puggo alt, how are ya?
Blue_ - I don't see the problem
Jxck_KV - Blue_ Say that again?

After all the shit he has done to Drama.gg you still think he deserves a chance here, fuck off mate.
samxd - @PugRug Why haven't you responded to any of my previous questions? Is it because you know everything said was true?
PugRug - SamCoThePug LMAOOOOOO
Sloth - Blue_ Retarded 8 year old british kid with attention issues and problems socializing, ruining this community?
Verse - Sloth wat. I just got to this thread wat is this about again besides banning puggo?
Blue_ - I don't know why you brought yourself up in this.
But ok
SamCoThePug - Verse just go tell your soulmate to fucking leave this community and never come back.
PugRug - guys my ip is  1.1.1.1
jeekie - I'd like to interrupt this thread to remind everybody about keeping healthy.

Make sure to:

Eat your 5 a day
Get enough sleep
Drink enough water
Eat healthy food (Chocolate is not healthy BTW)
Don't date online and then breakup 10 minutes later
Don't open joke companies so people shit on you and then you get the depressed
Do your school work, it's more important than your online life
Education &gt; a company that has a 90% chance of failing 

Thanks for reading
Blue_ - PugRug  sick IP
Nova - PugRug stfu you fucking fat ass kid who tries to act cool all the time, what gives you the right to fucking say that after you had the nerve to pull someones IP up from your database, how fucking dumb can a person be to do that? oh right, you. You're that dumb, pathetic
Verse - Nova woah, we gotta calm down here! I dont even know what is going on, can anyone tell me?
Nova - Blue_ oh its an alt, so sad, mad because you're getting gang up that you had to create an alt to back up yourself? proves my point of how pathetic someone as you can be.
Mythical - What is happening jeez so much hatred lok
samxd - Verse Please skim-read through the posts on this thread, it'll help you grasp a general concept of what is happening here. Your friend, Puggo, has partaken in many illegal activities. This has contributed to the reason of a permanent punishment for the user.
Blue_ - Nova who's alt
Blue_ - Nova do you know not what friends are? The fuck
Verse - Nova but blue is not an alt? He was my friend from 1 year ago, I just invited him to this thread lmao.
samxd - Blue_ No need for such profane and vulgar language. Calm down.
Nova - Blue_ don't act fucking dumb you fag, oh wait.. I forgot, you are dumb, my bad.
Mythical - Nova is pissed rn
KoldEnvy - Nova Were you born this stupid or did you take lessons?
samxd - Mythical I wonder why.. possibly why.. hmm.. it's really not coming to me? I'm not sure..
Blue_ - Nova Your dumbass said you don't have an ip, now your out here calling other people here dumb
omg
Nova - KoldEnvy No, I think I just have a brain, unlike you
Mythical - Bro why is everyone so fuckin pissed
samxd - KoldEnvy Firstly, learn some respect you fucking tosspot. Secondly, who the fuck are you? Can clearly tell you haven't read the thread
Mythical - What happened?
Blue_ - I cam here to stop from puggo getting banned and I getting called an alt?
PugRug - Nova 
ooooo year 3 comebacks 🥶
PugRug - Blue_ they call any of my friends alts
samxd - Mythical Please skim-read through the posts on this thread, it'll help you grasp a general concept of what is happening here. Puggo, has partaken in many illegal activities. This has contributed to the reason of a permanent punishment for the user.
Nova - Blue_ bro, I have a fucking ip? when did I ever say I didn't? IF I did I probably just miss Interpreted because grammar is fucking dumb, I'm sorry you don't have the common sense to think of a plain old of making a mistake
Blue_ - Does that mean everyone against puggo is an alt then if everyone for puggo is
Blue_ - Nova - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-13/1620942565-894989-image.png
PugRug - Blue_ 😂😳
Mythical - samxd thanks for the perspective
PugRug - Mythical he is lying btw
samxd - Blue_ It's the sad fact that Puggo has invited his friends outside of the Drama.gg community to come here and defend him (they're doing a very poor job by the way).
Nova - Blue_ oh, so you come in having your account created about 20 minutes ago in the middle of a conversation of where puggo is getting gang up on, if your not an alt I still don't have to apologize for you backing up someone who doesn't have a fucking brain
KoldEnvy - Blue_ she doesn't have one because she lives in the dumpster can
samxd - Blue_ She is clearly stating that she doesn't have a database? Are you on some sort of drug?
Mythical - PugRug o
Nova - Blue_ I WAS TALKING ABOUT A DATABASE, I DONT HAVE A FUCKING DATEBASE?
Blue_ - Nova you can stop copy and pasting from google now its fine
PugRug - hey sam remember that time you tried to token log me?
Blue_ - Nova how do you "don't a database"?
samxd - PugRug Never happened. Sufficient evidence WITH message links is required, otherwise the evidence is void as screenshots can easily be manipulated.
Mythical - Blue_ Only thing shes copying is a life so she can keep one. Fuckin hell
Verse - Mythical ye, a lot of people in this thread are mad XD.
Blue_ - Mythical ayeeeeeeeee
Mythical - Verse lol
Nova - Blue_ Oh I'm so sorry I offended your 8 year old attitude, again, you don't have the common knowledge to think I just miss typed it
samxd - Blue_ She clearly made a simple error, you can understand what she meant. She doesn't have a database, as she doesn't require one for anything. It's nice and simple, not a hard concept to grasp.
Blue_ - Nova you were out here questioning my grammar? I don't see the problem
Nova - samxd  fr
Mythical - I know everyone is pissed but can i just say @Blue_ is the biggest fuckwit here
Verse - Nova I'm sorry for my friend's Blue's attitude.
PugRug - remember the time when you tried token logging me, and then you deleted all the messages because you was scared of getting banned - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-13/1620942868-849039-308bef1f-df08-4316-93ba-3a8bfc3f7253.png
Nova - Verse someone has to apologize for it
samxd - PugRug Clearly manipulated. As I stated before, could you please provide message links? If not, the evidence is void, as the messages do not exist, and are not stored anywhere.
PugRug - samxd as i said you deleted all the messages
Verse - Nova haha. Could you tell me what Puggo has done before? I can't be bothered to read this whole thread :/.
Nova - PugRug Yeah, I'm sure he did
samxd - PugRug The messages never existed in the first place. You cannot prove this without message links. Therefore, your "evidence" is clearly invalid. Thank you for understanding.
Nova - Verse 
operating illegally (claiming he's a legal entity without actually being a legal entity)
being a skid (stealing shit from github)
trying to ddos people using a free booter
being annoying asf and harassing everyone
(sam said this)
Verse - Nova I understand this, I am not trying to go on sides here but did sam say this with valid evidence or biased opinions and thoughts?
PugRug - Nova vanquish gave me it lmao 

and it’s just a coming soon page for my development stuff
PugRug - Nova never ddosed anyone sam is trying to fuck my reputation
samxd - Verse Yes. The user has violated many laws and acts. This includes, but isn't limited to:
Breaking data protection laws (pulling IP's from his own database, and sending them into a public chat)
Attacking my personal network to cause a denial of service 
Claiming his company is a legal entity without actually being registered
Harassing many users on this platform to a point where even the owner wants the user banned
Stealing his code from github (skidding it)
PugRug - @Verse had written my legal docs
samxd - Nova Oops, didn't see this before I posted my message.
PugRug - ah yes "“stealing " code from github is illegal
Nova - Verse I'm not explaining the whole story, but I believe sam more then puggo because puggo has tried to blackmail me before, sam can show his proof (if he has). Puggo doesn't have proof that he hasn't done these things, and is making obvious excuses
Verse - samxd oh yea I wrote the legal docs but I might have messed up somewhere. I will fix that right now. Thank you for informing me.
samxd - PugRug Never stated that specific action was illegal. It's just unpractical, and a lot of code on there isn't suitable for production environments. This has clearly been shown by your main site, as you have random tags scattered that serve no purpose.
Woultz - poopy farts
PugRug - ah sam sam, you are lucky that i didn’t screenshot the times when you said the n word to me and deleted it?? and remember when you kept threatening me to ddos my network and my sites?? remember when you threatened to send bombs to my house?? 

ah shit sorry you must have forgot silly you
samxd - PugRug That never happened, ever. You have no evidence, therefore cannot prove anything. Your statement is invalid.
PugRug - samxd you deleted all the messages and i did not screenshot any because you threatened me if i did i would get bombed and swatted
samxd - PugRug Incorrect. Never happened. No evidence to back up your claim.
PugRug - samxd  you deleted all the messages and i did not screenshot any because you threatened me if i did i would get bombed and swatted

maybe read next time!!
samxd - PugRug Incorrect. Maybe learn to read yourself. No evidence = never happened.
PugRug - samxd  you deleted all the messages and i did not screenshot any because you threatened me if i did i would get bombed and swatted
Nova - PugRug thats kinda just ridiculous..
Nova - If you have no evidence why even try making a claim he did that? its going to make you look like you're lying no matter what you do
Verse - Nova I'm pretty sure people don't casually just send bomb and swat threats, but on the low chance, it could be true because of threats.
samxd - PugRug Stop pasting the same statement over and over. I never made such claims, and never would, Furthermore, you have no evidence. Therefore your point is automatically invalid. I do not wish to continue this discussion with you tonight, as you are running out of things to say, and appear to be just pasting the same statement over and over. Thank you for understanding - Sam.
samxd - This post has had over 200 posts in just 2 hours. That's a lot of posts for this topic. Either way, I'm leaving this here for now. Thank you to all members who participated in this thread. Goodnight - Sam.
Nova - I can agree with sam, this conversation has just gotten ridiculous at this point, you barely have anything to say anymore because you know it's true what we have said. The claims you're making about sam are just invalid, you have no evidence therefore your claim is irrelevant. Next time don't be be a fucking dumbass puggo, no one here likes you. Nova signing off
jeekie - 🤨
PugRug - it’s pretty funny how everyone is believing sam not me sam has not provided any proof all he had provided is statements i have provided screenshots messages etc.. and you are all believing sam...
PugRug - i have actually provided proof all that sam has done is provide statements
samxd - https://puggo.host - the links on site do not resolve to your actual legal documents. This is also highly illegal and will be added to the ICO report.

The terms of service which you did provide in the Discord server was invalid, as you were claiming to be a legal entity when you weren't actually a legal entity.

The logs of you stating you had my IP (pulled from your database) are in the drama.gg Discord server, which I can have @Sloth pull.

The website for Puggo Development is clearly skidded, as many people have found that horrific looking site on Github.

Lastly, you annoy the fuck out of everyone here. You always make everything about you, and act so retarded. Let this be a life lesson. Learn, and move on.
Tomas - PugRug Why would Sam want your scrawny ass account
Nova - Tomas fr
PugRug - Tomas sam tried so hard for real

and i love how you're all dodging what i said
PugRug - samxd The website for Puggo Development is clearly skidded, as many people have found that horrific looking site on Github.

kk
Nova - PugRug I'm just going to point this out you're all he actually has a decent amount of people on his side, yet for you its pretty much Me, myself, and I
PugRug - Nova yes, yes. believe that person that has provided 0 evidence everything he has said is statements which are not true.
Nova - PugRug Yes, I would rather believe the one who hasn't tried to blackmail me
PugRug - Nova never tried to black mail you idiot
Nova - PugRug bruh.
samxd - Nova Apologies for the way Puggo has spoken to you. He's just a bit of a retard. As seen above, I've provided all necessary evidence 🙂
Mythical - everyone here is retarded jesus christ.
BxdrLOL - Puggo should be banned from Drama.gg as this is my opinion.
Yes i know that i have done bad things as well alright but not everyone learns from mistakes but i did. Some people just make mistakes and keep acting tuff while not wanting to face it or admit it which is the wrong way. Puggo has done many bad things to many users such as being very toxic, nuking and raiding servers to even token logging users. I believe that these actions are not acceptable and do not think that a community like this would like to have such a person in it. 
If you wanna start an argument then go ahead.
samxd - BxdrLOL Yes, absolutely correct. Thank you for your input.
BxdrLOL - samxd That was truly what i thought about Puggo.
bad - should i expose puggo in front of 1.8k people lmao
bad - completed
CAT-GANG - yeah puggo should have to be banned from drama.gg
VEX - BxdrLOL 
You gain my respect again
PugRug - bad you pretty much advertised my host
BabyAces - CAT-GANG puggo should be banned.
bad - @BabyAces wats ur current dc acc?
CoolBoi91191991912928382881 - Blue_ 'atleast i don’t pull ips from my database ((i don’t have one btw)' meaning i don’t have a database. they said 'my database' so they followed it up saying they don’t have a database.
