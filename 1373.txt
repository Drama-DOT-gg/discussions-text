SirCatAlt - So we have seen plexed's filth and all he has done with all of his customer data he has lost over the months, he has lost over thousands of customer data adn went to abuse big corporations, now im not saying im bad, but im my opinion i dont think i went as far as him, i was very new to hosting when i was abusing, and i of course had no source of income, but this thread isnt about me it is about the scum Plexed/Badsk himself. (Side Note: Ik this thread is a bit useless but this i just a discussion after all.)
Shershah - Plexed can. He have alot of money and also now his father also supporting him. I already said plexed didnt abusing and have 100% abuse free halex but someone made joke on me and now it is prooved that plexed is not abusing. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-01-09/1641704230-405982-img-20220109-102520.jpg
Aaron_ - He might be able to. But to me your and Plexed's new hosts will never be an option.
GreenArrow99 - tried to set bait and uhh looks like mans changed or was smart - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-01-09/1641714536-207695-image.png
GreenArrow99 - But eh I think halex nodes isn't abusing anything as its been there for a while.
SirCat-Qlox - idk in my opinion he will never be able to repay for the damages he has caused and all of the data his customers lost cuz of him
babyharpseal - he may be able to pay the dedis, but I'm sure he won't be able to pay the user's data that was lost.
Shershah - Aaron_ your

why my lol?
TheAlex - Shershah 
You are missing the way he got his money.
Jen - TheAlex His mom?
TheAlex - Shershah He may have changed but his host and your host will be out of my interest and further collaboration tbh

He because he is a shitty ass scammer
You because you support him
TheAlex - Jen 
Obvi scamming lmao
Shershah - One question how we are scamming now? You out of mind? we provided proofs of invoices.
Jen - Shershah badsk has always had proof of invoices on his failed hosts and his new ones
u act as if its some revolutionary technology
Shershah - Jen paypal one?
Jen - Shershah yup
he's done it all
Shershah - Jen But now he is paying.
Jen - Shershah Oh so nowwww its different
Just because he's finally paying after what like 4 hosts or more fail
Jen - i'm sure that him finally paying
makes up for all the laws he has broken
Shershah - Jen Can we not just forget past? If someone is trying to improve himself from his mistakes then why you are demotivating that guy? If you can't motivate then you are no one to demotivate.  If he is abusing then his host should closed till now but halex is up and running fine.
Jen - Shershah Sorry
Let's just demonstrate that a company acts like badsk
They would be sued and everyone would get their actual compensation
Shershah - Jen But badsk didn't scam peoples money.
Jen - Shershah are u??
uh
on drugs
Shershah - Jen Can you give me one proof when he scammed people's money?
Jen - Shershah lmfao i'm dead
Shershah - Jen ig this is not proof. He only abuse broken companies.
Jen - Shershah u do realize
that
abusing people's stuff
is scamming people of their money right?
He's taken the company's money &amp; the time
Shershah - He is smart that he got these expoilt where 20 to 30 or more teams are working.
Shershah - Jen is scamming people of their money right?

Yes. But company should fix that expoilt. Instead they ignored abuse reports.
Jen - Shershah Okay
I don't understand what this has to do with the company
Your completely ignoring the point that badsk has stolen money of rental property
Shershah - Jen *He didnt stolen. He found expoilt.  And tell me one person who don't like free things?
GreenArrow99 - so if you were to get access to a random 128GB ram dedis by mistake you'd accept it even if you're liable for a lawsuit?
Jen - Shershah You just sound stupid, Exploiting is literally illegal especially when it uses rental services and exploits it to be free. So technically if he was caught he would have been sued
Deleted User - shershah why the hell are you supporting plexed
SnailDOS - Lmao this kid
Ichigo - Shershah lemme go murder your mom and tell say lets just forget the past
Shershah - Ichigo and same i did with all you family members and will say this Okay?
Shershah - Zachery plexed is not abusing now. He is legit paying.
Ichigo - Shershah im disagreeing with the statement you said forget the past of him doing illegal things
you want us to forget his past so if i kill your mom will you forget my past?
FlyingMane - Shersah are you ok?? 
Badsk is THE scammer, just because now he is paying for his servers doesn't mean
He will ever fix his mistakes
He doesn't over allocate his desks (which i am 100% sure he does

Also, you can't just say "yeah let's forget the past, whatever". You just can't. The money he is using to pay for his nodes isn't even his money, it's the money he got from scamming people.

Also every dataloss, every customer info sold is scamming. He took the trust of his customers and shat on it
Kowone - FlyingMane He doesn't over allocate his desks (which i am 100% sure he does

have never heard of free hosts not overallocating their nodes
GreenArrow99 - Kowone Plexed is already overallocating, most of his nodes are on 99% cpu and the singapore node literally died
Aaron_ - Shershah I meant Qlox's and Plexed's
FlyingMane - Kowone 
Wait he is running a free host?
Aaron_ - GreenArrow99 GG
FlyingMane - GreenArrow99 
Exactly what I mean. He won't really, look at him just make enough money to run the nodes and claim they were suspended just like dubs did in mcworld
GreenArrow99 - FlyingMane Plexed would never open a paid host as customers wouldn't even purchase servers from him and if they did they will be able to sue Plexed for dataloss
Kowone - GreenArrow99 i didn't say that, you poor motherless dumbass. i've only said "have never heard of free hosts not overallocating their nodes"
GreenArrow99 - Kowone you didn't have to, I'm sharing my view of point.
FlyingMane - Kowone 
Still? I understand over allocation like @Oliver1234dotdot Does it. Not too hard on the machine, just perfect. What the fuck is plexed doing tho?
Kowone - GreenArrow99 why the fuck you replied to my message earlier then
GreenArrow99 - btw where is he getting the money to pay for the nodes?
GreenArrow99 - Kowone Cuz I was sharing my opinion with you...
Kowone - GreenArrow99 there's no need for your opinion, i (or probably almost everyone in drama.gg) have seen lots of free hosts overallocating their nodes
GreenArrow99 - Kowone Fine, My bad. I just thought to type about halexnode's current overallocation
Milan - Shershah forget the past? stfu.
Milan - Shershah doesnt matter if u found an exploit to get it for free
Milan - Aaron_ my rlly isnt now, im short on cash, i lost a way to get profit so i opened a second bussiness to earn profit back and hopefully be able to pay for my nodes
Milan - and if plexed is paying for his fucking nodes, where is he getting the money from, hes gotten servers from server auction that costs over 30 eur and shit, he even got singapore, which is usually a bit more expensive than other servers like in germany us
Milan - and why tf are ppl starting to even forgive plexed now, after all he has done, just cuz his paying doesnt mean the past is gone, it will always stay and will most likely stay on drama.gg forever, just cuz badsk is paying for his nodes doesnt mean he can fix the issues he has caused, and all of the data he has lost over the months, his a fucking scammer, and i wont be suprised if he starts abusing again.
Milan - and before u say anything, no i dont want forgiveness, cuz i did abuse and ik ppl of drama.gg hate ppl that does abuse, and ive stopped abusing but ik my actions can never be forgotten or forgiven.
Xmomoo - Milan Are u really firing things up?
Ples - Xmomoo maybe i am and maybe not, i just dont want ppl to respond to me saying that u also abused and that shit so i just cleared it up, btw ik this is confusing as hell cuz im on 2 accs now i have so many accsi ts hard to find the right one
Aaron_ - Milan and why tf are ppl starting to even forgive plexed now

This applies to you as much as it does to Badsk.
Ples - Aaron_ ik it does, i rlly dont want or care about forgiveness, and i do not understand why some ppl are forgetting me now too
Deleted User - Milan mate dont you got gcp servers lmfao
Jen - Ples Badsk Provide Compensation &gt; Badsk gives lip service apology and really doesn't mean it
Deleted User - Jen i even bothered to give plexed a second change guess what he did just 2 days later, he went on to get google servers and when i asked him why hes using gcp free trial he said "well, im gonna continue paying after the trial because its currently free money"
Ples - Zachery ... what the fuck do u mean no i havent used gcp in a long while i got hetzner, and im actually paying for it.
HaiNot_ - Christmas money came in clutch , ay?
Shershah - HaiNot_ arent you a skid who have dndw role in drama.gg?
Shershah - HaiNot_ also you told sumukh that every host abuse and you also abuse.
HaiNot_ - Shershah I never told him that ðŸ¤£ he told me that austesic when it used to be lush used to use abused nodes
HaiNot_ - Shershah skid?? shershah ig u need to clear ur mind
SirCat - dont u just love it when some of the old customers keep using plexeds hosts, after he has fucked them over caused datalosses and shit, and some ppl dont understand he is using the money HE SCAMMED from his customers, from their data, and im gonna stay to believe that until he provides proof where he gets all of his fucking money from, ik he used to use adsense cuz mike tried to get an adsense for him but it got suspended.
TheAlex - SirCat b-b-b-but, IT is different now! 
he is paying for them 
right?
right?
SirCat - TheAlex he is paying, but he still got a fucking  dataloss and blamed it on his internet ðŸ¤£
TheAlex - SirCat wait he got a dataloss while having premium servers?
SirCat - TheAlex yes, he fucked hte panel up somehow and now noone can backup and he says his internet is so trash so he just said FUCK THAT DATA BOYS!
TheAlex - SirCat

SirCat -  - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-01-11/1641891692-398737-image.png
SirCat - holy shit ok but fr, plexeds hosts will just be for his enjoyment he only makes it cuz his bored of course, he doesnt care aobut his ppl/customers at all he says fuck them causes a nice dataloss blames it on his internet, how do ppl still mark him AS FUCKING TRUSTWORTHY HE SOHULD BE THE MOST UNTRUSTWORTHY FUCKING HUMAN BEING ALIVE!
Deleted User - Ples well you still did
Jen - Ples wow Ur "actually" paying for it? As if this is supposed to make up for all the other hosts u "scammed" with
Loser - lol
Ples - Jen what ive only had one host and that is qloxhost which i rebranded to kittennodes
