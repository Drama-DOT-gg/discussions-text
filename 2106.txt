Arkhan_Old_Acc_Deleted - In Germany (also other Countries like partially Netherlands) it is required to have an Imprint/Impressum or also called "Contact us with Business Information". If the Founder, the Website or a Employee is German, the Website requires an Impressum. This also is required if a Website has German Language involved or German Translation features (in-built Google Translator also counts). If this does not apply the Operator of the Company or Website can pay a tasty fine of up to 50.000 Euros.

I apologize if any Information provided above is wrong. Incase it is correct me and I will edit the Message.
