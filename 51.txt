STMR - At least I'm honest like I said WHMCS and cPanel make 1000's so me making the odd $100-$1000 would not hurt them at all lol
Iceey - STMR That's one of if not the worst arguments I've ever seen.
mxnugget - STMR Doesn't matter.

IMagine if all people would you like you. Crack software. Would companies do any profit?
No. They won't.

That's why I hate crackers. I imagine being in the place of companies that pay thousands in employees and investments and later find out that some dudes are cracking their work. Not fun.
STMR - fix the method of cracking and there would not be any cracks there more then able to fix it
mxnugget - STMR Lmao, that doesn't mean you can crack software.
Also the worst argument I have ever seen.
STMR - So does advertising by your name should be banned for that
mxnugget - STMR I see that you're now changing the topic.
Also, there's no TOS on this forum.
