darkuser2006 - itzmayankind is scamming others / abusing free startup credits of OVH, here is a screenshot of our chats


I ask him if its a VPS or a Bare metal server and he keeps changing it from vps to bare metal to dedicated, and i have no idea which he might have told others too..








he accepted to using ovh credits and reselling them, even if someone bought i doubt how long it would have run with that many credits. 

Then he proceeds to add me to a group where he was sending screenshots of his and "Russhvith" chats, he proceeded to show all old images where he was purchasing from him and when i told him to go down, the reality was exposed he was ghosting him because he did not pay the bill and his account was suspended.





And i recorded the whole video which i have with me (Will send in another message below this)

Overall he tried to use the name of FloraMC.host as he tells he is a Sr. Admin there, which is false (Told by the actual owners)



And blocked me and removed me from group

ast3risk - -- the above post is from a newly registered user --
ast3risk - @darkuser2006 you recently registered on drama.gg and your client is suspicious, having nothing but floraMC and 2 chats.
RusshvithSJ - ast3risk But yes, i vouch for what has happened and he is indeed a scammer. He has purchased servers from us and when requested to pay told tomorrow, in a loop and i told its last day and i will delete if you dont pay he just ignored from there, and when i dm'ed him about why did he try using our name for his scam he said this 



Someone scammed him so he scams others - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-08-23/1692803489-400500-image.png

RusshvithSJ - ast3risk That dosent mean he cant expose, am i correct?
ast3risk - @RusshvithSJ Thank you.
ast3risk - RusshvithSJ He can, I just prefer to take claims from accounts like that with a grain of salt. and a discord like that can be a big red flag
RusshvithSJ - ast3risk Okay, i can understand it is suspicious and i'm a member on drama.gg from 2020 all the way back and yes he is a scammer and even i tell to not purchase anything from him
ast3risk - RusshvithSJ I know, I checked your profile.
RusshvithSJ - Also his "hosting" is selling this 

10€ for 32 GB Ram @ france - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-08-23/1692803705-871205-image.png
ast3risk - RusshvithSJ I can't comment as I have my own hypervisor server.
RusshvithSJ - And epic announcement channel - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-08-23/1692803776-541184-image.png
RusshvithSJ - ast3risk Its directly from another reseller who either abuses or they do by creating new new accounts mostly from AWS, Linode etc where you can get credits for just signing up
ast3risk - I don't know what prices are "acceptable" as I haven't bought anything in the hosting space.
ast3risk - RusshvithSJ 💀 I mean, you can tell they're professionals
ast3risk - God if I started a hosting company, infra and the site, panel and whatnot come first not the fucking discord
RusshvithSJ - ast3risk Absolutely correct, and if see their TOS and privacy policy you will understand - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-08-23/1692803961-431393-image.png
RusshvithSJ - ast3risk Absolutely correct, and if see their TOS and privacy policy you will understand - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-08-23/1692803967-872538-image.png
RusshvithSJ -  - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-08-23/1692803989-298806-image.png
ast3risk - RusshvithSJ Wow they had sapphire, a great bot with the best embed editor and they fucked it up, also those are supposed to go on the site.
ast3risk - the top ToS seems quite similar to that of a big tech company
RusshvithSJ - ast3risk  Clearly you can see the effort put into this and the mail support@Sparkcloud.host does not even exist 😂, indeed Sparkcloud.host is not even registered https://www.whois.com/whois/sparkcloud.host
ast3risk - The 24h refund policy is a joke, and the ToS was probably stolen.

They also seem to hold the right to change the ToS or suspend your server without notifying you.
RusshvithSJ - ast3risk Yep
ast3risk - RusshvithSJ 💀 use the whois CLI tool sometime - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-08-23/1692804157-413958-image.png
RusshvithSJ - If anyone wants to checkout their discord https://discord.gg/cKPJjjzdFJ
ast3risk - ast3risk running dig against it or just visiting it in your browser also gives the same result.
SoSad - RusshvithSJ The pricing is very cheap so to anyone looking for very cheap providers make sure you do your research before purchasing and before purchasing make sure that you will be able to get your money back incase you do get scammed
ast3risk - SoSad A better idea is to pay more for a better provider.
SoSad - ast3risk That is true but for the people who just cant afford to pay more will try to find the cheapest one they can find
ast3risk - SoSad Well I just use my own infrastructure so I won't have to worry about that.
