DevilOfcurse - Navo hosting a new host that has 0 quality and 0 support staff and 0 for prices 

The owner of Navo Hosting is Ir0niic itâ€™s partnered with bluestar aka node-mc the Owner didnâ€™t even pay 1$ to the servers or billing or nothing someone called saini he was the owner of bluestar aka node-mc he made him the vps and billing SINCE he was using billing that cracked in his server.

the owner of navohosting tryin to scam people by putting prices up and selling domains and its free the owner didnâ€™t even pay 1$ to saini and he is trying to scam people and earning money
DevilOfcurse - Ir0niic betrayed me and started new host and he is supposed to work with me when Iâ€™m mad to him he ruined my host and our panel and servers .
Electraa - DevilOfcurse ok so like you know everything eh. Saini was partner. And the thing you said owner didn't pay. We have proof we pay more in our host and we have transcript of pay. Other then that Saini just helped him to setup the panel and billing. Which we already taked billing down a week ago. The billing of our was online like 2/3 days. And we don't scam like ya. We give domain for free . We just make it 1/2 invites so we setup or we tell them where to go to make. You can't judge as without even seeing as. And also @AYS  you didn't checked our support service. There is no bad service. I just don't know what you meant but I can say our support service is good. You didn't even check. Also like we did a sort of dm advertise we agree with that. But in future we are taking more good steps without dm advertising. Idk what I just said in this paragraph lol.
Electraa - DevilOfcurse why you guys were mad then huh
BringOS - The hosting called navo hosting are fraud. Owner is a jerk. They Delete all the low rating reviews they get. In their paid services billing site they don't even have https:// they have http:// which cannot be trusted with billing purposes ðŸ˜‚.
The server is laggy af. No proper support.

KejiDiscord - Good job Navo Hosting  CEO. Trying to cheat huh? Are u trying to make the new hosting company iplay hosting look bad?

If u guys dont know. Iplay hosting is a new paid hosting company that was released a month ago. It actually uses an app (available on google play. Idk for ios) 

A few minutes ago i was a video about the video made by a youtuber (IM Sonya)   


But then i saw this comment 

And it was form navo hosting. They are trying to stop veiwers to use iplay hosting and use navo hosting instead. What a shame.

I went to the review of the app directly. This is what i saw
 https://youtu.be/SrtLd-TY22g

Navo hosting CEO. Its not fair to do that. Better apologize to Iplay Hosting CEO. Or u are in a big troblue dude - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-10-02/1601670348-707970-screenshot-20201003-001119-1.jpeg

Jedrik - Keji, you've been making threads about hosts that already have threads, if you have anything more to add please add them to the existing thread.
MCKingSam - NavoHosting is a scummy and low quality service. Please view the evidence provided below.

No SSL on their main site (panel) which is a concern as data is passed through it.

No main website, just using pterodactyl.

Using discord to sell servers on their panel. (

Owner is extremely childish and does not have much knowledge of servers.

No terms of service or privacy policy which is a major concern when customer data is stored on their panel.

Thinks that a recommendation (Hetzner) is DM Advertising.

Not legally registered.

Site:
https://navohosting.net/ - as you can see, HTTPS is not there, invalid certificate.
https://discord.com/invite/TUGNhM6 - discord server
https://twitter.com/Navohost - twitter
HCS - How many hosts are legally registered? Also the owner said ages ago he was "working" on a site 
Thats a hell of a long time - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-10-04/1601807421-157741-image.png

Korudo - Is it forced tho?
yuzu - JAY Ah yes, so your dev is a german that runs a German Hosting Business called X-Core?

Very believable
eraters - yay yuzu's alive
Emericion - yuzu oh yes mate I got a dev and he own a business called GOP (hes a billonare)
Jedrik - Emericion ðŸ¥±
DeadBush - JAY you don't have tos and privacy policy lmaoðŸ˜‚ and you were telling me bruhhh
DeadBush - MCKingSam I know right the owner threaten to jail and stuff a lot of scams he manipulated a guy and then he shut his new Hosting down. lol He once dmed to make fake review about his Hosting in return to promote my discord server ðŸ˜‚
Emericion - brruhhh hes the chairman of grand old party i not joking i have proof
Detective_Alpha - Ok so,I used to be an employee at navohosting, and one day I dmed a costumer asking them if they wanted to buy anything, then he started an argument that his hosting is better and such, 2 days later I get a dm from the other owner saying https://imgur.com/a/9zx00Ss, and after that i checked my SMP as i usually do and it was all gone (My private smp that he had ranks,I paid for everything there]) and it was all gone (https://imgur.com/a/2q5QdB9),after that i checked all websites that I had mod on to take revenge and i did this which can be fixed in minutes if they upload the backup (https://imgur.com/a/cmgcTzA),after that I told them about this and the other owner replied with this (https://imgur.com/a/wZL5k1r), if it wasnt some staff from another hosting and that message I wouldn't even make this post,so yeah thats all,  Demotion message nonblurred https://imgur.com/a/bVhkGSt , also he has some money that he never gave me or could give me because he banned me blocked me and such
Thank you for at least reading this, and they resell from Tilted Hosting ,https://imgur.com/a/PubVGOZ
P.S. This is the first time I came to WinterHoax and  i didnt know how scammy they are
Jedrik - Merging with existing Navo thread
Detective_Alpha - Btw their services are poor and low quality af
Detective_Alpha - ok
TMKC - Detective_Alpha We all know this is alot of bullshit.
You never mention the entire story.

You where going around to other Discord servers causing drama. You represented US while doing so. We told you multiple times that it was not okay to do so.  We gave you alot of chances, but you refused to listen, hense the demotion.
The reason why Jay "ruined" the Discord, was because you used a NavoHosting Discord Template and even used the same name.  So technically, Navo owned that Discord server.

We do not resell ANY services from TiltedHosting. We have our own hardware.

Before trying to ruin someone's reputation, tell the entire story first.  Lies will come up faster than you think.

Also, YOU ruined our clientarea with dirty words, spam creating packages etc which all are logged in our system.
JAY - Detective_Alpha thank you for deleting our products on our site you was demoted for all sorts of reasons regarding causing drama with other hosts and dm advertising on wither hosting 

and we banned you for blackmailing staff and breaking tos wich is bannable

i can show more if needed - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-01-17/1610901863-502875-image.png
Detective_Alpha - Good take on it ngl,but it wasnt your server nor your layout and before i was demoted you had tiltedhosting services so
Detective_Alpha - and the photo from GalaxyBe has nothing to do with navo :3
JAY - Detective_Alpha Good take on it ngl,but it wasnt your server nor your layout and before i was demoted you had tiltedhosting services so

i made a template and you took it from our discord and copied the rules and ext thats on there gl making lied ngl
Detective_Alpha - and i have logged how he destroyed my server 10 hours apart,while TMKC was saying that I took revenge first
Detective_Alpha - no,I can show by dates that it wasnt copied, because of xenon
Koisip - So let me get things straight

Detective_Alpha basically impersonated and made bad reputations despite being told not to and took stuff from Nova Hosting. 
In addition Detective was warned several times yet continued to do so.

Detective_Alpha, your legit stupid. Idk what gave you a justified reason to make drama but it generally looks like you want to boost your own ego.
Detective_Alpha - Koisip No? Plus this isnt Nova hosting if you can read, I didnt take anything from navo hosting, plus if you would have read the whole thing you would have saw why I made this in the first place, and ngl with that grammar you are the stupid one.
Detective_Alpha - BringOS They indeed delete every low rating review they get, servers are laggy af and crash causing error 500 all the time, Pterodactyl panel is not themed at all and support sucks
Detective_Alpha - Also here is a pic of them telling me to advert on alts :3 - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-01-18/1610971590-718618-unknown.png
JAY - Koisip perfect]
Detective_Alpha - JAY Like your DNDW tag :3
Detective_Alpha - JAY His comment is innacurate and fake so :3
Detective_Alpha - I mean ur DNDW tag is accurate and true lmfao.




Bad choice of words sozzzzzz
eraters - Detective_Alpha this can be taken wayyy out of context. he can be telling you not to dm ad after you did it, he could be saying just not to do it, he could be saying to do it but on an alt, we don't have context, so we don't know.
Detective_Alpha - eraters oof
Detective_Alpha - Tilted Yep
Detective_Alpha - I mean we got a lot of proof from what JAY posted
WockySlush - Navo Hosting isn't a very good company, I won't give out my discord (it's not wocky slush..) but it's overall a pretty odd company. I personally think that the owner needs to learn how to run a company better he's really strange and aggressive most of the time. He lies to customers plenty and fails to provide simple information etc. If I tell much more my identity will be revealed but overall I'd just use a different company.. I'll try to provide as much as I can but for now what I can say is limited for privacy reasons.

I do feel that Detective_Alpha should have been given a warning of some sort instead of immediately resorting to demoting him but Alpha has done a lot of bad things such as slandering other companies and stealing assets and arguing with other company owners for no reason.

Jay has also slandered other company names for using equal hardware to them and is an odd person overall.

Tilted Hosting is no better though, they've had a pretty bad background in general. For your safety, please just stay far away from both Navo Hosting and Tilted Hosting.
Da-God - TMKC But you guys don't have owned hardware. You literally told us you guys use ovh. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-01-21/1611193355-404287-ovh.png
WockySlush - Da-God I can't wait until Navo shuts down because they can't afford to pay for that ovh they have like 2 customers and bought that
JAY - WockySlush we have more than 2 customers

we just rebranded and most of are clients are on the clientarea not discord
JAY - hmm

tos:
https://navohosting.net/terms

privacy
https://navohosting.net/policy
Jedrik - eraters Well I'll add some emphasis

"Don't dm advertise on your main ffs"
implying that he knows, possibly tasked Alpha to dm advertise.

"Don't dm advertise on your main ffs"
this part right here implies fully that he should do it on an alt.

"Don't dm advertise on your main ffs"
Pretty self explanatory

"He can be telling you not to dm ad after you did it" / "He could be saying just not to do it" -- If so, why was there a "on your main" part
Jedrik - Merging with existing navo thread
Detective_Alpha - WockySlush I didnt steal assets ,but alr
Detective_Alpha - WockySlush They have a stable salary, and they can afford that unfortunatelly
Detective_Alpha - WockySlush Plus i think i know who you are :3
Detective_Alpha - Jedrik I would have given you more screenshots about the task but I cannot because most of the things were in the staff chat (Jay was always telling us to use that and I now know why )
WockySlush - Detective_Alpha If you know who I am, dm me on discord with a screenshot of this message. :)
Detective_Alpha - WockySlush Dont have u at friends
WockySlush - Detective_Alpha hehe :)
Detective_Alpha - You know what,just wait a little ;3
Tilted - I have him as a friend :))
Detective_Alpha - Tilted we both do :3
JAY - Tilted dont trust alpha he griefed our clientarea and tried to say stuff to boost his ego 

and copied code from our bot when staff and tried to claim it and broke tos
Detective_Alpha - JAY You griefed me first, I didnt steal any code and you broke the TOS
Detective_Alpha - JAY And btw why did you claim to be a registered business while you are not
Detective_Alpha -  - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-01-22/1611309516-624850-image.png
Detective_Alpha - JAY And if you tell a story, tell it from the start to the end :3
Detective_Alpha - JAY And he does not trust me xD , he just looked at the proof and compared :3
JAY - Detective_Alpha 

Imagine making fake reviews and then blackmailing me and then deleting what you said because you know I'm right - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-01-22/1611329713-537762-screenshot-20210122-153238-comdiscord.jpg

Detective_Alpha - JAY The reviews aren't fake, and if we talk about faking you were the one that falsely accused me of stealing your "code" , you are the one that kept saying that there where stuff from your bot in my bot, plus even you said that you will give on whatsapp so thats why I played along :3

WockySlush - JAY (the "founder" of Navo Hosting) has decided to suspend my services from his dogshit of a company for giving Detective Alpha a screenshot of JAY saying that his company isn't registered after he acted like it was so. 

Claim 1: JAY (the "founder" of Navo Hosting) has decided to suspend my services from his dogshit of a company for giving Detective Alpha a screenshot of JAY saying that his company isn't registered after he acted like it was so. 

https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-01-22/1611309516-624850-image.png
the image above was the "leaked" discord dm that caused JAY to suspend my paid service.

 JAY has slandered many companies for using the equalivent hardware to himself, he doesn't know what he's doing or how to run a company. He's a deceiver and nothing more. Yesturday, Jay decided to ask for my companies number knowing that we aren't registered as we began operations about a week prior. I said that we are not yet registered and decided to ask for his company number, at this point Jay decided to appear offline and ignore my question I looked into the Navo Hosting discord and how funny, Jay was in a private office appearing offline what a coincidence as soon as I ask him for his company number he decides to appear offline? I repeatedly asked for the next day or two until he finally admitted that his company wasn't registered. After this, I decided to tell Alpha that Jay was basically lying to people about it, I gave Alpha the screenshot above and he decided to post it on Winterhoax (this thread..) I knew that Jay would be petty about it and do something like this so I asked Alpha to delete it but it's his choice he decided not to though he did atleast blur my name out. Anyway, at this point I have been banned from the Navo Hosting discord and my services have been deleted which I have paid for. Navo is not a registered company yet the owner implies that it is by showing terms of services etc etc. he can be very aggressive and overall unprofessional, for example he told me to calm down after he started being aggressive in a dm lmfaoo. He claims that a dm is completely related to his hosting company etc etc. 

Jay is one of the slower hosting provider owners, he leaked his own address on an image that was poorly covered up with marker on this very thread and he was pretty scared when I recited his address to him. 

Overall, Navo Hosting is a unprofessional, heap of garbage hosting provider. Stay away at all costs. Jay is a liar, deceiver, and he's immature. He fails to provide simple information and even declines free trials to specific people (but not all people) because their "un-necessary"  He's running a fraud company it's almost laughable.

Here's a good bit of my dms with jay you'll have to ignore the timestamps etc. You might find some funky stuff in there. :)

WockySlush - TMKC you shouldn't of left Tilted Hosting you've absolutely screwed yourself over tbh I love how you sent this to tilted yet your now in an actual scam operation



it's crazy how fast people can change. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-01-22/1611338335-219871-image.png
Detective_Alpha - WockySlush Mhm, not only Tilted is cheaper than you atm but even kinda better :3
Tilted - JAY 
That would off been nice but you guys decided to place a dispute on the payment even when we agreed on giving you the WHMCS refund.
And just to be clear you did say that you would happily take the whmcs credit.
Detective_Alpha - Tilted Yeah I was there and I even asked Jay twice if he wants to take WHMCS credit
Tilted - Detective_Alpha are you talking about wokey slush's host or navo-hosting's?
Detective_Alpha - Tilted Navo
WockySlush - Detective_Alpha to be clear your talking to Jay right?
Detective_Alpha - WockySlush wdym
Detective_Alpha - TMKC Navo didnt even own a bit, even Jay said that he put the announcment with navo to i quote "make me happy"
Jedrik - We've made a conclusion -- Kindly dm me via discord if you'd like to continue the discussion with new information about Navo.
Tilted - Navo hosting is a bunch of scammers and are corrupt. TMKC (COO) says he has cancer and ask me for money but look he is spending $150+ on a ryzen 7 node.
what happened to the cancer that TMKC says he has? 
When I figured this out I was honestly sick to my stomach. 
He comes and ask me for money and says he's poor and he needs help paying for his bill well wow I call bull shit because how can he pay for this new ryzen 7 node when he has bills to pay.
Also next time maybe next time stick to your word. 
You say you want to make the refund by whmcs but boom 2 days later we get a dispute put on us.
If we agree on something don't pussy out and put a dispute. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-01-23/1611391755-843458-screen-shot-2021-01-22-at-12532-pm.png

You say you want to make the refund by whmcs but boom 2 days later we get a dispute put on us.
If we agree on something don't pussy out and put a dispute. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-01-23/1611391813-369576-screen-shot-2021-01-22-at-12830-pm.png
Tilted - Navo hosting is a bunch of scammers and are corrupt. TMKC (COO) says he has cancer and ask me for money but look he is spending $150+ on a ryzen 7 node.
what happened to the cancer that TMKC says he has? 
When I figured this out I was honestly sick to my stomach.

JAY - is there any proof of these obligations your enquiring
JAY - Tilted i think you accidentally lost half the story i said no to the dispute because you tried to charge me %25 of the refund i did because you were false advertising products which is scamming and it wasn't stated in terms:

"if you file a dispute because the company is a false advertising products you must pay %25 percent of the refund to them because their paypal is in the negatives"

and J0SH said to pull a dispute because he said otherwise i'm never gonna get the money at the end of the day you don't need to try and boost your ego by thinking your in the right when your not!

TIP: don't try and scam users to pay you money @Tilted :)

dont have a nice day
JAY [ owner of navo ]
WockySlush - JAY again, your brain is the size of a walnut, nice professionalism by the way.

"dont have a nice day"
JAY - https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/799727798255484928/802678194724798484/unknown.png

same with you OwO
@WockySlush
WockySlush - JAY I don't recall trying to be professional in that screenshot you braindead monkey.
TMKC - WockySlush Before talking to others about being unprofesional, maybe stop advertising your own store without SSL, nulled WHMCS and no free plans when you advertise free plans.
WockySlush - TMKC For one, our store does infact have SSL, we do not use nulled WHMCS and we do have free plans. I understand your trying your hardest to protect your organizations reputation, but sadly your just making it worse.

Detective_Alpha - What did i miss :3
Detective_Alpha - JAY You say he bloody lost half of the story, WBU wtf, like almost half of the time you would say only the things that I did to you but not what you did to me ........
JAY - Detective_Alpha ??? jedrick said u didnt include everything lol
Detective_Alpha - JAY I kinda did, but neither did you.
JAY - No matter what no one included everything cuz alot happend and i got bad memory past is past
Detective_Alpha - JAY Dude u literally wiped almost everything that you have done from the story (Or at least TMKC did ..............)
AbisGamer - Hmmm the convo is ending so let's talk about how I bought a domain for 1 year then was never given access to the domain panel thingie, never given transfer key and then later asked "why do you need it" and told they "lost" it.
Detective_Alpha - AbisGamer Fr?
eraters - that'd be a problem on whmcs, wouldn't it?
Detective_Alpha - eraters Their WHMCS is more than fine
eraters - then he shouldn't have "lost" the domain as whmcs was using it's built in module
Detective_Alpha - eraters Just navo being scummy
AbisGamer - eraters idk about that all I know is that they don't frkin refund and just take or "suspend" your things
eraters - he also provided no evidence, whmcs auto handles this, not jay, and also the fact that why would you buy a domain from navo when there are more widely known places that are cheaper
Detective_Alpha - AbisGamer Classic Navo
Detective_Alpha - eraters Nah bro when he bought Jay did the stuff manually
eraters - and show me the evidence of this
Detective_Alpha - eraters He was Jay's friend until Jay became Jay
AbisGamer - eraters he told me not to buy from other places and that he gives it cheaper, I'll have to scroll up a lot but I can get proof if you want. Also I demanded the Panel access and transfer key before they "lost" it
eraters - i want to see the proof of you paying.
AbisGamer - eraters ok
AbisGamer - eraters 

That's the domain payment - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-01-26/1611673910-160112-screenshot-20210126-161113-paypal.jpg
AbisGamer - Detective_Alpha Oh boy oh boy so I was owner in a mc server with saini and it was being ddosed because they are JAY'S enemies and were asking for money and so I told them to leave galaxybe alone and go ddos jay's WEBSITE or other mc servers and then he tells everyone that I told or paid them to ddos his NODES. Now he knows his host has nothing to do with our server so he kept on saying I participated in illegal activity and all other staff believed it and he wanted owner so I gave him owner and left to avoid drama then after sometime I try to go back and then I find out he has banned me which deleted a 3000 words explanation I left in staff announcement and he also deleted his ticket. And now when I am properly talking to him and disproving his lies about me participating in "illegal activities" he literally said "I never, I'm busy with other aruguments brb" and hasn't replied for like 45 minutes now.
AbisGamer - Detective_Alpha the ddoser himself said he didn't ddos jay at all and also stopped ddosing the server. And jay is telling people how I wanted to be the only owner and take over and stuff and look whos banned and whos owner and taking over. The worst part is that the other Owner Saini has no idea about what happened because he hasn't come online for ages. Jay is straight up manipulating the staff and server members and even made a announcement that I was kicked for "Illegal activities and Manipulating and trying to cover it up" and I wasn't kicked I LEFT and couldn't join back because JAY BANNED ME.
Detective_Alpha - AbisGamer I blame Jay ngl
AbisGamer - So he makes a hosting sells people stuff then after a month he sells the discord server and makes a new one with a new name. Like it was Navo Hosting before and now Its Navo Services for something
Detective_Alpha - AbisGamer He did the same thing with another costumer
AbisGamer - Detective_Alpha 
Would you jump off a building just because I told you "Just jump off the building lol". His logic is as trash as his host. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-01-26/1611674916-704528-20210126-162748.jpg
AbisGamer - Its been 1 hour 4 minutes since his "brb".
eraters - is it bad that i would never
AbisGamer - When he comes here he is gonna be like "Don't bring galaxybe (the server) into this it doesn't have anything to do with my host bla bla. If galaxybe has nothing to do with your host then I have nothing to do with me telling your enemies to ddos your site instead of my server. They literally said either ban jay or pay 10$, your enemies aren't GalaxyBE's problems.
onyx - AbisGamer That doesn't tell me shit that could have been literally any other service from Navo
AbisGamer - onyx I literally manually paid to them twice cuz their whmcs "wasn't working" - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-01-26/1611675507-158958-screenshot-20210126-161102-paypal.jpg
AbisGamer - They were NavoNode then sold the discord then became NavoHosting then sold the server snd now Navo Services, isn't selling discord servers against tos
onyx - AbisGamer That still tells me shit, you could have ordered 2 services separately.
onyx - AbisGamer if they sold the company the discord was just included as an asset
AbisGamer - Detective_Alpha Look now that I disproved my participation thing he was talking about, now he's saying "pursuing". The has no other excuse than "illegal activities" - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-01-26/1611675618-62884-20210126-163705.jpg
AbisGamer - onyx IF THERE ARE NO REFUNDS THEN GIVE ME MY STUPID DOMAIN I ORDERED. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-01-26/1611675917-943962-20210126-164405.jpg
AbisGamer - eraters more proof 

He straight up said he won't give me domain access and no refund either. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-01-26/1611676186-807803-20210126-164851.jpg
AbisGamer - Is it just me or do all professional companies do this. He offers unlimited resources for web hosting in dms?? Then later will proberly do what he did with my domain, take it away for no reason and some up with excuses and say "idc" after he loses the argument. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-01-26/1611683604-225080-screenshot-2021-01-26-224708.jpg

JAY - toxic i dont understand you got your plan and i said it will be upgarded for free if needed and you havnt made a ticket as the agreement stated
JAY - toxic you pre-paid the invoice in advance and we gave you your product and the rest of the money via paypal i dont understand
ItzToxicYT - JAY u had a valid reason to do a refund, and u didn't. I told you that when I didn't even touch the cpanel. U have every reason to do a refund. But what can I say, you were a hungry mf.
JAY - ItzToxicYT you paid for the product and you didnt give a valid reason you might wanna read tos
JAY - ItzToxicYT your reason was: Saini offerd somthing else
AbisGamer - JAY How about explain why you didn't do thus back in November instead of saying you won't or that you lost it - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-01-26/1611684911-601144-20210126-191119.jpg
ItzToxicYT - JAY I was never meant to buy your scam host, that payment WASN'T PAID FOR YOUR HOSTING, it was decided later. When u told me you were gonna give Unlimited spaces. But then, u changed the whole subject. The reason wasn't only Saini offered me his help, it was because I cannot trust a man who changes the whole subject to eat a bit more cents.
Detective_Alpha - Scummy as always

Please close this thread because ITS OVER, he told me that he won but I told him and he didnt listen, maybe he won the fight, but he didnt win the war. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-01-26/1611689076-542186-image.png
Vanquish - Jáº¯mes#7392 is jay's new discord account
Detective_Alpha - Vanquish Yeah that foker wont give up
DeadBush - lmao What @AbisGamer  says is all true since jay aka ironiic manipulated abis and scammed his domain.
He even asked me to review his host for a shoutout lol. I got 400+ coins in his hosting and I got no server instead he banned me lmao. if you want all proof https://winterhoax.com/d/81-nexal-hosting/21
cuz im a lazy ass and cant be asked to post again XD
and now jay deleted his discord ig im not sure cuz he nowhere to be seen XD
Detective_Alpha - TMKC Said: Here's the thing.  As we explained in our private messages between you, me, Jay and Sloth, we provided all evidence needed to win the case.

Yes, Jay could have done a better job handling the situation, but it still does not explain the fact that what Alpha did was acceptable to any degree. He wrote a crapton of fake reviews on both TrustPilot and WinterHoax.  We managed to get a ton of them removed of TrustPilot with the help of their staff that agreed that it was fake reviews.

The original "SMP" server Alhpa had was designed using Jay's discord template and it even used our name to some degree, and Jay owned 50% of the entire Discord.  He took back what was his by rights.
He took away his template. He never banned people or kicked, only deleted the channel.  If he really wanted to, he could ban everyone as well.

Alhpa then went to our WHMCS portal and decided to remove and rename all of our packages, which took us a long time to restore.
Alpha was fired from Navo in the beginning for breaking staff rules.  After he was fired, Jay took back what was his.
Alpha is good at manipulating people, that is the reason why people are arguing with him.  I'd say about 85-90% of reviews and comments about Navo are fake. We only have 30 people in our database, and maybe 2 or 3 are from WinterHoax, and none of them have any services on their account. They never even USED the service, so how would they know if it was a scam?

And this is my response:
Firstly NONE of the reviews were fake , I removed all of them by hand not "staff" removing them

Secondly The Smp was designed using my old servers' template, I didnt use the name of Navohosting to any degree, only the Versatile name that wasn't even original so he didn't own it at all lmfao https://versatile.host/ , I didnt take his template, he banned everyone
, deleted everything and yeah. He didnt own more than 10-15 procent of the smp, he only owned the network
(And remember, its still not fixed)
Then 10 HOURS later I went to the portal and added a few blank products, which they fixed in half an hour
I was fired because TMKC came lmao, then brang those "staff rules" , I know that because he could have done it earlier,plus he took the network, which was his but in any single degree the SMP was MINE

I never manipulated or even tried to, you have done all the manipulating since the bloody beggining, and you can look at this whole thread and agree, Most of the reviews from navo are from Non-ex clients, or even current clients. Plus they might have gotten a free bot hosting and saw how much it sucks. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-01-27/1611729939-418440-image.png

TMKC - ItzToxicYT If you want to keep the drama going, get the facts straight.
 
 I escalated the claim to PayPal, NOT Jay. I used the information given to me.  So before posting something like this, make sure you "accuse" the right person.
TMKC - Vanquish And how did he leak that stuff and from what date did you get the files from?
I SERIOUSLY doubt that our data has been leaked, at least after I joined Navo.
Iceey - Vanquish Are you retarded?
Iceey - If the aforesaid is in fact true then you, yourself have leaked Client Information and Pirated Installations. You are just as much of a criminal in that case.
Iceey - I will take your word for it and won't download that folder as it is none of my business.
Vanquish - Iceey As I stated, it was on the Navo Hosting webserver, not my fault.
Vanquish - Iceey I was told by a Moderator that I could post that actually.
Iceey - You are liable for the posts you make here, the mod has no right by any data privacy act to allow anyone even himself to publish the information.
Vanquish - Iceey Okay. ãƒ„
Vanquish - TMKC 

WHMCS Installation
WHMCS License Key
WHMCS Database Login Credentials
Client Data (I suppose)

Jay leaked all of this content over a winter hoax discord voice-chat in a matter of 10 minutes.
The download was originally at https://navohosting.net/backup-29thjan.zip but has now been deleted.
A good amount of people have seen it and have all of the things I listed.
ItzToxicYT - TMKC the person I was talking about is jay...
