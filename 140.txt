Tomas - Basically, this dude joined a coding server and started advertising this site, it's not the same people from the other Gratis, but it looks exactly the same. 

I think it's some sorta arc afk'ing thing so they can generate money.
The VPS generation page asks you to wait in "queue", on reloading the page the number changes from 80-100 (from what i've seen) - it's all randomly generated pretty much, not a real queue.



They also claim to be able to give free vps for lifetime with some decent specs, which is bound to cost a lot of money &amp; a huge loss of profit because arc will not pay that much back.



When I asked to see the instances, I just got blocked.



The "vps-hook-****************.php" page is exactly the same, and it's just made to look real when it's the same thing everyone sees. The numbers do not change when you revisit the site (try going to the site twice, the numbers will match) - if anyone else wants to confirm, I get vps-hook-id-918273091827350981723958293485692365928370912830918320571903857019283-012937509825l79891283798235 each time.

If you are in any servers with this user, I suggest you do something about it- pretty sure they've been dm advertising too. This probably isn't their main account but here's the current information:

Scorpzy - Agreed, seems like https://gratisvps.net is similar, with the EXACT same hook ID
Koisip - Pepega
MicroBot - I know these types of scams they redirect you with js on the web page like in 30 seconds it goes to outosstock.html
onyx - Scorpzy holy shit they still exist? i thought they died. they even got a new website damn
Tomas - Scorpzy Yup, it's some stolen script I believe
Tomas - onyx Seems like they do, it's mental
Tomas - MicroBot Yeah, that's fairly similar except this is an afk site
onyx - Tomas damn
Bxrk - Tomas - "Its not a scam" 

Tomas - - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-02-13/1613251006-411550-image.png
Bxrk - but yes, it looks like a money thing
Vanquish - Bxrk Are you talking to yourself?
Tomas - Vanquish no he was responding to the thread lol
INfoUpgraders - It's hard coded into the website after sitting there for 50 seconds, to redirect you to a "sold" page.

To view this for yourself: 
Visit your hook page, here is mine: https://gratisvps.net/vps-hook-id-918273091827350981723958293485692365928370912830918320571903857019283-012937509825l79891283798235.html
Right click -&gt; 'View page source'
And you can see in the meta tags, &lt;meta http-equiv="refresh" content="50; URL='https://gratisvps.net/sold.html'" /&gt; 
which means this just redirects you after 50 seconds of being on the page. Seems like they make it so you stay on the page long enough so they can make money through Google adsense.
Tomas - INfoUpgraders Yeah, I think it's the same variant with the .host domain.
It's insanely scummy.
INfoUpgraders - Yeah for sure
Sydney - No Arc, but it seems to be something like Google Ads
INfoUpgraders - It's AdSense as I mentioned
Deleted User - Renegade
Deleted User - this is like a month old but who cares

DARKRABBIT - Late to respond to this thread, Although knowing of it for well over a year. I've been conducting an operation into the person behind this. I Have found the person behind it, Due to other legal issues I will not be sharing the information about them. This person still actively scams people &amp; is a former dark web vendor.

We managed to find her BTC wallet from "Dream Market" as well as some other things to tie her to money laundering and other crimes. Although many think this is a male, It's a female. She has a YT Page (Which uses her real name, although she denies it being her real name, both her Facebook pages say otherwise).

The user uses a variety of usernames but the same shitty god damn advertisement for exit scamming unsuspecting skids trying to buy "Loaded cash apps" &amp; "Debit cards with low balances that require no socks5 proxies to cash out" the most obvious scams if you were a criminal. Coming from a blackhat lifestyle &amp; Moving into A white/grey hat lifestyle this idiot underestimated my abilities. With the help of 13 others (and one website administrator) we managed to find who she really is. 

This user still runs under the same username with a few others as stated, Direct Deposit, Login (My username but written in greek letters with a different PFP), and my personal favorite: Her own face (see telegram for that one). Before someone asks about it being her on telegram or YT, She admits to this in Doxbin's Telegram. Claiming "Oh that's when I was fat" - In response to the YT Videos she posted (Under her real name).


The total amount of charges she has going is around 40+ Mostly fraud, Drug-related and well, Get this: Child S******** Abuse. Not going to get into that one that occurred on discord back in march of 2021. Either way, Figured I'd update everyone on this. We post her info elsewhere. Enjoy the arrest &amp; Trial coming soon. It's been a long 18 months.
TheYeetster - Holy shit
comfyy - https://uploadi.ng/5TlZ65FR very happy clients 😂
NutellaOsama - Apparently, both LulzandFeelz and D4RKR4BB1T are scammers operating with each other in the Discord and Telegram Scams. You can check this thread made on Breached Forums by qwerty537 in reference to all this: https://breached.to/Thread-Douche-bags-doxxes
NutellaOsama - DARKRABBIT Hahaha! https://breached.to/Thread-Douche-bags-doxxes
Both you and LulzandFeelz going down for your known scams. You scammed qwerty537 $1,000, so dont forget that.
NutellaOsama - @qwerty537 is here too but he has an issue with verifying his profile at the moment, so he cant comment back.
DARKRABBIT - NutellaOsama 


Alameen Karim Merali Nice to see you seeking attention throwing around 3 doxes you didn't produce. 1st of all... You've been banned twice from Doxbin's GC, Pretty sure KT banned you from Doxbin hence why you anonymously post to the comment section of a terrible unproven dox produced by a meth smoking pedophile added to the HoA by a moron than larp under a known Alias.

"You scammed qwerty537" should be "You didn't scam me &amp; You owe me nothing because I spammed your DMs with CP rabbit" 

For those unaware of Mr. Alameen Karim Merali over here larping, He's been banned from Doxbin, Telegram Messenger, Fired from work., Banned from Scammer.info and Has attempted numerous crypto scams including Ransomware, Cloud Mining and a New NFT (Getting banned from OpenSea soon). In Addition to this within the past 2hrs Alameen Karim Merali was also banned from Doxbin the 2nd time for DMing someone CP. He Lives in Tanzania (Make any primate jokes you wanna because Honestly this dude will claim "We're 98% Monkeys" as if that's the intended meaning of the Racist Remark but tbh it's not racist he lacks the amount of intelect to be anything more than a primate and living in East Africa? It only makes it more funny).


What Qwerty has failed to Mention is he used to Simp &amp; Humps Lulz's leg like a little doggy. Qwerty was doxed by Cybr but Doctor &amp; Lulz are my own Lulz dating back to January of 2021 &amp; Doctor dating back to March-May of 2021. I However wasn't doxed by Doctor, the dox he produced was simply found as a result of him getting a screenshot of amazon.com account screenshot of a cheerleading outfit used to Mock Lulz as I said "I'd cheer her on" as she fails to dox me. My name is public... Not sure how it's that hard to do? Doxbin claims "We don't care enough about you" - Yet wastes $2,500 adding an Entry to the HoA.

Lulz self admits to her name being Chawin BTW: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irjGlYQ7nyM Here's her face, she self-admits to this in Numerous chats.

Figured I'd clear my name from a larping pedophile/scammers lies.
DARKRABBIT - However to bring this thread to a closure... Lulzandfeelz ran away after she went legit and feared Qwerty and me retaliating for the swatting she did to my friend (The doxed person mentioned above). However this isn't the end of the saga... This is just the end to a 23 Month investigation now we begin our legal processes 


Hope everyone enjoys their day. I Am DARK RABBIT AKA PAVEL KRAVKENKO Please feel free to reach me on Twitter @D4RKR4BB1T47 if you want to discuss this topic further as I have additional evidence to 4+ scammers/pedophiles whom have associated themselves around Lulzandfeelz or her close associates. 


As for this drama, Please ignore the larping idiot and look forward to some arrests made. I will not link the dox to anyone other than what is publicly accessible.
DARKRABBIT - TheYeetster It gets worse when you've seen the 23m of the investigation
NutellaOsama - DARKRABBIT You’re really dumb bruv, matter of fact, since you’re referencing Africans to be specific on your post, it clearly shows how racist you are. Remember the 13th Amendment of the United States states clearly how to take away the freedom of the blacks, by making them do crime, I guess this is clearly what I’m seeing you doing, luring Africans to be criminals, eh!
NutellaOsama - DARKRABBIT 

This is qwerty537 speaking through NutellaOsamas Account.

Firstly, I'm not banned from Doxbin, I just decided to leave it and start a new life.

Secondly, I have never done a NFT Scam and I never will, the NFT you see on my OpenSea is originally my NFT made by me. In addition to that, you have no proof of your statement. The Q537WDA is clearly a mark quoting "Qwerty537 Warlocks Dark Army" which clearly shows proof that it’s my NFT, so are the word NFTs too which I generated using Artificial Intelligence and the others is of my friend whose an Artist and he works for Law Enforcement too which I’m helping him sell as a contractor (We have a legal business contract to do this).

Thirdly, You're right about me being behind a ransomware program that currently doesn’t exist anymore because I left the fraud business and I’m no longer a fraudster. Matter of fact, I never was, the ransomware wouldn’t even succeed anyway.

Forthly, being 99% monkey isn’t racist, it’s a scientific fact that the DNA is indeed 99% of an ape and 1% of a human and that’s why we have people like you who act like a monkey because your monkey DNA has dominated your human DNA. Same goes for naughty kids who play around like hooligans in schools or people who act like hooligans; I’m a hooligan too and so are my friends from back to my high school (we even have a Hooligan WhatsApp Group), so I can accept that I’m a monkey too. Everyone is a monkey and there’s no denying this because it’s not racist, it’s science. Schools teach the same thing as I learnt this from High School when our headmaster came to us teaching us about human behavior and how it works. If you think your DNA isn’t monkey then question your behavior rather, Mr. Egert, maybe that will make you understand why you act weird or why teens bang tables when they’re bored in class or similar. Think about it.

Fifthly, Just because you think Africans are dumb and poor doesn’t mean they are dumb and poor, if you’ve never been in Africa yourself, you can’t know this. Matter of fact, almost everyone I hang around with are rich with millions of dollars and they’re not dumb, these guys are business men and Mafia, some of them even run the Government or are in the Government. Matter of fact, I live right next to Don Kassims Residence. Don is simply a Mafia Gangster, if you Google the term and interpret it in Italian, not English. This dudes rich too and his family whose a close family friend of mine works in Politics too (he’s the dude who normally finds ways to get us out of trouble too or sometimes even puts us in trouble if he wants depending on what his heart desires) but he’s a good friend of ours and I don’t think he’ll ever put us in trouble with cops again. The dude knows Politics quite well that he even told us the Political Party is always higher than the President in any country, which explains how powerful he is. Remember back in the days when you guys said you’re gonna try get the feds to me and I said I have connections to people that are in high power in Government, this is just an example of one person whom I know. Also, since he has access to everything we can’t hide from him, there’s nothing anyone could do if a person like him catches anyone, I mean seriously, this dude has the technology to even decipher end to end encryption. Last time my brothers friend was wanted (Well, he wanted to take some girl as his girlfriend and that girl was a daughter of someone with high power in Government, so he hid her in a hotel because she was marked missing after not coming back home a few days and it turned into a kidnapping case, even though it wasn’t), he was the one with access to all the information hidden which my brothers friend was hiding from him after he got caught and showed everything to him (WhatsApp Messages, Telegram Chats, Location History and Everything), that way he knew there’s nothing to hide and he had to tell the truth. Eventually, he did and the case was solved after the girl was found in a hotel then he helped release him. This just shows you can’t hide anything from the Government bro and if the Government really wanted you or me to get arrested, they would have done it earlier. Well, I’m not a criminal anymore, I’ve changed, in this case, Government can just disregard any past evidence and they’ll never come after you again, if they keep monitoring you and see you’ve really changed and stopped crimes. If you’re still committing crimes then it could be that they’re just watching you and they’re just giving you time to change and if they see no change in sometime, they’ll come after you, just like they did with the fraudster friend of mine in Nigeria who got arrested by the FBI.


Sixthly, You seem to be larping hard. Like clearly, why do I need to explain that I used to be with LulzandFeelz when it’s clearly in the dox and fully explained either way. All I had to do is post the dox here and leave it for people to check it out and they will then they will automatically know that I used to cooperate with Lulz just so that I could expose her till she ran away lol.


Seventhly, that dox on Officer Travis Scott Patterson wouldn’t have been produced without me helping you since I’ve done most of the work and you’re clearly lying about everything concerning the dox. Me and You did it together and you promised a pay to me which you scammed and never sent me. Inclusive to this, I did most of the OSINT and the remaining information was given by Ahmad, which is why I gave him credit since he contributed to the information from Background Checks. The OSINT on his emails and all, I did and you did the recording from my account since you had full time access which I had granted you with exported chats as well.

Eightly, Doxbin is afraid of me because of the advantage I took over Doxbin Admin Brenton that made him angry (It wasn’t CP, but a good technique I used to take advantage of him using his relationship with a 16 Year Old girl whom he was hitting up on that I caught red handed of him asking about her boobs, him asking her for e-girl attention and such, not to forget that he even had some coke and cheated with 4 girls on his real gf too) which literally led him to even block me, get info on me from Intelx and the next day made a new dox on me, but Idc about the motherfucker either way and neither do I care about the dox. Also, I don’t care about Lulz Dox that I did, Drs dox or anything, Doxbin is totally useless.

Ninthly, You got me into big trouble yesterday for taking down my workplace website (Hypehost.io) which was a business we just started and caused plenty of our money we invested into the project to go down the drain, but I really don’t care about that anymore (The friend who helped start the business forgave me and said we'll invest in a different project), but I just have to let you know that what you did was fucked up bro. He used his own real card, and his own money that he worked for to start the site up and used a theme from Wordpress Theme Store which we were gonna make better and fix before actually advertising it and making money through the hosting but you fucked everything up and he was even pissed off at me because I emailed you from work mail, but he forgave me the next day, but we’re lucky you didn’t take down the other dudes website because that would risk both me and my friends life because the other site belongs to someone big with a Million Dollar Business, G. Anyway, my friends donating more money into starting another business, but this time I told him to make a Business Plan and get documents for the business so we don’t have any fuckups, so even if you report the other business that we start, we’ll have legal documents and a Business Plan to provide to prove we aren’t fraudulent.

 
Finally, You couldn’t re-provide me with information I needed so there’s no credit for you in Lulz dox either since the information was provided by PedoHunters (John Smith) because I clearly asked you for the BeenVerified Report which you never sent back because I had lost it, so I just went ahead and found the information myself without you, which I did through PedoHunters help which he provided and the OSINT and other stuff was all done by me too and not to forget that she ran away because of the dox.

I only co-operate with peeps like you so I could get evidence to turn you in, guess what? That’s why Lulz even ran away. Haha! It’s undercover. Even the CP you saying I spammed, it was a FBI Technique I was using, but it clearly doesn’t mean I’m a pedo, I’m just doing what the feds did back when they hosted a CP site in the Clearweb, but in a different way, for the same purpose. Keep in mind that I’m a Certified Computer Forensic Investigator, Child Pornography is just one of the things I can investigate and have filed as evidence to be taken to the Court of Law using Forensic Tools as a First Responder to any Criminal Incident. I’ve reported over 5-6 Pedos so far to the Center for Missing and Exploited Children who I lured through that technique and never sold any content; I rest my case here, close this thread as I don’t wanna talk about this anymore. I'm done explaining everything. Ohhh! By the way, Mr. Egert, if you’ve got a problem, come to me via email. If only Brenton would have asked one of his Doxbin friends (Vape or Hyperlol )to show you the badge and the secret document cover I showed them, I think I sent it to him too (I didn’t send the whole doc, just the cover to prove he doesn’t know who he’s messing with, as sending the whole document would risk National Security since it’s secret), you could’ve known who exactly you’re messing with, you know. Anyway, like I said, end the debate now and if you have a problem then approach my email. I'm not gonna be on here anymore.

Also, any evidence you try present here will be disregarded even by Law because of the following reasons, this is according to what I learnt from CompTIA on a lesson that concerned Incident Response and handling criminal evidence:

Your evidence can be audited by anyone on here or you could’ve possibly audited it before even presenting it here.
No Chain of Custody is signed by people who are allowed to see, present or preserve the evidence and when it’s exposed to the public, it isn’t secured if it’s exposed and brought out to the Public like how you’re doing (Evidence of any crime is meant to be kept confidential and handled by a First Responder in an encrypted file system and hashed as well).
Evidence that doesn’t follow the correct order of collecting evidence in accordance to the NIST Incident Response Guide by a First Responder (Which is a guide made directly by the US Department of Commerce) cannot be considered as Evidence.
Hashed doesn’t mean you can still bring it out to the public either when it’s meant to be kept confidential and only be seen by few people who signed a Chain of Custody (Even though the hashing is meant to protect the evidence from being tampered with)

So, if you ever claim to have evidence on anyone, never make such things public because you leave a large scope of that evidence never being accepted by the court of Law because of several reasons. If you think about it, even when a big company gets evidence of someone committing crimes, they’ll never make such a thing public, their first responder takes care of everything and once the arrest is carried out then they make it public and such investigations even take years, like it did with me and you on Dr. Deplorable, but that evidence is futile now since it’s public and I even doubt Dr is in prison because we made the evidence public on Doxbin. If we could’ve turned him in before putting the evidence out, he could’ve been gone, same goes for Lulz though she only ran away because that dox has power over her, not because the evidence is good to be presented to Court. Think about it. Here’s my last words before I call this debate off, it’s too late for you to do anything man. Just give up and start a new life, I have and I don’t need Doxbin or any of these other crap in my life either, I’ve become famous on Social Media too and I’m loving it. Think about it, if you start a new life, you won’t have to worry about all that stuff anymore and if you really wanna pursue life as an Investigator, you should just do things undercover and secretly, not bringing evidence out to the Public (This is how we know you don’t work for the Government like you claim), remember when I said I caught 5-6 pedos and sent a report to Center for Missing and Exploited Children recently, I never mentioned the names or other info because I know that’s meant to be secret for now. It was easy catching some of them too as CashApp showed their name too and they were even KKK when I further managed to get more evidence on them. It’s not hard, G; I only did Doxbin for a while to show you that it isn’t worth it, my plan wasn’t to be on Doxbin all my life, but to set an example that nothing good comes out of it, so yeah, 2022 was the year I decided to leave it because it’s not worth being a doxbiner for a person like me who can do better without Doxbin.
