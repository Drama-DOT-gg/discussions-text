IoNetty - Jamie_ Samouel has bad experience in flash, I recognize that pfp. @HarryW
awsamboi - The uptime on the website is false, our nodes are running and works fine: 

Node-1: 

Node-2: 

Node-3: 

Node-4: 

We told you few times that they ARE NOT FINISHED YET.

You got banned because you were so annoying. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-09-01/1630455919-373228-image.png

IoNetty - awsamboi Try using instatus, tons of status pages have random issues.  I'm not defending anyone at the moment.
awsamboi - IoNetty Yeah, Hetrix does false times too, I didn't even notice that the uptime page is broken.
IoNetty - awsamboi But still, you should have a tos to operate.
awsamboi - IoNetty I told him few times that they are not linked and not finished yet. We had one but I removed them because I wanted to update them. But he were so annoying, thats why we banned him.
IoNetty - awsamboi Ah alright.
Jamie_ - awsamboi I was annoying for asking for legal info. You don't have a TOS that is linked publically and refused to give me your not done one when asked.
awsamboi - Jamie_ We told you few times that they are not finished yet...
Jamie_ - awsamboi But you don't understand, you are still operating without one. That is illegal.
Mafia - Correct uptime: https://status.somehost.xyz/
TOS: https://somehost.xyz/tos
AstralVoid - So we ended up on drama.gg beacuse of someone just bugging us about the TOS they told you it will be finished soon and it was
Chirag - Jamie_ found a free host without a tos? go disk fill them or mine on them. don't mine on em, it's useless
awsamboi - Chirag and I'll find in minutes if our disks are full :p
Chirag - awsamboi not when the panel's down
awsamboi - Chirag Bro, there is no fxcking way to do it, our panel is on a different VPS located in Sofia, Bulgaria with the DDoS Protection of "Voxillity" and "Neterra FW", there is no way to down it.
Kowone - awsamboi damn, colocation with voxility?
awsamboi - Kowone Yes, in Neterra.net
AstralVoid - Bro also I think your brain broke it was supposed to be 'almost perfect uptime' - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-09-01/1630511930-27550-image.png
HarryW - IoNetty I'm confused
Sham - AstralVoid yep what a wow üòí
Sham - Jamie_ thing is if they did say that they are still setting this stuff up I just wanna know why you couldn't just take that and say OK or something
awsamboi - So is this ended now?
SlayorPlayz - Oh no the FBI is gonna go after me for giving away free servers with no legal info I am so scared
Tomas - SlayorPlayz haha
comfyy - very original! - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-09-04/1630728862-399258-image.png
awsamboi - comfyy thank you, we tried so hard for this man.
Jamie_ - AstralVoid Wasn't linked on the website ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Jamie_ - Sham Because they are a company operating without a TOS lmao
Jamie_ - SlayorPlayz What ever will you do.
Jamie_ - It amazes me these days that 10 year olds can make hosts, have no clue how and still think everything their doing that is wrong is ok.
awsamboi - Jamie_ So now we are 10 years old? @Mafia
AstralVoid - Jamie_ It amazes me how dumb people can be those days
Sham - SlayorPlayz lmao
Sham - Jamie_ they did say they still making it so u couldn't wait?
SteveCos - Jamie_ Yet its still better than colournodes.com
Time to feel ashamed about yourself lol
Sham - SteveCos ü§£
Jamie_ - SteveCos Yet its still better than colournodes.com

Operates with a TOS, doesn't ban people for asking about legal documents and isn't immature?? Yeh my bad, your company is 10x better.
Jamie_ - awsamboi Well maybe next time link the correct uptime page as that is what your users rely on to see if they can trust your company. The one I was confronted with made me think you turned off your VPSs for fun.
Jamie_ - Sham they did say they still making it so u couldn't wait?

I mean, operating without a valid TOS. I don't think anyone can risk that.
Jamie_ - Put it this way, without a TOS, your customers have no boundaries and neither do you. They could crypto mine on your servers as there is no TOS telling them not to. Then you get in a shit ton of trouble with your VPS company because you have been using it to crypto mine. You could also just delete a users server for "the fun of it" and they couldn't do anything about it because there was no TOS saying you couldn't do that.
Two - awsamboi I'm about to beat your ass.

You need a valid existing privacy policy when you operate.

If you start operating without a privacy policy, or remove it, what you would be doing is illegal. 

I know it's "unfinished", but you need it "finished" to start operating in the first place, or else it would be considered an illegally ran business.

Also, a TOS isn't required, but not adding one would be like saying "anyone can shit the nodes", so you should also get a TOS done ASAP.

Just get your privacy policy done while NOT OPERATING/BEFORE you OPERATE next time. Also, I would shutdown your services temporary, until you write it, or else if anyone were to legally report you, you can run into IRL legal issues. (like badsk!)
Two - SteveCos You don't belong here in any way. (if you are just a member/customer, and not staff, not gonna check) Please get out and don't make me make another word with "stan" in drama.gg. Also, this provides no evidence to this post, nor this post is about that host.
SteveCos - Jamie_ This guy seriously stupid, ig we need to repeat 100 times the reason to him. It's unfinished and you keep asking like wtf this is spamming dude.
awsamboi - Two When I said "i'll remove privacy policy aswell" it was a joke, just to annoy him. We might be in wrong, but we will try our best to keep our services running and being good hosting. We have added TOS and yes, our Privacy Policy isn't the best, but I'll update it too the the "right one", don't worry about that.
Two - awsamboi I hate the fact so many people use that they "joke"d as an excuse. Never joke. This world is cruel and uses that "joke" against you. Some Discord servers have rules saying "it was a joke" is not a valid excuse for a reason.
