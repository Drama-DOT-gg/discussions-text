GamerOmega - Alright, so I found that "host" a few days ago, they offer "free" hosting with 1gb of RAM, after some digging, they were using multiple providers for their nodes and they were "magically" breaking every month, which looks like a free trial.
They don't hide the fact that they use a template for their website, but they cant even edit it properly, it always breaks as they say.
They also say that they may check servers files but all i found in their pp was just "Finding and preventing fraud", they do not state how do they do that.
They ping everyone 6 times per day in their discord guild and banning everyone who complains, aka kids logic when someone isnt agreeing with them.
They also ban people just because they vote a different opinion in polls, when someone does that they just simply ban them and remove the reaction, another childish action.
They also swear on people for no reason.
Their website is http://blare.host

I was banned just because i said that they ping everyone 4 times for one thing they say which is totally important for everyone to know. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-11/1639257323-811893-screenshot-20211212-001452-discord-canary.png
FlyingMane - I know one of the owners. He told me they over allocated the RAM of a CONTABO mode. 
To be fair tho, it's a free host so
Ples - FlyingMane yes but free host doesnt mean "hey idiot ur using my host so guess what better backup every month b****"
Aaron_ - Ples I think it does mean that.
Aaron_ - GamerOmega ssl wheya - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-12/1639326163-139007-image.png
Ples - Aaron_ ugh i have a problem on my main site basically i did ssl on it but for some reason ppl has to manually type in the https:// otherwise they wont get ssl
Ples - and its prtty annoying ngl
Oliver1234dotdot - Yo GamerOmega, I'm sorry that you got banned. But you did something to get banned.

Now first of all, we do not use free trials. I don't know if you've ever heard of Hetzner, OVH or Contabo. But as far as I see, they offer no trials. We pay for our nodes unlike some other free hosts.

And second of all, what the fuck is this? Node's going down every month? HUH? They literally don't :joy:

GamerOmega They don't hide the fact that they use a template for their website, but they cant even edit it properly, it always breaks as they say.

Never said it broke, also is it now illegal to use fucking templates? 😂 😂 😂 😂  cmon mate

GamerOmega They also say that they may check servers files but all i found in their pp was just "Finding and preventing fraud", they do not state how do they do that.

Where did we say this?

GamerOmega They ping everyone 6 times per day in their discord guild and banning everyone who complains, aka kids logic when someone isnt agreeing with them.

Also, it's my fucking server. Not yours. Do you dislike the pings? Then either mute or leave.

GamerOmega They also ban people just because they vote a different opinion in polls, when someone does that they just simply ban them and remove the reaction, another childish action.

Ah we do? Give me the proof because we did not 😃

GamerOmega They also swear on people for no reason.

Ah know I remember you. You were the one spam pinging me because I pinged @everyone.

Now to the conclusion my guy, don't fucking drama.gg a host for nothing. You got banned, and thats how it is.

@Sloth Would you please close this thread?
Oliver1234dotdot - Aaron_ We do have SSL on all of our sites, I don't know why you don't.
Oliver1234dotdot - Ples yes but free host doesnt mean "hey idiot ur using my host so guess what better backup every month b****"

When did we say that? Because we didn't.
Oliver1234dotdot - It's funny how people here try to legit destroy hosts that did nothing wrong, now to be fair I am not saying that every host didn't do something wrong and it's completely fine with you exposing it but I mean, come on, what is this bullshit of a thread?
Oliver1234dotdot - Ples Will get fixed asap.

So this proves everything 
@GamerOmega  now?
GamerOmega - Oliver1234dotdot And second of all, what the fuck is this? Node's going down every month? HUH? They literally don't :joy:

you always ping everyone in your announcements and say a node is now down, this happens literally every week, what a good host yeah

Oliver1234dotdot Never said it broke, also is it now illegal to use fucking templates? 😂 😂 😂 😂  cmon mate

your staff said that when they remove the ??$ with ??gb ram and ??gb disk(best quality plan as a host) plans it breaks, lmao

Oliver1234dotdot Where did we say this?

your discord server, another staff said they check servers files

Oliver1234dotdot Also, it's my fucking server. Not yours. Do you dislike the pings? Then either mute or leave.

if your logic is 'my server i can do anything' then why not to make it a raid community, add 10k bots, ping everyone every second and do other totally useful shit

Oliver1234dotdot Ah we do? Give me the proof because we did not 😃

ah you want a proof? sorry your dumbass banned me for complaining about pings so i cant show 😃

Oliver1234dotdot Now to the conclusion my guy, don't fucking drama.gg a host for nothing. You got banned, and thats how it is.

your host has garbage nodes which use different providers for most of them(not suspicious at all) and always crash, yes thats nothing, probably a legit host
Oliver1234dotdot - GamerOmega you always ping everyone in your announcements and say a node is now down, this happens literally every week, what a good host yeah

I would really like to see some proof of that, because if you find any theres something I missed.

GamerOmega your staff said that when they remove the ??$ with ??gb ram and ??gb disk(best quality plan as a host) plans it breaks, lmao

Yeah I said that, because I had some problems with CSS, can anyone not have problems anymore or what?

GamerOmega your discord server, another staff said they check servers files

Would surely like the proof of that 😃

GamerOmega if your logic is 'my server i can do anything' then why not to make it a raid community, add 10k bots, ping everyone every second and do other totally useful shit

Because it's my server and I don't want to add that. LOL?

GamerOmega ah you want a proof? sorry your dumbass banned me for complaining about pings so i cant show 😃

Maybe you should've not spam pinged me ? 😃

GamerOmega your host has garbage nodes which use different providers for most of them(not suspicious at all) and always crash, yes thats nothing, probably a legit host

Oh my gosh you little kid, don't you see what I just uploaded above your fucking post? Like look at the proofs my guy, I couldn't possibly have faked those within 2 minutes?.. Do my nodes always crash? Oh then theres something HetrixTools didn't monitor right here,


And oops, another one


And oops another one!


Yup that's right, DK-01 and SG-01 has been going down. But DK-01 was recently removed and theres a problem with the SG-01 node that has not yet been found. Like kiddo, get the fuck outta here, let us investigate, it literally haven't even been 2 days 😂 

GamerOmega not suspicious at all

Oh is it NOW SUSPICIOUS TO USE FUCKING NODES FROM DIFFERENT FUCKING PROVIDERS? Oh gosh kid, there's really something I've been missing out on! Literally look at what I said, Contabo, Hetzner or OVH does not provide FREE trials ffs! - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-12/1639337632-551085-image.png

GamerOmega - Oliver1234dotdot I would really like to see some proof of that, because if you find any theres something I missed.

check your own announcements maybe? oh wait you nuked it

Oliver1234dotdot Yeah I said that, because I had some problems with CSS, can anyone not have problems anymore or what?

so like you dont know what google is? a proper host wouldnt use templates and even if they would, they would apparently know how to work with just css

Oliver1234dotdot Would surely like the proof of that 😃

ask your owners or search for that

Oliver1234dotdot Maybe you should've not spam pinged me ? 😃

YOU asked for a proof, not me

Oliver1234dotdot Oh my gosh you little kid, don't you see what I just uploaded above your fucking post? Like look at the proofs my guy, I couldn't possibly have faked those within 2 minutes?.. Do my nodes always crash? Oh then theres something HetrixTools didn't monitor right here,

check. your. own. announcements. oh i forgot you nuked it

Oliver1234dotdot Oh is it NOW SUSPICIOUS TO USE FUCKING NODES FROM DIFFERENT FUCKING PROVIDERS? Oh gosh kid, there's really something I've been missing out on! Literally look at what I said, Contabo, Hetzner or OVH does not provide FREE trials ffs!


oh really? - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-12/1639339089-390642-image.png
GamerOmega - GamerOmega oh really?

also why would you ever use different providers for your nodes? theres no reason to do that, plus you showed only contabo, which is a pretty shitty vps provider as of my experience
Oliver1234dotdot - GamerOmega check your own announcements maybe? oh wait you nuked it

Oh yeah I did, because it was a fucking mess 😂 

GamerOmega so like you dont know what google is? a proper host wouldnt use templates and even if they would, they would apparently know how to work with just css

What does google have related to a fucking website theme, cmon it's a fucking theme?

GamerOmega ask your owners or search for that

My owners? I am the owner LOL

GamerOmega YOU asked for a proof, not me

This doesn't give shit proof?

GamerOmega oh really?

I'll fucking prove it to you, give me a second.
Oliver1234dotdot - GamerOmega also why would you ever use different providers for your nodes? theres no reason to do that, plus you showed only contabo, which is a pretty shitty vps provider as of my experience

Well maybe if you actually did understand something, you would know that not all the motherfucking providers has the SAME FUCKING LOCATIONS and the same FUCKING PRICES????
GamerOmega - Oliver1234dotdot My owners? I am the owner LOL

you had 2 owners
Oliver1234dotdot - This is currently my OVH account,

The one used for hosting the SG-01 node.

Red = The amount of money I paid to get a 30€ BONUS
Light green or whatever that color is = The 30€  BONUS

Not a trial 😃

My full address, card number and shit like that is also on the account, so wouldn't it be a BIT stupid to abuse? - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-12/1639339399-20695-image.png
GamerOmega - Oliver1234dotdot What does google have related to a fucking website theme, cmon it's a fucking theme?

its a template, and you can google how to use css 😱
Oliver1234dotdot - GamerOmega its a template, and you can google how to use css 😱

Ya know, not all people are great in all things right? Like cmon, you're obviously 12- years old 😃DDDDDD

And yeah it's a template, It's called CloudHub and is purchased from ThemeForest 😃 More you want to know? Contact me on Discord, Oliver...#0001. 

Oh wait, you can't. Because I forgot, your silly ass blocked me
GamerOmega - Oliver1234dotdot Well maybe if you actually did understand something, you would know that not all the motherfucking providers has the SAME FUCKING LOCATIONS and the same FUCKING PRICES????

i see how you get mad, you dont need many locations besides the us for discord bots
GamerOmega - Oliver1234dotdot Ya know, not all people are great in all things right?

thats why google exists lmao
Oliver1234dotdot - GamerOmega i see how you get mad, you dont need many locations besides the us for discord bots

We don't only provide discord bots, sorry to say but we also provide Minecraft server hosting 😃
GamerOmega - Oliver1234dotdot you're obviously 12- years old

thats what the user by nick 'oliver1234dotdot' tells me
GamerOmega - Oliver1234dotdot We don't only provide discord bots, sorry to say but we also provide Minecraft server hosting 😃

you dont need many locations for minecraft either, in the most countries you get ping 200ms which is pretty normal
Oliver1234dotdot - GamerOmega you dont need many locations for minecraft either, in the most countries you get ping 200ms which is pretty normal

The locations was requested, I'm sorry but I'm just providing my customers with the things they want? Is there now something wrong with that? Again as I said, you're more than welcome to DM me and get the Invoices screenshot if you'd like that. Also, your claims about free trials are not true, either Hetzner, Contabo or Suble does free trials my friend.
GamerOmega - GamerOmega talking about servers in the us
Oliver1234dotdot - GamerOmega thats what the user by nick 'oliver1234dotdot' tells me

I can't login with discord as the DB for that account probably is corrupted as I got it deleted some months back.
Oliver1234dotdot - Also my name on this forum, does not matter 😃
GamerOmega - Oliver1234dotdot I can't login with discord as the DB for that account probably is corrupted as I got it deleted some months back.

so apparently calling yourself 'oliver1234dotdot' which is totally a nickname of a grown man can be explained by 'your discord account being broken'
GamerOmega - Oliver1234dotdot Also my name on this forum, does not matter 😃

you can explain anything by 'it doesnt matter'
Oliver1234dotdot - GamerOmega so apparently calling yourself 'oliver1234dotdot' which is totally a nickname of a grown man can be explained by 'your discord account being broken'


Here you go, here's the fucking proof. Ask Sloth himself if I was deleted

GamerOmega you can explain anything by 'it doesnt matter'

And you can create bullshit threads because you got banned? 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-12/1639340664-279124-image.png

your services are just shit, hosts that literally work on discord are always crap
Ples - oliver is literally trash and im still sure his with badsk back in the cyperia days lol
Oliver1234dotdot - GamerOmega your services are just shit, hosts that literally work on discord are always crap

So you're saying these hosts are trash;
FranTech aka BuyVM
ColourNodes
SierraNode
PlugHost
Tideo
CryGame aka CryCloud
Advin Servers
Nexril
AspectHosts
RoyaleHosting
CrystalCloud
EU0
Oxide Host
Suble
Quack Hosting
Syd's Cloud
ArkNodes

Including MANY MANY MANY more,
So I don't get what you mean 😃
Oliver1234dotdot - Ples oliver is literally trash and im still sure his with badsk back in the cyperia days lol

I'm not with badsk, and I regret working with him. As I said before, I thought he changed when he said, turns out he didn't.
Oliver1234dotdot - GamerOmega hosts that literally work on discord are always crap

Also we only have our support departments and news on the discord, our panel is ran at https://panel.blare.host with a known panel called Pterodactyl. Our dashboard is ran at https://dash.blare.host with a known dashboard called Dashactyl. If you didn't notice 😃
Oliver1234dotdot - Ples Oh wait, hi qlox. I'm sure you're still abusing 😃?
GamerOmega - Oliver1234dotdot Also we only have our support departments and news on the discord, our panel is ran at https://panel.blare.host with a known panel called Pterodactyl. Our dashboard is ran at https://dash.blare.host with a known dashboard called Dashactyl. If you didn't notice 😃


i see thats not related to your discord server lmao - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-12/1639341237-982623-image.png
Tomas - *Some of the hosts you mentioned are pretty, well, shit &amp; some don't actually operate on Discord; they merely have Discord communities (like Quack &amp; FranTech)
Oliver1234dotdot - GamerOmega i see thats not related to your discord server lmao

Oh see, there we have it. A name "HuntMC" from the bought theme 😃
GamerOmega - Oliver1234dotdot im talking about that you login with discord to use the actual host and you have no other ways
Oliver1234dotdot - Tomas Some of the hosts you mentioned are pretty, well, shit &amp; some don't actually operate on Discord; they merely have Discord communities (like Quack &amp; FranTech)

True, and not all of them are shit but some are.
Oliver1234dotdot - GamerOmega im talking about that you login with discord to use the actual host and you have no other ways

Oh yeah that's just to make it easier for people 😃
GamerOmega - Oliver1234dotdot so you think that leaving discord the only way to use your 'services' is making it easier for users? sure lmao
Oliver1234dotdot - GamerOmega so you think that leaving discord the only way to use your 'services' is making it easier for users? sure lmao

I'm sure it is, you press one button and you're in. Easier than logging in with email and forgetting your password all the time
GamerOmega - GamerOmega you also force people to auto join your discord guild, most proper hosts wouldnt do that if they had discord login anyway
Oliver1234dotdot - GamerOmega you also force people to auto join your discord guild, most proper hosts wouldnt do that if they had discord login anyway

Yes we do, as there is important announcements on the discord.
GamerOmega - Oliver1234dotdot that doesnt mean you can remove the email way
Oliver1234dotdot - GamerOmega I'm sorry, but this is none of your fucking business? I own the host and I choose if we want login with email or not 😃 LOL
GamerOmega - Oliver1234dotdot 'important announcements' by your means is 1 announcement with 3 pings which is a pool 'move to a dedi or stay with shitty vpses' where you ban everyone if they pick stay with shitty vpses?
GamerOmega - Oliver1234dotdot ok so you just confirmed your host is shit. congrats
Oliver1234dotdot - GamerOmega I would really REALLY REALLY like to see some proof of that, because what i've known, I only banned you
Oliver1234dotdot - As I see only you, RusJS and Sandbeap were banned yesterday. RusJS was banned mistakenly. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-12/1639341724-284194-image.png
GamerOmega - Oliver1234dotdot you banned a few people with the reason 'go fucking away' pr something like that, and from what ive seen you banned them because of the poll
Oliver1234dotdot - GamerOmega you banned a few people with the reason 'go fucking away' pr something like that, and from what ive seen you banned them because of the poll

I did not ban them because of the poll, and I banned them because of some drama (not drama.gg) shit that were going around
GamerOmega - Oliver1234dotdot so whyd you ping everyone 3 times for that useless poll lmao
GamerOmega - if you ping everyone more times it doesnt mean that every member will magically come online, wake up, gets revived just to vote in your poll
Oliver1234dotdot - GamerOmega so whyd you ping everyone 3 times for that useless poll lmao

Again, none of your business. But I pinged because it was a VERY important poll.
Oliver1234dotdot - GamerOmega if you ping everyone more times it doesnt mean that every member will magically come online, wake up, gets revived just to vote in your poll

Well funny enough, because people actually magically came online to vote
GamerOmega - Oliver1234dotdot Again, none of your business. But I pinged because it was a VERY important poll.

it isnt, theres no reason to stay with shit lmao, its your choice, making polls for obvious things is dumb and pinging everyone 3 times for that poll is even dumber
GamerOmega - Oliver1234dotdot Well funny enough, because people actually magically came online to vote

from one ping, after other pings they came to mute the server
Oliver1234dotdot - GamerOmega it isnt, theres no reason to stay with shit lmao, its your choice, making polls for obvious things is dumb and pinging everyone 3 times for that poll is even dumber

Bro, obvous things? I asked if they wanted VPSes or Dedicated Servers. Are WE NOT ALLOWED TO POLL ABOUT ANYTHING ANYMORE? GOSH WHAT THE FUCK
Oliver1234dotdot - GamerOmega from one ping, after other pings they came to mute the server

Well then, they can mute the server. ?
Oliver1234dotdot - This thread is resolved as there is insufficient proof of anything in this thread, all his claims are not proven.
GamerOmega - Oliver1234dotdot Bro, obvous things? I asked if they wanted VPSes or Dedicated Servers. Are WE NOT ALLOWED TO POLL ABOUT ANYTHING ANYMORE? GOSH WHAT THE FUCK

arrarently for you it isnt obvious that a vds is better than a vps, pinging 3 times so theyll vote faster is clearly treating your 'customers' like shit
GamerOmega - Oliver1234dotdot Well then, they can mute the server. ?

so next time youll ping everyone 10 times, only 1/5 of those people will come to vote
GamerOmega - Oliver1234dotdot the kid has gave up 😔
Oliver1234dotdot - GamerOmega I am the kid now? I'm sorry but weren't it you creating a bullshit thread, weren't it you spam pinging like a child, weren't it you who blocked me without reason, weren't it you calling me out for having a "shit" username just like yours?
GamerOmega - Oliver1234dotdot weren't it you spam pinging like a child,

so spam pinging everyone for anything is not a bad thing now, ok sure

Oliver1234dotdot weren't it you who blocked me without reason

talk in the thread, not dm or spam ping me in drama.gg guild

Oliver1234dotdot weren't it you calling me out for having a "shit" username just like yours?

yes i totally have '1234' and 'dotdot' in my username which are totally a sign that youre a grown man
Oliver1234dotdot - GamerOmega 

GamerOmega yes i totally have '1234' and 'dotdot' in my username which are totally a sign that youre a grown man

And you're not much better, Gamer Omega like look at your own name.
Ples - Oliver1234dotdot no rlly not i started paying for my nodes and backstabbed plexed
Oliver1234dotdot - Ples Okay, you are still a pain in the ass tho 😃
__SECRET__ - GamerOmega if your logic is 'my server i can do anything' then why not to make it a raid community, add 10k bots, ping everyone every second and do other totally useful shit

dude, it's host 
his server
he pays for that VPS
and you all uses that for free 
so it's his choice who he wants to ban and who he wants to give service to.
__SECRET__ - @Sloth  can u delete the thread @Oliver1234dotdot  have posted his invoices of he paying for his nodes and

Aaron_ - Oliver1234dotdot You should probably be more calm if you are a staff or the owner of the host. Due to the lack of proof from GamerOmega, I will have to agree with you.
Aaron_ - GamerOmega ah you want a proof? sorry your dumbass banned me for complaining about pings so i cant show 😃

If I saw a host doing stupid things I would take screenshots and save them so that in the future I can share them.
Aaron_ - Oliver1234dotdot And the other three vpses have not so perfect uptime I should say.
Aaron_ - Oliver1234dotdot Why are you fucking screaming, calm down dude.
Aaron_ - GamerOmega  your services are just shit, hosts that literally work on discord are always crap

Now thats gonna start a war.
Sydney - Oliver1234dotdot SydsCloud is ded, AND I KILLED IT insert evil laugh here
Ples - Oliver1234dotdot so are u too
Ples - GamerOmega ... u are so wrong there are so many hosts that are actually good and use discord, ppl might say and might still say falixnodes is bad, but i recently tested their performance again and it was great i was suprised that i managed to get 20 tps, not only that they updated their store ot become plans ur server is no longer 24/7 it shutdowns after 4 hours, tbh if i didnt have my own host i wouldve probably used falixnodes.
Oliver1234dotdot - GamerOmega he treats all the members like shit

I do not, if you would like to see proof, join the discord. Oh wait, you can't 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂
__SECRET__ - Oliver1234dotdot lmao
Oliver1234dotdot - Aaron_ You should probably be more calm if you are a staff or the owner of the host.

Yes, I'm sorry for what I said but sometimes I get really heated from some bullsht thread like this, (sorry for the language again but I couldn't find any other words for it)
__SECRET__ - Sydney sure why not - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-13/1639393469-455561-image.png
Sydney - __SECRET__ Perfect gif
Oliver1234dotdot - Aaron_ And the other three vpses have not so perfect uptime I should say.

Nope I know that, DK-01 was removed I just forgot to remove it from the HetrixTools site, SG-01 is having problems and it is going to be removed too, after the reset on Wednesday. The US-01 disk has been filled as it only has 50gb nvme, I asked contabo to upgrade it but they have not answered yet.
Oliver1234dotdot - Aaron_ You are so right!
Oliver1234dotdot - Ples Well you can have your opinion about me and I can have mine about you, I think that's fair.
Oliver1234dotdot - Sydney Oof
Sydney - Oliver1234dotdot Had to make room for a better host
Oliver1234dotdot - Sydney Is it you sponsoring CygenNodes or have I misunderstood something?
Sydney - Oliver1234dotdot Owning (Part for right now, I will own it fully soon). I also own 2 others
Oliver1234dotdot - Sydney Ah okay
Ples - Oliver1234dotdot never said we couldnt have opinions
Deleted User - Yooo
Deleted User - Oliver ill handle this go get some rest.
FlyingMane - Oliver1234dotdot 
Boi you are the first guy posting about hostings... 
And complain when people call you out?
FlyingMane - GamerOmega I'll have to stop you there big guy
Oliver1234dotdot - Zachery Oliver ill handle this go get some rest.

It's only 15:37 for me :joyful:
Oliver1234dotdot - FlyingMane Boi you are the first guy posting about hostings... 
And complain when people call you out?

All the hosts I exposed, had some real shit behind it.

Blare has done absolutely nothing wrong.
FlyingMane - Oliver1234dotdot 
Hm, you have a point there
FlyingMane - Oliver1234dotdot same timezone momentum
Slayer - GamerOmega yes i totally have '1234' and 'dotdot' in my username which are totally a sign that youre a grown man

GamerOmega
GamerOmega - Ples sure lmao, you have to join 5 guilds per month just to create a server and keep it
GamerOmega - GamerOmega and basically all hosts that use discord for literally everything, creating accounts, managing accounts, giving servers and etc are typically shit, especially if you cant use email or atleast google to login
GamerOmega - GamerOmega if someone would fall for a scam while using those 'hosts' they will lose all their servers and they cant even restore them
GamerOmega - Oliver1234dotdot ive seen how you treat your users lmao, instead of just saying about a migration(you apparently dont know that vds&gt;vps), you make a poll which is basically useless and ping everyone 3 times(with ghost pings just bc you dont care about your members) for that, after that you ping everyone 3 times more bc its so important to know that you nuked announcements, that youll move to a vds and just because yes, you can atleat make a role for that instead of pinging everyone, proper hosts send out emails about maintenance and have a notice about that on their whmcs besides just pinging maintenance ping role in their discord community guild
Ples - GamerOmega no, fam gameromega ur acting like 5
GamerOmega - Ples ok, i checked and they did change it, it was requiring to join 5 guilds monthly to get free hosting, the website is just an ad trash bin and anything you try to do will show an ad
Oliver1234dotdot - GamerOmega and basically all hosts that use discord for literally everything, creating accounts, managing accounts, giving servers and etc are typically shit, especially if you cant use email or atleast google to login

No they are not. This is your opinion and you are allowed to say that, but in my opinion it is not. Either if you like it or not won't stop a single. fucking. host. from using it.
Oliver1234dotdot - GamerOmega if someone would fall for a scam while using those 'hosts' they will lose all their servers and they cant even restore them

Again, blare.host is NOT a scam.
Oliver1234dotdot - GamerOmega (you apparently dont know that vds&gt;vps),

I do know about it, and I was not asking about Virtual Dedicated Servers my friend, I was asking to switch to DEDICATED SERVERS, see look what I did there? I removed the Virtual!
Oliver1234dotdot - GamerOmega (with ghost pings just bc you dont care about your members)

Again my friend, you are mad asf that you got banned. We care about our members, no one has the same problem as you.

It's clear that we treat you like fucking shit when you create such a bullshit thread, like lmaoooo.
Go cry to your mother, and maybe in 69,420 years you will get a unban.

GamerOmega that youll move to a vds and just because yes,

Again it was important news, and again it's a dedicated server.

GamerOmega you can atleat make a role for that instead of pinging everyone

As I mentioned before, it is MY discord, you know what that equals? Yeah you guessed it, MY RULES.

Here's the proof if you don't believe I own the discord 😂 

GamerOmega proper hosts send out emails about maintenance

Okay? We don't and we are still a proper host 😃

GamerOmega whmcs

If you haven't noticed, we don't use WHMCS.. We use a popular dashboard called Dashactyl with a theme from luffy on it.



Ples no, fam gameromega ur acting like 5

Finally something we can agree on!

GamerOmega ok, i checked and they did change it, it was requiring to join 5 guilds monthly to get free hosting, the website is just an ad trash bin and anything you try to do will show an ad

I would like to see the proof of us making you join 5 discord servers, because then there's clearly something broken with my client area.

pov: youre a 10 year old kid who is really mad

Oliver1234dotdot Again it was important news, and again it's a dedicated server.

most dedicated servers are running using virtualization just to prevent you from breaking it

Oliver1234dotdot As I mentioned before, it is MY discord, you know what that equals? Yeah you guessed it, MY RULES.

you force people to join your shitty server, i havent asked for you to do that

Oliver1234dotdot Okay? We don't and we are still a proper host 😃

proper hosts dont rely on 3rd party platforms like discord to do everything

Oliver1234dotdot If you haven't noticed, we don't use WHMCS.. We use a popular dashboard called Dashactyl with a theme from luffy on it.

dashactyl is also used by skid hosts, noone cancelled that, and using some magic you can add announcement fields on it too 😱 

Oliver1234dotdot I would like to see the proof of us making you join 5 discord servers, because then there's clearly something broken with my client area.
As you clearly see here, there's only the blare guild in here.

it was about falix lmao, did you even read the reply
GamerOmega - GamerOmega you force people to join your shitty server, i havent asked for you to do that

actual proper hosts never do that, if they have a support server they dont force you to join, they have everything made through web and email, check something.host as an example.
and the funniest part in discord hosts is that when you leave the server, your account gets deleted, if you get banned, your account on your host gets banned too, its just called forcing and is dumb
Oliver1234dotdot - GamerOmega Oh! Well blare ain't deleting users accounts when you leave, as you can clearly see by the screenshots provided here;
Pterodactyl users

Discord users


And again, we are not a "discord host", we're a free host making free hosting for people who cannot afford it - dont want to pay for servers. I know free hosts has kinda destroyed the market, but it's not gonna stop me being kind to people and giving away free servers.
Now if you don't like our services, then please stop calling us out for nothing.
As I said before, go cry to your mom or dad because this isn't going to do anything, and I hope you know that. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-13/1639425896-54363-image.png

GamerOmega - Oliver1234dotdot Oh! Well blare ain't deleting users accounts when you leave, as you can clearly see by the screenshots provided here;

so when you get banned your account gets banned too&gt; thats a discord host then lmao

Oliver1234dotdot we are not a "discord host"

if you arent, add email accounts or google accounts atleast, if somsone scams an account the host account will get hacked too, that wont happen with email, same for tickets, add email tickets or atleast web tickets if you arent a discord host

Oliver1234dotdot As I said before, go cry to your mom or dad because this isn't going to do anything, and I hope you know that.

imagine a kid raging lmao
GamerOmega - Oliver1234dotdot Again, blare.host is NOT a scam.

if someone scams a user of your host and steals an account, the servers on the host will be stolen with no problems, thats what i meant
SamCoThePug - freemc is a discord host
SamCoThePug - and u just go looking for free hosts for india nodes
Oliver1234dotdot - GamerOmega if someone scams a user of your host and steals an account, the servers on the host will be stolen with no problems, thats what i meant

That's why users should use 2FA on their discord account and Pterodactyl account 😃
Oliver1234dotdot - SamCoThePug Exactly, he's mad that I banned him and blacklisted him from our dashboard.
GamerOmega - Oliver1234dotdot That's why users should use 2FA on their discord account and Pterodactyl account 😃

2fa doesnt help anything on discord, most scams these days just disable it when stealing the token, and im pretty sure pterodactyl one can be bruteforced
GamerOmega - Oliver1234dotdot Exactly, he's mad that I banned him and blacklisted him from our dashboard.

same logic as saying that the founder is mad because i opened a thread on drama
SamCoThePug - GamerOmega ptero one got patched, and about the discord tihng, why dont the users just not be fucking retards like you?
Oliver1234dotdot - GamerOmega Well then, you just said it yourself.

Emails are unsecure like discord too huh?

GamerOmega same logic as saying that the founder is mad because i opened a thread on drama

I am not, you're just wanting to get a server in singapore, I'm sorry my man, it's already full and you can first come back in 69,420 years 😃
Oliver1234dotdot - SamCoThePug Exactly
GamerOmega - SamCoThePug apparently you havent seen the new scams, some scammers even get a fake game certified on discord which is actually a tokenlogger
SamCoThePug - GamerOmega Why dont they just not download the game lol, theyre just retards like you 😃
SamCoThePug - Pretty easy to check a file in virustotal
GamerOmega - Oliver1234dotdot I am not, you're just wanting to get a server in singapore, I'm sorry my man, it's already full and you can first come back in 69,420 years 😃

singapore has ping 300ms to discord which is not good for bots lmao, and dont worry i have my own server
GamerOmega - SamCoThePug they can make it hidden, they can obfuscate it, its actually easy to prevent a virus showing up as a virus
SamCoThePug - Okay well they can just be not dumb then?
SamCoThePug - The only virus you have is autism
GamerOmega - SamCoThePug lmao, i love how you try to look cool but actually you cant even properly talk
Oliver1234dotdot - GamerOmega Okay stop the crap my man, stop your fale accusations without any fucking proof.
Oliver1234dotdot - SamCoThePug LMAOO SO TRUE
Oliver1234dotdot - GamerOmega You're the one calling a host out for literally nothing, oh yeah I'm sorry we banned you and removed your account, go cry as I said. No one gives a fuck.
Jamie_ - GamerOmega which looks like a free trial.

Funny, didn't know contabo, ovh and hetzner had free trials.
Jamie_ - GamerOmega They also ban people just because they vote a different opinion in polls

You spam pinged the owner, what the literal fuck did you expect
Oliver1234dotdot - Jamie_ 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂
Jamie_ - FlyingMane He told me they over allocated the RAM of a CONTABO mode.

As their developer, I can confirm this is not true.
FlyingMane - Oliver1234dotdot 
They use CONTABO man. 
CONTABO is a decent platform for free hosts. And they don't offer free trials so idk why this thread even exists
@Robert please close this thread, it has just random accusations
Jamie_ - I am sorry, but this is a free host. What the hell do you expect. 10 i9 dedis with 128gb of ddr4 ram? Bro they are trying to make a place were people can make a minecraft server to play with their friends for free, or host their community bot for free. They are not running nasa or google or whatever. Get a grip.
FlyingMane - Jamie_ 
This absolutely. Don't expect a free host to have the same speed as an OVH gaming node yk?
SamCoThePug - GamerOmega Sorry man, but i think thats a bit of a #UnoReverse #Ratio #DIdntAsk moment, also i think its you that cant talk. I can talk perfectly fine lad
__SECRET__ - GamerOmega so like you dont know what google is? a proper host wouldnt use templates and even if they would, they would apparently know how to work with just css

CSS is kinda hard for beginners and I think who the hell I am telling you so here is a short intro
 
I am SECRET a Jr web developer and beginner python developer  

and now back to CSS if u think we can just edit the website from its panel it's done in WordPress theme 
and  they are using a template that is not for WordPress so they have to change it from their code editor


Edit: dafaq bitch who the hell in this world said you cannot use a  template mofo everyone uses a template even cube hosting, MC world, and other tooo use a template for there main website ididot
__SECRET__ - GamerOmega sarcasm 
okokokok let's talk about it u think u can do a shit ton of stuff with google 
I will pay $50 to make me a good website with react.js and it should also have WHMCS
GamerOmega - Oliver1234dotdot Okay stop the crap my man, stop your fale accusations without any fucking proof.

you cant read ig

Oliver1234dotdot You're the one calling a host out for literally nothing

youre the one swearing at your customers and pinging everyone for any changes

Jamie_ Funny, didn't know contabo, ovh and hetzner had free trials.

ovh does

SamCoThePug Sorry man, but i think thats a bit of a #UnoReverse #Ratio #DIdntAsk moment, also i think its you that cant talk. I can talk perfectly fine lad

i didnt ask you to talk here then?

__SECRET__ dafaq bitch who the hell in this world said you cannot use a  template mofo everyone uses a template

sure, google is a template, youtube is a tempate, discord is a template

__SECRET__ react.js

ew
GamerOmega - Jamie_ As their developer, I can confirm this is not true.

how do you expect a free host with around 300 servers and most of them have 1gb ram to not overallocate
Oliver1234dotdot - GamerOmega youre the one swearing at your customers and pinging everyone for any changes

You're not my customer
IoNetty - My god. I'm getting bored of this thread popping up in my feed. So i'm gonna clear some crap up. 

Blare overallocating. Well, this can't really be proved directly unless a admin proves it, which they probably wont. Later i'll check how much swap is on there server when I have some spare time.
Blare using trial nodes. Well, there is a few sides of this. I know Contabo has no trials, Hetzner cloud has a 20 euro credit, which if you read the pictures has already been used. OVH, as shown already Oliver has already exhausted his OVH credits or he has not gotten any on signup, can't all of you understand something that has already been proven.

My god. People these days don't understand common sense. Please, if you say something prove it. Don't make lifeless accusations if there not worth anything. If you mind oliver, can you provide a picture of htop &amp; neofetch so I don't have to get off my ass?

Alright for GamerOmega, prove your claims before you say them.
Oliver1234dotdot - IoNetty We do indeed overallocate, we have around 16-32gb swap on each node. But what do you expect, we're a free host and we can't run without overallocation
IoNetty - Oliver1234dotdot fair, but you should say that your doing it to prevent stuff like this
LordOlympia - What's the whole point of this now really? I mean I think everything is answered at this point.
IoNetty - LordOlympia yep
Oliver1234dotdot - LordOlympia It's already said here, overallocation is not even a reason to try to shutdown a host by opening a thread here with 99 other false assucations.

And it really pisses me off that people accuse me for abusing, when I actually pay my invoices
Jamie_ - GamerOmega how do you expect a free host with around 300 servers and most of them have 1gb ram to not overallocate

Let me rephrase, they don’t to the point that it affects performance. Like I said, it’s a free host. Not nasas space servers or whatever. I would have killed for a service like this as a kid just to be able to have a server with my friends. Everything runs smoothly when i dev there and works fine. No free trials I can confirm and no issues.
Oliver1234dotdot - Jamie_ Thank you for replying, it's true. This GamerOmega guy is obviously mad asf that I banned him.
__SECRET__ - GamerOmega ew

woah bitch who the fuck are you 
baby go play with your kitty 
it feels like I am babysitting lil AllSafe
__SECRET__ - GamerOmega sure, google is a template, youtube is a tempate, discord is a template

well if they want then can make it open-source and make it a template....

__SECRET__ - SirCat agrees.
SirCat - @GamerOmega just leave d.gg please, and stop trying to ruin olivers host as far as i know i dont see anything that is so wrong that it has to be put on drama.gg
SirCat - besides his the owner he is allowed and has the right to remove staff or ban anyone he wants as he owns the host.
__SECRET__ - need to report  his local authorities cuz a child on drugs
SirCat - __SECRET__ yes pls
__SECRET__ - SirCat he lives in India though
SirCat - anyways @GamerOmega u clearly dont know what your talking about so kindly just delete this thread or smthing blare host rlly has done nothing wrong
SirCat - __SECRET__ this will sound weird in a special way, but like everyone i meet online is either from india or singapore
SirCat - @GamerOmega = i got banned, imma end this mans whole career.
__SECRET__ - SirCat lmao i am indian too
SirCat - __SECRET__ BRO WHAT, MAN I JUST WANNA FIND SOMEONE SWEDISH!

__SECRET__ - GamerOmega Заткнись, хотя кто просил
Oliver1234dotdot - GamerOmega You don't know SirCat? It's qlox 😂
Ples - @GamerOmega listen fam, i run my own host called KittenNodes we use the same social platform discord, why? well alot of people use discord, and it even helped our growth, and by using discord we wont have to make our own forum or own chatting platform to quickly communicate with our customers or normal users, besides blare has done nothing wrong you clearly got mad over a ban smh, and rn your trying to kill olivers host, smh so inmature.
Ples - and thats prob why blare does the same, not only that tons of hosts uses discord
Ples - and btw im sircat, im just not at school rn so i have to use this acc.
GamerOmega - Ples youre clearly the one who has dnd 24/7 and never checks his pings on discord lmfao
SirCat - GamerOmega no? besides ur like 9 u just got pissed for being banned in a server u dont own he had all rights to ban u if he felt like it just grow up and gtfo
GamerOmega - SirCat 'ur' learn how to speak properly atleast
Slayer - Blare Host puts incomplete stuff to production, alot of example stuff from Tabler, free dashboard template. Didn't unfortunately take a screenshot of that, but hey what do you expect from "hostings" operated by this dumbfuck.

Their store looks like "what the fuck literally". Why i have to type numbers in order to buy something lol. Also its not disclosed if i have to type the coin amount there or the resource.


Alongside from that, their "Earn coins" is easily abuseable with doing LinkVertise quests with AdGuard which bypasses everything. The only authentication method to login to Blare Host is only Discord. lol, is this a Discord related host at all? Oliver, little note: Just make ur own authentication, if you have any coding experience at all : D.

Dashboard is broken, because they are "resetting" some stuff. They are basically just removing everyone's data, important or not. Why would anyone do that? - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-15/1639576065-352836-image.png

Edit: feel free to talk shit about me 😉 i would like to hear

That was an old picture of our theme while it was clearly in DEVELOPMENT.
VenixDev - Also, we had informed all clients that everything would be wiped since we started from the scratch again with stable nodes.
Jamie_ - Slayer The only authentication method to login to Blare Host is only Discord. lol, is this a Discord related host at all? Oliver, little note: Just make ur own authentication, if you have any coding experience at all : D.

Well I mean, its a discord host, and if you have any sort of knowledge of the modern hosting community, you would have heard of Dashactyl. It allows you to use pterodactyl with Discord Authentication. It is 10x more secure as you don't store users data like passwords and that and instead a more trusted company like discord does. Even paid hosts use discord as an authentication method.
Jamie_ - Slayer Why would anyone do that?

I cannot tell if you are being serious or not? Lots of free hosts do it. It is a free host. They do it to allow actual customers to have room on the nodes and to make it better for customers.
Oliver1234dotdot - Slayer As announced before, it was made a poll about getting more VPSes or getting Dedicated Servers instead, including resetting all data if dedicated servers was selected. There was pinged MULTIPLE times before the reset, and people had around 5 days to backup all of their data so everyone had the time to do it.
Oliver1234dotdot - Now don't get mad that you were kicked 😃
Oliver1234dotdot - GamerOmega plus you showed only contabo

If you're not blind you would've noticed that I put my hetzner invoice there too..
Aaron_ - GamerOmega Pretty sure I saw some hetzner invoices.
SirCat - GamerOmega dipshit ur is your its called shorten words retard
Slayer - Oliver1234dotdot fair enough. if thats the case, i apologize for that. i was originally pissed off to the "free trial" accusation, but seems like u already proofed that you are not a "free trialer" : D 

i wont be making negative comments of this host anymore (hopefully)
Jamie_ - Slayer i was originally pissed off to the "free trial" accusation, but seems like u already proofed that you are not a "free trialer" : D

They defo do not use free trials I can guarantee that, they buy VPSs from my host.
Oliver1234dotdot - Jamie_ And we buy dedicated servers from Hetzner, we also have bought VPSes at Contabo, Suble, Tideo and BuyVM but we do not have those VPSes anymore.
Deveroonie - Oliver1234dotdot Including MANY MANY MANY more,

skysilk uses discord and aren't they one of the BIGGEST vps hosts in the world
__SECRET__ - Slayer The only authentication method to login to Blare Host is only Discord. lol, is this a Discord related host at all? Oliver, little note: Just make ur own authentication, if you have any coding experience at all : D.

sweetie,

__SECRET__ - Slayer example stuff from [Tabler](httpmplate now a a crime

Slayer Blare Host puts incomplete stuff to production, alot of example stuff from Tabler, free dashboard template. Didn't unfortunately take a screenshot of that, but hey what do you expect from "hostings" operated by this dumbfuck.
