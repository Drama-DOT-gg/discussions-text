clonx - I just discovered this host called "Latinhost" that literally sells minecraft servers hosted on contabo.
They lie about their hardware saying that they offer servers with "i7-67000" like wtf.



And they also go against Arc's recommendation by saying to it's users to AFK on their page with Arc's widget.


their webpage is latinhost.net (spanish) - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-08/1620443591-713858-unknown.png
