Toki0179 - I just want to start off by saying I'm not a perfect person either and I was considering nulling something (I ended up deciding not to) But this is QuackHosts thread and not one about me.
I would like to start with the fact that they used nulled argon theme for pterodactyl

and if you don't believe it is nulled ask him for proof he paid for it (hint: he won't provide it) He isn't using that theme now because v1 doesn't support it. 

Next thing I would like to say is that he is obsessed with being professional but when I decided to leave the host and not be a part of it anymore he banned me from the website with the ban reason being noob !


Another thing that I'm pretty sure is straight up illegal is their policies (or lack of policies) their privacy policy does not seem to be written properly such as they are missing the section for GDPR regulations and some other important sections


They do not have Terms of Service. The page for it is just blank and the same applies for all other ones except from the privacy policy (that isn't even properly finished).


Last thing I would like to say is that after I left J05H tried to say I lied about my age and that I was unprofessional etc. According to josh "idk why tf he is so childish, he is NOT 15." I guess my passport must be wrong then. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-09-30/1601487963-113452-image.png

Saqib - Isnt there an attach button when you wrote the thread Toki0179
Toki0179 - Saqib yeah i didnt see it lol
Jpaul - cool
nice
Withdrawal - All the facts Olliwes has spoke are true.
HCS - What about the fact you where targeting his host and "abusing" quackcoins?
Withdrawal - Also, I don't know if this is true. He owns a company named "SomaDesigns".
I won a giveaway in there, a nitro giveaway, Josh said to me he is going to give me 5$ because I already had nitro, guess what:
Also, using bot clients:

Also, here is proof that he needs to still give me my 5$ - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-09-30/1601488498-129549-quackhost.png

Toki0179 - HCS I exploited a bug on your website with someone else because you guys don't know how to make a website
Toki0179 - HCS also it only gave me quackcoins that i never used
Withdrawal - HCS 

It was a bug in their system. We weren't targeting his host, we were testing if there is any possible way to abuse his client page, it turns out there was a way. I've told his developer to fix it and he did.
J0SH - lmao
J0SH - firstly this is about quackhost. not somadesigns, i was having a fucking laugh pretending i didnt remember lmao
J0SH - v1 was not the reason i removed argon
Toki0179 - Also I have no real evidence for this anymore but he hosted some fake giveaways in his server soma designs derp is some proof look above. I won one too and never got my prize
Withdrawal - J0SH 

Still the same, you own QuackHost and SomaDesigns, this thread is about you and QuackHost.
J0SH - also lemme just say that OLLIWES was my friend, and hes just randomly turned on me...
J0SH - i literally said i would give him Â£20 for his host and he does this
J0SH - Toki0179 that was a bug that was fixed ages ago
HCS - Withdrawal I said how and you said "you will probs tell him"
Toki0179 - wow now your buddy is trying to hide it by calling it a "shitpost" - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-09-30/1601489168-801470-image.png
J0SH - oh and btw he definitely doesnt use nulled whmcs - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-09-30/1601489226-718087-image.png
Deleted User - i defend josh
this is a bs post
Withdrawal - J0SH 

I told him after that it's not really a good thing to null stuff, the thing he did is bad, and I agree with you Josh, he shouldn't have done that.
J0SH - the only thing on here which is actually my fault is the policies arent finished
Toki0179 - J0SH as i said at the top of the post i said im not perfect either and admitted to doing stuff like this
Toki0179 - i shouldnt have done it tbh it was me being dumb
Withdrawal - J0SH Where is your ToS? You just have a privacy policy
J0SH - also wheres your proof that i said that thing abuot you being 15
Deleted User - i dont think theres a tos..
Withdrawal - ThatBad There is no ToS. The ToS page is just blank.
Toki0179 - J0SH i have the message.txt file if u want me to send it
Deleted User - no tos to be seen on the discord either
J0SH - ok lemme explain this bs
Deleted User - yes josh good idea
J0SH - ThatBad according to falixnodes thats not needed since they dont have one...
Deleted User - lemme have a look
Deleted User - theres a tos tho
https://falixnodes.net/terms-and-conditions.php
Deleted User - its a terms and conditions page but its the same thing tbh
Withdrawal - J0SH 
https://falixnodes.net/terms-and-conditions.php
Toki0179 - proof i have the message from u - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-09-30/1601489663-383056-image.png
J0SH - OLLIW3S was actually in the host when we used argon. so he cant say shit. I removed it when he left because it was nulled but that was ages ago. He actually agreed to using nulled argon.

The reason i removed it was because it was nulled. my members will be able to back me up on the fact it hasn't been on for a while now.

I actually banned him because he was abusing the host with a quackcoins bug and getting unlimited quackcoins. the noob reason was just needed.

Yes, our privacy policy isn't finished but when someone asks for it we do provide a written version.
According to FalixNodes, ToS isn't needed, since I don't see one on their website, do you? or am i just blind.
I said he was acting childish, this is a whole other story that i can't be arsed explaining
J0SH - yehg ok falixnodes has tos
J0SH - Toki0179 wat message
Deleted User - y
J0SH - oh the childish thing
Withdrawal - J0SH 

He didn't get unlimited coins, AYS did. Yeah the first sentence is true, I think he agreed using argon. I'm not sure.
J0SH - the only thing that applies to this is website-law compliance since we dont use nulled software and we havent used it for a month and a half. we got rid of everything when olliwes left to start a fresh start. illegal activity, where?
AYS - J0SH Proof of olliw3s agreeing to use nulled argon?
Deleted User - ays is a complete idiot ngl
Toki0179 - J0SH also i would like to say that this thread is not about me...
J0SH - Withdrawal he did will post proof when i find it
Withdrawal - J0SH 

What about your other company SomaDesigns, do you have any proof that you have a valid license for xenforo?
Withdrawal - Remember, this is about QuackHost and you.
J0SH - AYS no idea where ill find it but ill look thru dms
Withdrawal - ThatBad 

Well, he is sometimes, not always.
J0SH - it was in the old staffchat im sure from the server he gave away (thats a whole other story)
J0SH - Toki0179 i know just saying you cant expose someone for something when you do it yourself
J0SH - Withdrawal no, dont have a license but not nulled, i havent touched somadesigns in like 3 months, so no idea why this is relevant
J0SH - either way if olliwes agreed to nulling or not it still doesnt apply since we dont do it anymore
Withdrawal - J0SH The post is about you and QuackHost. And how is it not nulled if you don't have a license?
Withdrawal - J0SH True.
Deleted User - hm
J0SH - im not rly arsed about this winterhoax since every free host has been done now...
Saqib - E Not mine lol
J0SH - Withdrawal a friend gave me the files not 100% sure whether its nulled or not but if its about me and quackhost, then why is the post titles quackhost, and somadesigns is not ME because i havent done anything with it in 3 months and Kurama also owns it
Deleted User - ok is this shit over
J0SH - nope
J0SH - waiting for winterhoax admins to join
Withdrawal - J0SH Hmmm. I believe you.
J0SH - Withdrawal sarcastic or?
Withdrawal - J0SH Nop.
J0SH - oh just another little thing, if i banned him for "leaving the host" that is for a valid reason. @Withdrawal can back me up about the fact he actually stole the discord from me and withdrawal and gave it away to a random person.
J0SH - he didnt just leave the host, he fucked the host up in his tracks. ofc thats gonna make me want to ban him from visiting the host in future.
J0SH - im also finishing the policies as we speak
J0SH - and proof that olliwes gave the server to a random person, which is HCS (was random at the time) - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-09-30/1601492116-556598-image.png
HCS - J0SH He did a first to react got the server and I thought "why not"
J0SH - why does that matter? thats even worse.
HCS - J0SH was giving context lol, just to be clear I let J0SH advertise he new host in the server once he explained the truth to me
Deleted User - J0SH falix has everything public on their website
Deleted User - Don't make false accusations please
Toki0179 - J0SH I agree. Also I agree I shouldn't have even thought about nulling WHMCS if I ever want to get something that costs money I will be paying for it
Toki0179 - Jeekie what did he say about falixnodes
Deleted User -  - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-09-30/1601493456-236284-screenshot-2020-09-30-20-17-16-56.jpeg
J0SH - @Jeekie i said i couldnt find it because i just said then that i was blind and didnt see it
J0SH - (not actually blind. sarcastic)
Deleted User - Kk
Toki0179 - J0SH but why even try send for falixnodes. This is a thread about you and not them.
J0SH - https://quackhost.net/legal/privacy-policy.html is finished
J0SH - Toki0179 was just referring to falixnodes as not needing a tos but was wrong
Toki0179 - J0SH It hasn't had anything added. It is missing plenty of things
J0SH - no its not
J0SH - huh? - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-09-30/1601494663-734922-image.png
J0SH - hasnt had anything added?
J0SH - pretty sure its been finished check ur cache lmao
JosieV - This thread HERE is applicable to this service too
KejiDiscord - J0SH josh im part of ur discord server. My mcpe server is running smoothly and ur services are good. Pls dont mind them. Also. Doesnt make sence that thet guy already had nitro when he won the giveaway right? Expect if hes gonna gift it to some one
Toki0179 - JosieV this is a thread about quackhost not falixnodes
Toki0179 - KejiDiscord they are a good host but some scummy things. That is the same for most hosts tbh tho
J0SH - some scummy things, like what?
KingRektYou - J0SH you are paying people Â£20 for a hosting company, surely thatâs a massive red flag Lmaoooo?
KingRektYou - 90% of Hosting companies who have Host/Nodes in their name are garbage, you are no exception.

Why the heck would you ban someone for ânoobâ regardless of what they did, abused a system or not, there should have been a proper actual ban reason, if the ban is valid.

Grow up, stop trying to make some pocket money by running a shitty host, and pay for the stuff you use. you are legit using nulled software, whilst trying to make a profit on your own company. How do you think theme creators make money?
Toki0179 - KingRektYou they are paying more now cause they are buying hetzner dedicated servers.
Withdrawal - KejiDiscord 

You are really defending him. I won nitro in his server, I already had nitro and he said he is going to give me 5$, which he didn't. So stop defending him about that
Jedrik - What's this quackhost shit I thought this shit was a joke, seems like it actually is a joke
Withdrawal - Jedrik 

Yeah, seems like it is
J0SH - KingRektYou huh? i said i would donate Â£20 to olliwes' hosting..?
J0SH - its not how much i pay for the nodes its how much i was going to donate to him to help him get his first node
J0SH - Withdrawal i am stalling u but i will give it eventually
J0SH - KingRektYou were not "using" nulled software, we "used" nulled software, over a month ago so fuck off. i havent made any fucking profits since i put it all back into the host. the drama between me and OLLIW3S was solved over discord. do not get your nosy ass in on it.
J0SH - also just because a host has nodes/host in their name doesn't mean its bad, that's a stereotype.
J0SH -  - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-10-01/1601562129-464600-image.png
Jedrik - J0SH Doesn't change shit, you use it then you use it. Think about your actions.
AYS - Confirmed: Using nulled theme.
J0SH - huh? were not using a nulled theme
J0SH - Jedrik already thought about my actions, thats why i removed it a month ago idot
J0SH - u wanna change it to "used" because people will come to this and think im still using a nulled fucking theme ty
AYS - You used nulled theme yes.
Toki0179 - its been a full day and his tos is still not there hm
J0SH - shh
Jedrik - You used nulled theme, you use nulled theme. Don't "I thought about my actions idiot" me, it ain't my fault you're a desperate sad and low-funded host ran by a crybaby of an owner.
J0SH - wait so u think you can say that about me just because i used a theme i wasnt supposed to be using?
J0SH - and i said idot on purpose didnt say idiot
J0SH - toxic cunt
Jedrik - J0SH to quackhost users this is the level of professionalism the person who runs your servers has
Toki0179 - J0SH welp someone just got suspended from winterhoax for 5 days
Jedrik - Toki0179 yikes
Toki0179 - Jedrik yeah he got suspended for calling u that. he deserved it. The more he replies to this post the more I believe he deserved this whole post. He is just proving my points even further.
X_Shadow_ - Hello all, I'm the dev of the dashboard and the only one with DB access.

About the "noob" ban, OLLIWES got banned before for the following reason "Banned from our discord server" but got the reason changed bcs he was still abusing it.

QuackHost really improved the past days, (Getting two VPS + a dedi) and we are not using nulled software like other companies who used some leaked dashboards / ptero extensions.

If you have any questions about the dashboard or anything, tell me as I'm here to answer
Toki0179 - X_Shadow_ thats funny cause the reason this was confirmed was because you guys had nulled argon theme for pterodactyl
Toki0179 - X_Shadow_ also how do i abuse a ban.php page
edit: I mean banned.php
Toki0179 - also that is still a very unprofessional ban reason. You should have written something else for the reason.
KejiDiscord - Withdrawal Well if he really have scammed u...... Well, I am Changing sides.
X_Shadow_ - @Withdrawal Josh told me he did not scammed you, but he don't have the money rn
Toki0179 - X_Shadow_ then why does he host a giveaway if he doesn't have the money. Hm I think he is making excuses to be hosting fake giveaways.
X_Shadow_ - Sorry for the spam, my reply wouldn't get threw but looks like it did
KejiDiscord - Toki0179  now this makes COMMON SENCE
Plactrix - From J0SH: Derp Studios is withdrawal

I was asked by J0SH to post this due to his account being suspended - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-10-03/1601717963-35853-unknown-7.png
Withdrawal - Toki0179 He didn't scam me, he had no money I believe, I thought it was a scam first, because it took like 2 months for him to send it. He finally sent it, so I believe it's not a scam..
Toki0179 - Withdrawal I know but what im saying is that he hosts giveaways when he doesn't have the money. He should just wait until he has the money to host them.
J0SH - unsuspended cool
Justin - Toki0179 hold my fucking tits

https://justinpooters.nl/templates/hoststart that mf stole my site.
eraters - who would even want to use a template not compatible on mobile lmao
Saqib - Justin if it's free how did he steal it?
NeilGamingYT - ok so i just saw that he tried to turn the decision to falix so this is what i say "Falix nodes have everything public and you can check it anytime on the site and they are also professional"
Keko - Ah yes! The best server owner joking about drugs! :D - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-11-15/1605474647-215800-image.png
Tomas - Keko yeah joking lol
Tomas - Keko also


modified client??
modified client??!!
Korudo - Message Logger V2 Better discord????
Keko - Tomas Joe gave it to me (the picture)

Korudo what's that?
eraters - yeah i think i fucked that person.. let me think. yeah it was joe mamma
Tomas - Keko omg, tell joe i love him
joe is so cool
luffy - Quack host had made this event where they offer a vps for 2 discord boosts ive boosted over a month ago and it ended yesterday still no vps and as days go on its starting to look like a scam
J0SH - When I said that, I didn't realise we would go from 2 boosts to 31 boosts in a matter of days. I talked about this in the booster channel and said It has ended.
J0SH - If I gave the VPS's we'd be paying way too much for subnets which would make quackhost bankrupt.
luffy - i was the 3rd person to boost twice after u had announced
luffy - and in boosters channel u said u would be giving everyone with a IPV6 and we had agreed to that
J0SH - Your the one that kept your boost after I said it was ended
J0SH - luffy When I didn't realise the ipv6 subnet had one ipv6 in it
luffy - i boosted before it ended u give 1 person the vps tell everyone to share from him and end thats not fair now is it?
MicroBot - This is a scam lol luffy did boost.
Big fat scam
onyx - never believe boost rewards like that unless it's a reputable source like dank memer
EdwardSnowde - I have had a lot of experience with QuackHost, ( I actually saved their asses) and I had all my servers good. I had a reliable VPS (that was given to me for free because I donated a lot) It later got canceled, and reinstated with Tilted Host. I know the VPS booster thing was a "scam" but, still he wasnt expecting like 500 people to boost
Bear - EdwardSnowde well, he should have known better.
Ash777 - Bear ya like 1 of my friend got scammed

EmeraldMike - Sloth  QuackHost,
We pull slots out of our ass that we don't rlly have just to keep interest.
BlackCat - Well its free host its okay that they overallocate the nodes, its useless for them to get expensive nodes when they can held like 30 servers without overallocating. My server had 10 players with 20tps. Well my question is why the donator nodes have bigger cpu usage then the free nodes. Quackhost isnt bad host.
J0SH - Eh, It's not dead its just in limbo lol
J0SH - Sloth GEFR1 &amp; 2 was locked due to a ddos attack by one of our members, they aren't "dying".
J0SH - outgoing ddos attack*
Sloth - Well, have fun sustaining your host with that income.
J0SH - yeah, i'll have alot of fun

Nova - Withdrawal exactly
J0SH - Can't argue with bad services, it's a fucking free host. Give me a break.
Nova - J0SH to bad so sad, life is so unfair~~
INfoUpgraders - J0SH there are many free hosts that don't have bad services
J0SH - INfoUpgraders i didn't ask

Withdrawal - J0SH lmfao easy, I broke your client area
Nova - Withdrawal  LOL
J0SH - Withdrawal that one that's not finished you mean?
Withdrawal - J0SH No lmfao, client.quackhost.uk
J0SH - ain't mine dumb ass
INfoUpgraders - can confirm client panel not working
Withdrawal - J0SH Still, you own quackhost, that technically means you still own the fucking client panel, and you worked on the client panel before, so don't try to get out of this mess
J0SH - what mess, it's only the client panel
Daftscientist - Tomas i own pterodev.com lmfao and that dns record got deleted. :/
EstCraft - what the actual fu*k is going on?
Daftscientist - j0sh being a dick, so nothing new.
J0SH - What did I ever do to you daft?
J0SH - You demoted me to member for absolutely no reason, so I resigned and you made a big fuss out of it so I blocked you?
PugRug - wtf daft never knew u swear
PugRug - im fine with it but never knew keke
Daftscientist - PugRug see how mad this makes me then.
J0SH - Mad at who for what reason?
Daftscientist - J0SH whenever i ask you something or try to make conv in dms you blow me off and swear and shout at me, ive not said this to you before bc unlike you i value peoples feelings. So i kept it quiet. But this was the last straw. you blocking me and swearing loudly at me is not nice and its mean (lmfao i sound like a 3yr old kid. but nvm) i dont take harrassment, and note it was never my idea to demote you in the first place I WAS THE ONE FUCKING DEFENDING YOU INFRONT OF INFO AND WITHDRAWL AND YOU STILL BE MEAN TO BE.
i rest my case
J0SH - Sorry mate, you can blame my environment for that one.
EstCraft - J0SH is good
EstCraft - J0SH yes lmao
Daftscientist - J0SH hmm, or you can take the blame like a real man?
PugRug - Daftscientist omg
Daftscientist - anyway when josh is not being a shithead hes a fine person
PugRug - daft going all out sheeeshhh
J0SH - I swear at you partly because of my nature, You were clearly not defending me.


"perhaps just demote him if you rly want to"

Daftscientist - J0SH the other option was you being banned and the demotion was to dev or to head dev. i never expected you to be demoted to member.
J0SH - banned for?
Daftscientist - J0SH idfk i still defended you, info gave a load of evidence (that idk if i can share) that proved you mean and how your client is bad and could ruin pterodev
J0SH - Info doesn't even have the fucking code. It wasn't finished.
INfoUpgraders - J0SH take responsibility for your own actions idiot
Nova - ,_, this is hilarious
J0SH - INfoUpgraders what actions
Nova - J0SH read the thread already, explains it
J0SH - He's not on about the thread, he's on about pterodev
Nova - oh
Nova - welp this has gotten boring
INfoUpgraders - J0SH no i'm not, learn what you're reading lol
INfoUpgraders - you were demoted for being extremely unprofessional &amp; inappropriate in tickets, not behavior that we represent or tolerate. you're SaaS panel was completely mispresented as well
LordOlympia - J0SH Oh... pretty sure its about this thread
J0SH - INfoUpgraders I know I was demoted for that, even Daft said I shouldn't had been demoted to member though
Sydney - J0SH AH yes, like a free host can not supply good services to its client. You make me laugh
INfoUpgraders - J0SH other actions like banning members multiple times for no reason listed was also it
J0SH - INfoUpgraders it wasn't no reason, I've told both daft and luffy the reason I was banning withdrawal
Toki0179 - J0SH Why did you ban withdrawal?
Ash777 - Sydney ya a free host should try its best
J0SH - Toki0179 I'd rather not answer this publicly
J0SH - Sydney I just don't though
Withdrawal - J0SH ok, answer it in DMs.
BaconHead - Nova I won't like to get cancelled, I just wanna say that the issue has been rectified. It's such an old issue that we should probably forget about it. There's no need to carry it on, it happened so it happened. Let's move on, no need to harrass them for so long about it
BaconHead - INfoUpgraders They have many other sources of income.
Nova - BaconHead your comparing this, to someone posting a tweet and getting canceled for it?
BaconHead - Nova I just realized, this was actually because quackhost didn't have a privacy policy. I didn't think it was something like that because I didn't check the whole thing but we can't keep dragging it on I mean come on dude he added a privacy policy a long time ago
Toki0179 - J0SH Dm me the answer then
grumpycat - Toki0179 they have stopped using the nulled argon thing (atleast i think) but i dont even think that anyone accepting their privacy policy is even of legal age and gets what he/she is agreeing  to
J0SH - That is not in our hands, If someone admits to being under 13 (discord tos and gdpr violations),
they're banned instantly, we can't keep track of every single user since theres way too many tickets already for the support team to handle.
J0SH - We stopped using the nulled argon before this thread was made, the comment "he removed it because it wasn't compatible with v1" is bullshit, I removed it because it was nulled.
Arctic - i think i should drop this here cuz it relates to qh

BaconHead - It was fun while it lasted guys, F for QuackHost. It got sold to centronodes
