Deleted User - I want to apologize be for being rude &amp; being a retard, hypocrite, moron, I am (Lightt/People in life), I am not @bad like some of you think I am. I am a kid, &amp; we all end up mistakes, such I manipulate people, &amp; this is just cringe, buttt.... yeah no, I don't want to talk about stuff, anyways I spend way too much time on screens for over 3 years (such as 6 hours daily on screens), as I grew, I realised what I was fucking doingg. I was just tryna get attentionn, prob cuz I love it. I have been exposed to a lot of shit on the internet &amp; have done a lot of shit on the internet, &amp; I am sorry for that, we all make mistakes, but can change from them.

Prudentia - eraters pognumbers, I wake up at 6 am have 2 hours, then I go to school until 3, then I have 6 hours, so basically 8 hours a day. And weekends are like 12 hours
Prudentia - FireShot You'll regret it, I've had the same mindset once of what the internet did to me, but I ended up regretting it real bad and lost a lot of my good friends.
