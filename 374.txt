Chirag - better-host more like worst-host.

when I joined, there was NO privacy policy, nor ToS, and I make a ticket asking for it, 

now they used a tos generator to generate one bruh


Then I asked them to make a real tos and not download one... But uh
They yoinked the tos from NewbieHost and pasted it without changing anything.


I told em it's copied, they deleted it, made a new channel called privacy policy and again yoinked NewbieHost's privacy policy...

edodark - Post with no sense because if you join the server there are tos and privacy policy bruh
Chirag - edodark ah yes, copied privacy policy, and tos which makes no sense ​https://everything.is-bannable.xyz/‌​᠎‌᠎​‍‍‌​᠎⁠‍‌᠎⁠᠎᠎​
Chirag - https://discord.gg/cd4tCwUuc3
discord link btw
DavidSaguna - Also to note, he is one of my staff members. (I'm DavidSaguna, the owner of NewbieHost)

I took 1 hour to write all that and then to make it a bit better or to upgrade it and you CTRL+C it in 10 seconds...

He will get demoted probably. He is also a velocitynode staff member.
DavidSaguna - Grammar is awful for the rules not generated by discord.


What is wrong... I mean yes, he made my server but not my tos or privacy policy. Now he edited the tos so I can't say anything... - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-04-16/1618549923-80613-image.png
