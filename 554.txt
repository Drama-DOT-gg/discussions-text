Ash777 - i thought privacy policy is to tell people how the company will handle their data and what procedure will  they follow in a data leak
Phantom_Fire7 - BRUH, they ping like 10 times a day
noplz - Well at leased the company's panel will be finished around this week.  I am having some crazy errors on this panel. Right now I am working on the VPS because it keeps refreshing everything right after I put up the panel.
AceGOD - Everyone i just want to say I'm sorry for everything ive done and all the mistakes i have done i will make sure they wont happen ever again.
AceGOD - AlphaDarky He meant that he isn't the owner of the bot but I have spoke to him and i don't think this will be happening again, I'm sorry that you had this experience with us.
AlphaDarky - mind explaining why im banned @AceGOD
AlphaDarky - is it because ur poor owner got roasted and i pointed it out or im helping with this drama.gg?
AceGOD - All the issues in this thread will be solved between today and tomorrow. Like i said I'm sorry for the way i acted towards you all and it will not happen ever again.
AceGOD - AlphaDarky I was mad but I'm sorry for doing that i will unban you right now.
AlphaDarky - unban me
AceGOD - AlphaDarky I will.
AceGOD - Beside fixing TOS and Privacy policy what else should I fix?
AceGOD - And I want to say thank you for doing this to show me what i have done wrong.
AlphaDarky - AceGOD domain better staff dont dm advert
Loadxwar - Does the owner even know how to run a host
AceGOD - Loadxwar No I didnt at the time but now i know everything abotu discord server.
HenryH - AceGOD That wasnt the question the he implied, it doesnt matter if you know how to "run" a discord server, again, No one is going to believe you for your claims, or forgive you for the things you did. As ProDev said, 

d e n i e d.
Yie - HenryH that's some fat denial message
