HarryW - I came across this host named PlexNode which appears to have no Terms of Service or Privacy Policy and they have a Freenom domain. Also they are possibly using a Kamatera Free Trial. There is no SSL on Dashactyl and they use their forums site as their main communication platform. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-09-21/1632262263-244587-image.png

Jamie_ - Guess who is getting support banned in the dashactyl discord server ðŸ¤”
Plexed - Hi
we are remake plexnode this week with non free trial node, ssl on dash, tos / privacy policy and new discord server

if theres anything else i need to add then say
rhys - Plexed  A actual domain. You need to add that
Plexed - rhys i spent all my money on contabo so i will buy domain when we earn at least a dollar for a xyz
Plexed - i understand its unprofessional but i spent all my money
rhys - Plexed I get that but your domain will just get redirected as soon as you open.
Plexed - Well i researched it and it should only happen  when the domain expires, by then we will have a proper domain
Plexed - If anything goes wrong then i take responsibility for not getting a lower spec contabo and getting a domain too
rhys - Plexed It doesn't work like that. 

They can redirect it at anytime.
Plexed - oh i dont think ill be affected so im not worried
Plexed - my service is extremely small right now
7442 - Plexed i'm gonna delete your domain lol

Plexed - Plexnode forums havent been used for a month now so i dont care
signyboi - Plexed pings @here like 10 times everyday.
signyboi - No privacy policy or tos. His excuse is "the host is the size of an ant" which it is not, it has 250+ members. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-10-01/1633081629-240262-image.png

Jacob - Plexed Then shut it down rather than leaving it unmoderated.
Plexed - Jacob no that would leave everyone with no hosting
signyboi - One of their nodes is a trial. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-10-01/1633083463-984470-image.png
signyboi - Plexed He is talking about the forums, you said they haven't been used in like a month so you don't care about them.
signyboi - For some reason they did a poll for this? - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-10-01/1633083796-568301-image.png
SnailDOS - signyboi I had a laugh.
signyboi - You can message in the welcome channel as well for some reason lol
Jacob - Plexed How so? It's just a forum.
rhys - signyboi ong
Plexed - signyboi its like that so people can welcome others xd
Plexed - signyboi well i didt know if people needed it or not
Plexed - signyboi hk1 is being moved to ca1 now
signyboi - Plexed You should know if you run a host. You also still haven't posted the IP.
Jacob - New site: plexnode.xyz
signyboi - Ah yes, great button placement on the PlexNode homepage. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-10-04/1633310151-144728-image.png
signyboi - They also don't have any filter whatsoever in the discord server, so if the staff are offline anything goes.
Deveroonie - HarryW There is no SSL

how are they even accepted into society LOL
Deveroonie - Jacob plexnode.xyz

great site - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-10-06/1633539953-652519-image.png
signyboi - Deveroonie They moved back to plexnode.cf I'm pretty sure.
Thominek - This host is same as Qloxhost only with different name it has the same owner as Qloxhost but with 2 more people being owners, the look professional from the outside not gonna lie but when u are in their discord server u will get constantly pinged like 1 hour 5 pings, their nodes might be trials but who knows they are keeping how they are paying the nodes secret and saying no VPN and any bad opinions on the host can get you banned like it they will see this post then they will ban me for sure

Their discord if anyone wants: https://discord.gg/qYKwZtVawD

Peace
Deveroonie - Best privacy policy - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-10-07/1633612716-71283-image.png
Thominek - basically how to describe this host: Another hosting that is owned by kids using free trials and banning people for no reason and for small stuffs dont even try to use those hosting they say they are best but actually they are something like badsk i bet that this host will barely pass 1 month of its existence
Plexed - Thominek sorry it already has existed for a month 
plex was opened on august 28th
GamerOmega - Plexed and its not like it says 26 of september on discord oauth2
Plexed - GamerOmega cause we switched discord auth app
rhys - This host is shit, using free trials. the owner of qloxhost runs it so clearly it's already gone wrong ðŸ’€
Thominek - Plexed okay but u responded only that what about that ur using free trials and muting innocent members that only wants support or migrate their server to an another node bc one of ur node is broken lmfao
Ptero - rhys damn u have to start lying now lmfao wdym i run plexnode u clearly havent taken a look ati t lol
Ptero - Thominek if u dont support ir liek the host leave its fucking server
Ptero - Ptero or like*
signyboi - In 5 days... - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-10-11/1633916375-772659-image.png
GoHill2 - signyboi No offence but why did you keep thumb up your own reply?
signyboi - GoHill2 I donâ€™t know tbh
rhys - Ptero im legit in the server dumbass, wdym i havent looked at it
Plexed - rhys well hes saying that you would have noticed that i run the server not him xd
rhys - Plexed he legit has the president role? bruh get some brain cells
rhys - rhys â€Œâ€Œ

iiChxrlly_ - QloxHost, PlexNodes &lt;--- Merge Them and change the nickname to like the badsk thread
Thominek - Ptero lmfao who would like your host? No one only maybe the 10 yrs old who are just trying to make an server and u mute them for asking questions if u wouldnt put Qloxhost dumbass owner in charge your host would be better and not on drama.gg

also this account Plexed is runned by Qloxhost dumbass owner not by other owners
Thominek - lmfao also giving random users 2000 coins is a bit retarded isnt it? Like yeah loosing a server on the node u got shutdown but like giving them 2000 coins is a bit too much
Plexed - rhys it doesnt mean he runs the host
Plexed - Thominek so your complaining about us being generous...
Plexed - oh god your all running out of things to complain about now
Plexed - Thominek xd perhaps all 1000 members? theres no one complaining
signyboi - Plexed Your pinging issue, You don't need to ping 60+ times in 5 days.
signyboi - Plexed No, your just giving out way too many coins.
Thominek - Plexed i can basically do anything since this is drama.gg ðŸ˜›
Thominek - Plexed giving people 2000 coins, i bet that your nodes will be like falixnodes that the server wont even start because ur shop is cheap and they can make an server with 10 cores easily lol
rhys - Plexed god you make me wanna curl up into a ball in a room alone and cry. 

why does he have president if he isn't ceo????? bruh explain istg ðŸ’€
rhys - Plexed no we're not actually, u still use free trials.
Thominek - they are using free trials lol
Thominek - thats why they have so many nodes they are using free trials because they are kids and cant pay for it
QloxHost - rhys yes fam im not the actual owner of it plexed is i just half merged with them
QloxHost - and at this point all of you are running out of complaints so you just start complaining about random shit lmfao
QloxHost - rhys and also none of you dont even have proof of any hosts using free trials cuz you just need random shit to complain about and thats what your doing to pretty much EVERY single host.
