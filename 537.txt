MysteriousK69 - Hello,

Thanks to @ArpanSen, I am here with yet another host.

So, let me start off with this, the owner of NixoNodes is underage, and he openly admits to that too.

They also have nulled WHMCS and themes.


Waiting on Arpan for proof of nulled theme.

After an IP lookup, he found out that their website is hosted on NameCheaps shared hosting.

Chirag - FatGrizzly the problem is, both license checkers are broken then-
Dannni - We use namecheap VPS for WHMCS, since WHMCS can't even run on shared hosting.
Proof for WHMCS. We have a legal Plus plan. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-28/1622197822-907231-image.png

Dannni - And in the UK, directors above 16 can run a company.
We pay over $120 for dedicated servers every month. There's no need to use nulled software.
