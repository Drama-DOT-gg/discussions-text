Iceey - Something unique doesn't always work, like what the fuck is a "Demon" Host? or CozeCloud? Where is the underlying meaning of the names...

Also, don't just pick a noun and add nodes/servers/VM to it. Fx BuyVM; Started very early, one of a few places where buying virtual servers was very accessible without bunch of KYC. (Please correct me if I'm wrong)

Thanks.
