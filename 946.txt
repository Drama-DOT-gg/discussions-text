HarryW - I have known about this hosting for a while and I know a few people who have bought from there and have had a terrible experience. First of all, The TOS or Privacy Policy button is broken on their site. Second of all the owner does not care about his staff members I have spoken to some of his other projects and they have all agreed they have been poorly treated by the PixelHosting CEO (blackwhitebear8). Avoid this host at all costs. Back in February, I caught them out for using Nulled WHMCS and only bought a license when I told them to.

If they're collecting data it's required by law in many states that they require a Privacy Policy, it also show's it's run by a bunch of kids who I wouldn't trust with my data anyways. They're also a bit stupid because if they have no Terms of Service they could be sued if Pixelhosting suspends or bans someone's account.
