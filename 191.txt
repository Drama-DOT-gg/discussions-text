Vanquish - This company called Ice Hosting is pretty sketch, it's run by BabyAces (they have DNDW)

for one, it's basically a FalixNodes copy cat.

Keypoints:

No Forced SSL on Client Area
Freenom Domain
bad site overall

BabyAces said some shit about logging into his client area like he's gonna pull my ip or something lmfao

Vanquish - BabyAces is also pretty slow in the head, kept firing at Hyperlion Hosting though they've never used it before and claiming your the "best host" if you sell i9 9900k VPS lmfao repeatedly showed the fact that our site isn't complete/fully customized yet after I said that it's still under construction 3 times.


also they sound like they're definitely under 13 - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-02-06/1612650679-729202-image.png
Tomas - He's about 14 and can't really spell, that's all
BabyAces - This thread should be completely deleted. This thread doesn't show anything.

I can't use a free domain? Is there a problem with it.

How is it a bad site?

And I didn't copy FalixNodes at all and they are a completely different company.


Those Shouldn't be there because here our uptime: 


Our support is very good, and there usually online. 

Wtf is even this? 
They don't even have a account with us. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-02-07/1612657206-420102-image.png

Vanquish - BabyAces for one, I'm not registering to your Client Area because you've already acted sketch about that. the uptime only shows the uptime of the ip address/network not the servers themselves. Your company is like falixnodes, not exactly them lmfao.

a bad site is defined by non-functioning buttons, non forced ssl etc etc.

the problem with the free domain is that you can afford a 70 euro server but not a 7$ yearly .com ?
Deleted User - Hello Vanquish,
     I am a Management Member over here Ice Hosting, I hear you had a bad experience with our website and/or services, now I hear you have an issue with our SSL, Let me clarify on this matter- We do not have an insecure platform which is why we did a transfer last night to a new Platform which provides more server security and less bugs. 
     
 Regarding our domain that is not a issue you should have "WinterHoax" us for as we have chosen our Domain- We have decided to keep it .gq until the V.2 Release due to the fact we have new nodes and new Partners(Leak), we use this domain because we have everything currently set to it and do not wish to change it at this time, We may see how you are not comfortable typing in `.gq` into your browser but that'll be changed in V.2.
 
Regarding your 'Bad Site' Claim I do not think that, that is something you can justify this WinterHoax for as it won't hold up, members in our server enjoy our website and even though we have downtime's so do a lot more hosting platforms I know, we are sorry for any inconveniences you have using our Website and we hope your future with us will be better.

Also regarding your claim of an "IP Pull"- The best we can do currently is suspend your Discord Account from our website so I am sure that's what my college meant. Also accusing someone of being 13? Really, I mean Discords ToS does also allow a 13 Year Old so I am not sure what you are getting at there.

If you have any more issues please feel free to reply to this as I will reply back!

Sincerely,
**`Rizer - Ice Host CEO`**
Vanquish - Rizer all replies invalid, once a winterhoax always a winterhoax.  BabyAces is known and holds the DNDW role.
Tomas - Rizer: Management member
also Rizer: ceo
Vanquish - Tomas LOL KEK
Deleted User - Add -On:
Might I also add you can not "accuse" someone for spelling/grammar mistakes? It's just him and I know him personally he means to spell something as something but I understand him so I'm sure you can get used to it.

Rizer - CEO Ice Hosting
Deleted User - Vanquish It may be invalid but I can prove your "accusations" to be incorrect.
Vanquish - Rizer colleague*
Vanquish - Rizer you haven't proved anything to be false nor incorrect, also you didn't have to reply in that format it just makes it harder to read
Deleted User - Pardon the selling error, So are you going to prove me to be incorrect or sit here and criticize my spelling?
Deleted User - Vanquish I just posted my reply above which elaborates on this whole situation.
Tomas - Rizer cretinzise*
Vanquish - Rizer No need, my original statement is staying strong.
Vanquish - Rizer "Pardon the selling error, So"
Deleted User - Vanquish Can you elaborate on how your original statement stands?
Deleted User - Tomas Nope- I spelled that correctly.
Vanquish - Rizer Yes, I can. Simply, your reply was invalid.
Deleted User - Vanquish "Invalid" elaborate on this please. As i'm pretty sure it was valid.
Vanquish - Rizer unable, re-read it yourself.
Deleted User - Vanquish Clearly you need to get facts straight then you can keep talking. Thanks :
Tomas - Rizer nowp, I spell d that correctelly
Vanquish - also, I forgot to mention nice TOS/Privacy Policy
Deleted User - Vanquish What is against the ToS/Privacy Policy?
EdwardSnowde - The fact that I almost got a DMCA claim because according to samm, he might of stolen the panel of MCHost.gg
BabyAces - We, have updated and fixed it.
Vanquish - Rizer it's shit
BabyAces - Edward that's completely wrong. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-02-07/1612661808-829320-image.png
Vanquish - VoGl another minion I see
BabyAces - @EdwardSnowde  So shut up now, because you don't now what your talking about.
HeldEnderMen - bruh you cant call something a falix node copy cat just because it's free hosting
Vanquish - BabyAces "shut up" so professional
Deleted User - Hello, I do not understand your claim, As I have proven it invalid with my previous paragraph(s) yet you feel the need to continue this matter? I am not sure what you are attempting to get/earn from this?

Thanks,
Rizer - CEO Ice Hosting
Tomas - HeldEnderMen did he announce that you have to storm this post?
BabyAces - I didn't.
EdwardSnowde - BabyAces  I said I almost got a DMCA claim, I didnt say I got one
Vanquish - Rizer HELLO MR CEO MAN, WE ARE NOT TRYING TO GET OR EARN ANYTHING FROM THIS. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING.

SINCERELY,
VANQUISH
HeldEnderMen - maybe if you had fax to back up your argument, I would somewhat believe but you provided nothing and just talk bad about a host, is childish and very lame
Vanquish - HeldEnderMen As I'm curious, did BabyAces make an announcement to flood this thread?
BabyAces - No I didn't.
Deleted User - Vanquish Clearly you need something- Clout? Clarity? Well this is not the place- With false claims you will get nowhere. Please contact me again when you feel like speaking facts and feel like telling the truth.

Thanks,
Rizer - CEO Ice Hosting
Vanquish - HeldEnderMen This platform is to share about hosts similar to Ice Hosting, we're not here to talk bad however we are here to spread the word about illegitimate hosts with malicious intents and such.
Deleted User - Vanquish Actually that was me- I figured why not give you a little clout. 

Thanks,
Rizer - CEO Ice Hosting
Tomas - HeldEnderMen fucking hell he really brought the whole circus, eh?
EdwardSnowde - Rizer he finna play you, check out what happend to SnowyHost and BombHost
Vanquish - Rizer No, we're not in this for clout. 

Thanks,
CEO of Linux
Vanquish
Deleted User - Vanquish You clearly have some ""malicious intents and such" with Ice That you have been proven wrong with and you insist on continuing.

Deleted User - EdwardSnowde Hello Edward,

I am completely aware of his past but Ice is a new host which means new start- We will not be judging anyone in this server.

Thanks,
Rizer - CEO Ice Hosting
Tomas - Rizer hey little guy, watch as he fucks you over
Deleted User - Vanquish You clearly need some teaching/professionalism in your life? Did something happen at home or are you going through puberty? Cause you certainly need attention to keep continuing.

Thanks,
Rizer - CEO Ice Hosting
Vanquish - BabyAces You are a child, you have no intention to run a professional hosting provider. You are stepping on unknown territory, I suggest doing something else with your life due to the fact that you clearly can't run a host for more than a week without shutting it down. You have called out other hosting providers which provide quality that is unmatched to the quality of Ice Hosting. You are not in any position to do so.
BabyAces - @vani
Deleted User - Tomas Well- Then I am stupid for falling in love with him, But for now. Im good &lt;3

Thanks,
Rizer - CEO Ice Hosting
EdwardSnowde - Rizer  Please take a look at what happened to BombHosting, he played the long game, and does the "debt and guilt" trick to get ownership and fuck shit up
Vanquish - Rizer This is not a professional place, thanks for indicating that you're the CEO of Ice Hosting on a reply.
Tomas - Rizer he's 14 you focking pedophile
BabyAces - @EdwardSnowde 

Actually no.  He is some one that actually provides something and he doesn't use me like you rus. You guys only used me for money and than when I shut my shit down you guys got pissed because you guys don't have any nodes.
Deleted User - Vanquish

BabyAces - Is there a problem with using my parents credit card if needed?
EdwardSnowde - BabyAces You said to me many times, that you use 100 percent of your own money,
eraters - Locked temporarily.
eraters - Resolved until the original post creator provides more evidence.
