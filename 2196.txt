Robert - Dear all,

It is with deep sadness that I must convey the heartbreaking news of the tragic passing of Sloth/Michael, the owner of Drama.gg and Exyq, this past Sunday. A friend of Michael, zomka, was notified by the Berlin police recently, confirming his death. My heartfelt sympathies go out to all who had the privilege of knowing him.

May he find eternal peace. ðŸ•Š

For those in disbelief (watch at your own discretion):
