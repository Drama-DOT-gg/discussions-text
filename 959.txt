After all, he keeps on mentioning the free wework beer,hes 16 so it would be illegal to give him beer, itâ€™s probably illegal for him to drink it there(before).


After all these, if he still doesn't get dndw, I can confirm drama.gg is a biased forum

NighMayHigh - Thank you for your concern into our business practices.

We pay a reseller for both whmcs and cPanel licensing, if you genuinely feel we null them, please report us to their abuse department, and we will be happy to comply with them.

regarding refunds, the only one outstanding is plactrix, which we are on the process of dealing with our bank to issue.

I will not be commenting further.

Hello,

 

Thank you for your response. 

 

There is not a valid cPanel &amp; WHM license active on this IP. This can be confirmed here -&gt; https://verify.cpanel.net/app/verify?ip=148.163.69.175 

 

If you have any questions or concerns or if I can be of further assistance please do let me know and I will be happy to assist.
M0N0W3LL - This was an alternate IP of the cPanel server, licensed to SkyNet, Sys413's reseller provider. Please see clip.

Also, the WHMCS license account was glitched. They do not reply to email, and do not confirm Sys413's consent and to prove license. Also their DMCA notification was, no permission, just "please remove the software from the server immediately". As a result, 413 will be legally obligated to stop using WHMCS, and will seek alternatives.



Finally, I don't know anything, about the refunds. I know for a fact that neither Andrew, nor I, currently manage any active payment accounts. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-09-10/1631297991-834272-capture-3.png
FatGrizzly - M0N0W3LL FatGrizzly has failed to consider that this was an alternate IP of the cPanel server, licensed to SkyNet, Sys413's reseller provider. Please see clip.

prove that is an alternate ip.
FatGrizzly - record yourself a video of loggin in with the same username at the "alternate" ip.

instead of laughing at someones post
Tomas - Pretty sure that proof is valid enough, it's just an additional IP
