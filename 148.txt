T-P Hosting is owned by CODER (CODER#0001) and Trojan.
CODER and Trojan are friends but what's weird about their host is that they were very competitive with other people and give less shit about their host and more about attacking other hosts.

I want to say a major thanks to a certain user by the name of Тiteiiko#5246. A majority of the evidence I am presenting is from Titeiiko and his expose video. He is very skilled at exposing and gathering information.

If interested in watching the expose video that he made then here is the link (I am not advertising, you are not required to watch. This is just to show where I got most of my evidence): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCgno15_FCY

If you want video footage of the raid then here is the link: https://youtu.be/tpIBcTtgAio

In addition, he raided someone else's server.



Attempted to take down someone's bot for the wrong reason and spammed the person's Gmail



For people wondering, his attempt failed because Emerald Mike's bot was OLDER


Coder/Trojan making up the dumbest shit ever

He was "contacted" by discord


Trojan leaked one's token and blamed it on someone else


CODER somehow forgetting about someone using Meowla to self-bot
He KNEW that someone was using the bot

Yet he somehow forgot about it - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-01-01/1609474970-430277-4.png
