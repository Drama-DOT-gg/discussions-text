EmeraldMike - yeah welcome to not giving a shit and way too much j4r
EestiMngur - Jamie_ we have thing called swap too

mtt - EestiMngur LMFAOO U DONE BRO?
EestiMngur - mtt bruh nodes arent using rn swap
mtt - EestiMngur mhm clearly
Koisip - Pretty funny I think - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-03/1622744582-413432-image.png
mtt - Koisip lmao both have owner perms, yet blackkitten can't do anything without CoolKitten/RihardKitten/Rihard yelling at him or controlling him. Pretty funny and immature i can say too
EmeraldMike - Koisip  Yes the funni
Koisip - Also, no "Miners are allowed."
Can u legit not spell 'minors.' - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-03/1622744788-83801-image.png
EestiMngur - Koisip cryptominers, dumbass
mtt - Koisip eh i think he means Miners as in CryptoMiners
mtt - EestiMngur damn someone woke up moody from his nap today
EestiMngur - ofc thats fucking cryptominer
mtt - EestiMngur calm down jamal, dont pull out the knife ðŸ™„
EestiMngur - mtt kills mtt
mtt - EestiMngur #scared #frightened #horror #scary
Koisip - So let me get this straight:

You legit own an absolute anarchy state.
Owner's servers get deleted by other owners. Owners harasses other owners. Your own member's servers get deleted and losing effort. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-03/1622745108-388149-image.png
EestiMngur - Koisip Yes, there was a confusion
Koisip - Koisip 
Can't tell what is worse.
a) Three brothers fighting over control of being king
or
b) This host
mtt - EestiMngur that should not even happen...
mtt - this happens when u dont know how to manage a host and have retarded staff/owners who don't know what they're doing
EestiMngur - Someone did something on settings.json on our dash
EestiMngur - mtt logging system is now on
mtt - EestiMngur yeah exactly, you cant even protect ur dashboard from ppl entering it
Koisip - EestiMngur It's best advise to either:
a) Work on major staff reform because staff team can either: 
Slack
Benefit themselves more than others
 
 b) Have just one owner. Having multiple just results in some sort of privilege crisis and now u get owners doing stuff that can harm other owner's process.
EestiMngur - @mtt#1808 i totally didnt log emerald ip
mtt - EestiMngur congrats!!
you made yourself look worse.
BREAKING UR OWN PRIVACY POLICY LMFAO

also congrats on learning how nginx or dashactyl logs work
EestiMngur - mtt He didnt help me
Koisip - EestiMngur "useful staff"

100% not making resources for himself to benefit himself more than helping you
mtt - EestiMngur you are breaking your own privacy policy by leaking his ip or doxxing him. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-03/1622746108-197264-image.png
mtt - you didnt even read ur own generated policy. smh

EestiMngur

mtt - luca Site
Discord
EstCraft - Where tf i doxxed him?
EstCraft - I wanna see proofs
EmeraldMike - okay bet
EmeraldMike -  - https://cat.emera.cat/md5UDA0.png
BaconHead - luffyy it does say in the rules dogs aren't allowed
mtt - BaconHead thats the most immature behavior ive ever seen a host act like. yall aint animals ffs
BaconHead - mtt I don't make the rules, rihard does
mtt - BaconHead never said u did
BaconHead - EmeraldMike dude to apply for staff you have to make a ticket, you didn't "just get it"
BaconHead - EmeraldMike He didn't leak it though. Also, you should expect a website to log your IP.
mtt - BaconHead he went out of his way to collect his information (IP Address). 
Even if he didn't leak it, he still broke the Privacy Agreement that he generated for his host.
The information should not be collected for any other purposes than login, registration or actions within the host's website and if it was collected it was used in a way to blackmail or pick the ip up from third parties.
EstCraft - I told black to update privacy policy as i dont fucking have access to it
mtt - EstCraft well thats what you get for not even reading or caring abt ur own ""legal docs""
EstCraft - mtt Ima upload them to kh domain when i get code from black
mtt - EstCraft oh yeah theyâ€™re not even hosted in ur own domain ðŸ’€
EmeraldMike - BaconHead  Yeah okay so how can you explain how I got staff and never submitted a application.
EmeraldMike - Also EstCraft  by you enabling IP logging you are breaking the law
Koisip - BaconHead the host has serious staff issues and ownership privilege crisis

Literally it's easy to manipulate one of the owners to give free resources.
EmeraldMike - Koisip  Also CoolKitten aka Rihard has nuked hosts before
dxomgmyfriend - RIP host
Jamie_ - EestiMngur you just said to me they were
Jamie_ - As a dashactyl dev, I can promise that in V1, we will make it so we can block shitty free hosts from using it.
mtt - Jamie_ please do-
Koisip - Jamie_ god officially steps in
EmeraldMike - Jamie_  yes please.
BaconHead - EmeraldMike well idk then
BaconHead - EmeraldMike I mean we could have solved all these issues internally. But you just didn't care about the host despite the fact you were a staff member.
BaconHead - EmeraldMike man soon you're gonna say breathing is cringe
EmeraldMike - BaconHead No otherwise everyone would be cringe lol.
EmeraldMike - BaconHead ah yes not like I have pointed out all the things stated here to staff and got 0 feedback.
BaconHead - EmeraldMike What I wanted to say was, how were we being cringe?
BaconHead - EmeraldMike I couldn't see in staff chat
BaconHead - Also how did this bug appear out of nowhere? The owners probably didn't do something like that because why would you allow it in your own host
BaconHead - BaconHead Before I wasn't able to allocate more resources to my server so someone has modified it (I ruled out the owners) and there are 3 other people that had access (including emerald also I'm not saying you did it as long as there is no proof I'm just saying)
EmeraldMike - BaconHead  it wasn't a bug
EmeraldMike - They covered up the mistake as a bug.
BaconHead - EmeraldMike Yeah but before I couldn't allocate more resources than I had to a server so someone may have meddled with it
BaconHead - BaconHead Also someone was messing with APIs. CoolKitten wouldn't do that, Blackkitten said he didn't, and mythical didn't have access. The only people that had spa were 2 people.
EmeraldMike - BaconHead  someone *unknown who&gt; modified the default reasources settings and the node allocations. Causing these seemingly huge servers to appear. When the found out KNOWING IT WAS A MODIFICATION. Proceeded to label this as a bug and deleting servers that where more than the original default values.
EmeraldMike - BaconHead  API is generic but yes I was aware.
BaconHead - EmeraldMike okay, so that means one of 2 people with spa messed with it
EmeraldMike - BaconHead  more than 2 people had SPA. As far as ik. Originally Mythical, Black, Antonio,TME and cool had SPA. Too many people if you ask me.
BaconHead - EmeraldMike I ruled out the owners (why would they do such a thing?) plus mythical got his spa taken away or something when the apis were messed with, antonio recently got spa, so that just leaves you two
EmeraldMike - BaconHead  well there are like 3 owners or something
BaconHead - EmeraldMike Yeah, but again mythical didn't have spa due to some reason. Again, why would black/rihard do such a thing? black even confirmed it was not him. Just you and TME are left.
EmeraldMike - BaconHead  TME owns cat services aka a direct competitor to kitten host
EmeraldMike - Sooooooo
EmeraldMike - EmeraldMike  Side note cat services is also on drama.gg lol.
BaconHead - EmeraldMike It's possible, but you both look sus. Nevertheless, we can't make baseless accusations without digging deeper.
EstCraft - EmeraldMike every free  host is on drama.gg
mtt - EstCraft false
RobusOfficial - EmeraldMike i as one of the staff can agree at the J4R, most of us (including me) doesnt even have Staff LVL 4 (which is the LVL required to have SPA), so we ended pinging executive or any higher up and ended up having worst user experience
BaconHead - RobusOfficial That's because the owners didn't trust us enough yet
BaconHead - EmeraldMike You could have sent an email to mail@kittenhost.xyz and I didn't even see you telling the owners all these things
EstCraft - BaconHead WE DONT HAVE EMAILS, DONT SPREAD FAKE INFO
BaconHead - EstCraft look at tos it says we have that in contact us - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-04/1622797421-450840-00b0889f-f07b-445c-a5e6-80e45b61915e.jpg
EestiMngur - wait what where did this come but i will create email
and update legal docs soon
Koisip - BaconHead 
3 owners
privilege crisis
BaconHead - Koisip Coolkitten said he needs to test me first it has nothing to do with the three owners
EestiMngur - Koisip now 2 owners
EestiMngur - https://privacy.kittenhost.xyz/
EestiMngur -  - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-04/1622825525-649144-capture.png
EmeraldMike - EstCraft  false
EmeraldMike - EstCraft  LOL
EmeraldMike - EestiMngur  yeah those shitty gened ones
EmeraldMike - EestiMngur  No where does it say IP so your breaking your own TOS
EmeraldMike - EmeraldMike *PP
EmeraldMike - Wait nvm but this was put AFTER THE FACT
EestiMngur - EmeraldMike so now we are allowed to log IPs
EestiMngur - if you cant read then ðŸ˜› you have no brain
EmeraldMike - EestiMngur  well i mean yes and no. However i would stop using the host that you collect IPs and don't even say what you use it for YIKES!
EmeraldMike - And i guess this is a LEGITIMATE BUSINESS INTEREST - https://cat.emera.cat/md5UDA0.png
Koisip - The fact that black is still an owner still just proves the idea that having more than one owner results in privilege problems.
Watch this, black is gonna do a lot of shit w/o CoolKitten's awareness and a lot of people are gonna lose their hosting.

@EestiMngur You legit have to re-structure the ownership-structure of your server because if you continue to have more than one owner then your going to deal a lot of issues similar to this and owners are going to falsely represent your server and cause more drama. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-04/1622828055-505830-image.png
Koisip - Koisip Or atleast make him Co-Owner / Manager.
Koisip - Nvm, he fucking left. Couldn't handle the cringe lol gg - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-04/1622828380-213350-image.png
BlackCat - Koisip yeah i cant handle the cringe staff
BlackCat - i got like 643864368 pings per nanosecond because i was only one who did know how to add resources (only one with spa) 

cringe staff list:

baconpig (baconhead)

eh kinda nothing else but baconpig is a full retarded staff he thinks that i can do everything he does ask like:

"code a bot that shows your servers" smth like that

""
EestiMngur - now im the only owner
EestiMngur - BlackCat lets add you to cringe staff list too
BlackCat - yeah ur cringe cus u dont understand dashactyl logic
BaconHead - BlackCat How the hell am I cringe?? And tf dude I don't have spa you gave SPA TO THE WRONG PERSON aka emerald and when the heck did I ask you to code a bot?? Rihard doesn't add resources, TME is inactive, so who the hell do you expect me to approach?? You say that you will "demote me if I ping you again" YEAH BUT WHAT DO I DO? GIVE OUR CUSTOMERS WORSE RESPONSE TIME AND UNDERMINE OUR REPUTATION EVEN MORE??
Koisip - BaconHead How the hell am I cringe??
"If you spend more time being apart of an argument in which you have very little context about than spending time taking a step back and looking at the true story of the scenario, then your doing something wrong."
EmeraldMike - BaconHead  and you have what past experience with pterodactyl and servers.
eraters - EmeraldMike Kittens are cute

dogs are superior
EestiMngur - eraters dogs are shit 
and shit is your mom
EestiMngur - BlackCat u wanna ban-bonk too?
RTKDMme - I don't like cats
RobusOfficial - EmeraldMike tbh, i know about the rihard situation but didnt even knew that he changed his name to coolkitten
RobusOfficial - BaconHead maybe scroll up a little bit?
FlatIcon - I think that everyone could agree:
"you get what you pay for". (I mean that you couldn't find quality on a free host)
EestiMngur - Jamie_ ok bruh im alr planning to get other panel meow meow
RobusOfficial - BaconHead yeah ik
BlackCat - nice owner check - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-05/1622879228-337398-image.png

BlackCat - btw my servers got suspended for no reason - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-05/1622879335-483634-image.png
BlackCat - lmao hes asking me 69$ to get my servers unsuspended what
EestiMngur - BlackCat u have leaked everything, your acc is now terminated
BaconHead - EmeraldMike I have used it before and even if I didn't know I'd figure it out. When I said "wrong person" I meant that you didn't solve all of this internally or even hint out most of these problems to the owners. I didn't even say "you could've given it to me"
EmeraldMike - BaconHead  Bruh I have out right pointed out these issues many times
EmeraldMike - FlatIcon  True True.
EmeraldMike - EmeraldMike  and it's not my fault that the issues where ignored
EmeraldMike - eraters  No one asked and false
BlackCat - Btw the owner is raider. He raided @EmeraldMike host and tried to raid mattt host but he failed lmao
BlackCat - raid was like few months ago but stll
EestiMngur - BlackCat https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/841332253573120052/850723642623262720/Screenshot_20210605-081159_Discord.jpg wanna explain? we are doing our best to not let you to take down our host
mtt - this wouldâ€™ve never happened if you werent such a bitch lmao, just quit already
Mitchell - BlackKitten: i wanna help in your host
Owners: yes
Owners: let's kick blackkitten he being nub
BlackKitten: backstabs
EmeraldMike - Mitchell accurate
Koisip - EestiMngur 
bro what's wrong? You raid other servers, it's only right to raid yours.
EmeraldMike - Also here is a older post that explains the raiding and stuff in more detail https://drama.gg/d/215-skycastle-hosting/22
BlackCat - this is what they do with your ip btw - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-06/1622956263-22980-image.png
BlackCat - (he spammed it 100x in gc)
EestiMngur - proof that i got it from kittenhost?
EestiMngur - you leaked mine too
BlackCat - EestiMngur 
You need to prove that you didn't log ips and collect them, otherwise all of arguments that  the ip is from somewhere else are invalidated as it can't be proven that you aren't simply lying so you aren't proven as abusing logs
BlackCat - EestiMngur doesnt matter still u leaked ips
EestiMngur - stfu dog, you sent me your ip - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-06/1622956771-756536-sfsfsf.png
Koisip - So let me get this straight:

This guy "CoolKitten" raided servers and got fucked by other people for being a dick and now he is the good guy of the story. So he went little kid angry and now threatening with a private ip address to people just because CoolKitten can't properly sustain a host and friendship, cringe.
mtt - spent sad minutes of his life for him and his sad friendo to try hurting my feelings which didnt even work

BlackCat - so friendly yes - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-06/1622979068-632276-image.png
EestiMngur - BlackCat yes
EestiMngur - also, thats off topic
