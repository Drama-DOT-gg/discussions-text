MrMysterious - Hi, I'm a friend of Olli's he asked me to post this.

Disclaimer - "I am not in any way saying that Sydney supports pedophiles, or should be harassed. All I am saying is that she should learn to acknowledge the fact that reading context is important as she has made herself look terrible!" - Olli Wesselingh








"They banned me from their discord for getting frustrated after being told to "calm it down" for telling a pedophile that he deserves to rot in hell. When I asked why, they stated that me telling a literal child predator to rot in hell was breaking rule 3 :skull:. Absolutely disgusting staff and community. I always knew drama.gg was a shitty community, but this is low even for them. It honestly sickens me. I'm not accusing Sydney of supporting pedophiles, I am however saying that she needs to read the context before jumping to conclusions as this has made herself look bad, and has shown me that there is a lack of moderation on the website protecting it's users from potential pedophiles. If this thread gets taken down I'll be severely pissed off as I didn't post it and have clearly stated that I'm not calling Sydney a pedophile supporter." - Olli Wesselingh - https://imghost.413.io/ib/lIHT4FVlQ2.png

Sydney - Renamed the thread for ya
aruki - Content Removed
Sydney - aruki Unrelated to thread.
Robert - aruki Mate

Making a boatload of threads about [insert host here] using gcp/aws/azure/etc is not really considered good, original drama, no? Or am I going crazy? If something's that repetitive, is it still considered enjoyable, or is it straight up repetitive nonsense? A lot of stuff here is fairly "unmoderated", but we don't want people to for instance do illegal stuff since that's too unmoderated.


Anyway, back to this thread's original topic
Young - MrMysterious 
I love how the main topic of the argument went from pedophiles to saying slang words

And it ends with Sydney drop kicking toki's ass lol
