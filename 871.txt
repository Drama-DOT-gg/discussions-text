Jerome - Let's turn the tables, Colour Nodes CloudLinux is expired about a year now and they still claim they have CloudLinux at their website.

This is the result when I lookup on cPanel website.

FatGrizzly - bruh
FatGrizzly - do you actually fking think that CloudLinux can only be bought on cpanel.net?
FatGrizzly - I just feel like you are goddamn stupid.
A reverse dns lookup reveals that the server hostname is charlie.cloudns.io and they literally have BitNinja.io in their servers, and how on earth do you think that such a big company will use a nulled license fool.


they have a license tho.

FatGrizzly - Jerome CLN doesn't show license history.
Tomas - It's most likely not even their server? Cloudlinux doesn't always have to be bought via cPanel
Jamie_ - Tomas Thank you.
Jamie_ - Let me ask Jerome, do you have anything better to do other than try and make my company look bad for things that aren't true?
