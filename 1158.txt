Ibrahim - so today my friend showed me a host called Spooky nodes and I checked and they literally don't have a privacy policy or terms of service at all.
if you check their information tab this is all you can see 

another thing is that the owner doesn't even know how to setup the Panel and Client Page, MIke or shershah did it for him.

taking a look at their paid plans pricing it is absolutely terrible. 

a look at their only node which is in Germany, I can see their using Hetzner. 

the thing with Hetzner is people often abuse it because with Hetzner you pay at the end, and sometimes people use it to their advantage which is kind of suspicious in my opinion.

and about their owner, im sorry i just had to point this out look at their profile. 
i mean it should sum it up just like that

another bad quality of this host is they will literally just make anyone staff if they ask for it ðŸ˜‚ - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-10-30/1635602907-886086-7fee6e94-df4c-4612-91f5-d634cfd32d4d.jpg
