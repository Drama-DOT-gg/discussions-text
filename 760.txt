FlatIcon - A little poem for our loved hosts:
For "don't hate me guys" reasons that's not something serious, just a little pamphlet, just to put a smile on your face, also again, if there would be some grammar mistakes would be just because i cannot find a correct rhyme.

Maybe you need some hosts
They're scammy or not
And sometimes is tricky to choose what you're at
So if you're wondering what host will drive you crazy
It is easy to know because, every host will
A is for atlas hosting, source of cheap servers
Overselling and other new problems
B is from Badsk, that might be okay
But nobody know, what host is his main
C is for Contabo, the loved and cheap one
Bribes you for an angry review
D is for Drama, we know what is it
If you're angry now, you're a part of it
E is for Emulated, the host with this name
Banning you for being a little bit ill
F is for Falix, the famous free hosting
We all know that they're overselling RAM memory
G is for GoDaddy, it is not (yet) on Drama
But if you are smart, you will know that it will
H is for Hetzner, suspending your server
If you get attacked, by a ddos kid
I is for iHostArt, owned by a liar
he says he's eighten, he's another kid
J is for Jen, another bad guy
He brings a free stresser that will lead to your doom
K is for Kali, hackers know that
It's just a Linux distro, made for those kids
L Lostlatitude, it looks like a host
But from what i know, they love playing with bots
M is for MjCloud, owned by minors
And they get so scared, when they look into mirrors
N is for NeroNodes, they have bad hardware
And well if you focus, you hack their software
O is for omninodes, they don't pay their servers
And also you don't know when they sell themselves
P is for problema, in my language means problem
Another free host on a free domain
R is for ReeLee, he want free domains
Tried to steal from a honest reseller
S is for ServerTop, they won't refund you
Even if nothing will work on your order
T is for Terms, that is not a host
But something required to be a good one
U is for USA, that is just a country
Because of these scammers, it is losing money
V is for ViaHost, another famous one
If you look on pinned, you will find them as a thread
W is for WHMCS, they're also bad
As they're increasing prices with hundreds
Just saying that forced more hosts to be nulled
And other ones didn't survived
X is for XenonHost, they aren't a drama thread
But if you look closer, their company is fake
For Y surprisingly i can't find a host
But if you start selling, you can be this one
Z is for Zap-Hosting, a german provider
Threatening with debt collectors and also the law
You can't avoid bad hosts, just go on and try
No matter your actions, you still gonna fail.

How was it? 
If i would get some positive feedback i could continue it.

(btw, let me know if there's something wrong with it)
