Puggo - Welp, delete the old thread because I forgot the password to my other account, again. I will be making this my main account. 

So pretty much Vanquish#9072 wanted me to post a picture on drama.gg showing a picture with badsk's and nyan's chat. He added a cursor thinking it would make badsk think I token logged nyan.

Puggo - (administrators of drama.gg can remove the old thread.)
https://drama.gg/d/543-i-dont-token-log-they-are-lying
Tomas - ok and
bad - oh well looks like he has nothing left to say - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-22/1621712531-26174-image.png
Puggo - bad Idk bout Nyan he just provided vanquish with the screenshots then vanquish edited them and tried to say I framed nyan.
Puggo - and also @bad  how come you still have shocknodes.net in your status on drama.gg?
Puggo - and  Vanquish also ddos'ed me once, he started acting like he did not even know.  My internet went off completely out of random so I tried connecting back and It did not work. I and my friend told vanquish to screen share, he had an SSH software and CMD open and Nord VPN open. Me and my friend told him to open the CMD application and it showed my IP was pinging. The start of the ping was timed out he most likely ddos'ed me at the  time.
Vanquish - You can't necessarily prove anything within the screenshots provided, messages sent on discord can be edited regardless of the platform, app, mobile or browser.

Within the screenshots, you show the use of a prohibited better discord plugin "message logger", I advise you to remove these for one they hold no evidence value within the thread, and two you're risking yourself being terminated from discord itself.

You are currently disobeying the acts of the administrators of this forum by changing the title back to contain the name of a hosting provider that does not have any connection or relations to the core point of the thread after the title was changed to remove the host from the name.

Vanquish - Puggo I doubt you have any evidence to back this up as usual.

You use them yourself, whenever I deleted a message you used to screenshot it and send it back.

I am just trying to show the GameSped community what you actually are like.

its funny how you deleted the messages after I posted the thread AND its funny how all the messages add up that are apparently "editied"
RealOreo - Lol
Tomas - You use BetterDiscord and a message logger
Puggo - Tomas So does Vanquish.
Vanquish - Puggo How can you prove that?
RealOreo - Either way, logged messages isnâ€™t evidence.
Vanquish - unrelated, but really quite the nuisance he is. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-22/1621713629-698705-image.png
