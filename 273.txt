Daftscientist - Hello, daft here, i don't usually get myself too involved in winterhoax, but this host has made me MAD, lemme tell you guys what happened so we all know System413.io partnered with RolledHost, and we know the issue there. But what I found out after was that Leo had gone onto the RolledHost GamePanel and stolen the Client Area, I know I got demoted from rolled during all this (honestly i have no idea why), but I coded more then half the client area and the rest of the RolledHost team coded the coin earning, so this is why I'm mad, there are some other points I would like to address There nodes are really over allocated and a few other things I'm sure my friends will cover lower down in this thread, below are some screenshots with captions.

Client Area:
https://img.daftscientist.com/FMNZFnOTo1Q - villagenodes haveing the same client area login page as rolledhost has.
https://img.daftscientist.com/BFx8EQBl5g0 - villagenodes haveing the same dashboard page as rolledhost has.
https://img.daftscientist.com/iMgEP-UcpJA -  villagenodes haveing the same earn coins page as rolledhost has.
This carries on for every single page.

Overalocation

Feel free to add.
FranXis - Yeah, VillageNodes is a hosting that is own by Leo, the person who want kill some hosting like rolledhost
They overlocate nodes and uses the same things that other hostings, he forgot to change DMCA badge!!
candy - Overallocate is in every hosting, Even in rolled 3500% overallocating. If the usage is low, overallocation is fine.
About the client panel, we'll change it in few days.
FranXis - candy Rolled isnt overlocating nothing, so you cant say that, and you cant use the client so u need change rn
candy - Nah, I'm Leo. and I know Rolled had over 400GB RAM on one node.
Daftscientist - You did steal rolled client panel what do you have to say bout that...
candy - Daftscientist Yes, I did since they changed it. But i will fix that right now.
candy - Fixed.

TheOfficialAce - May this thread be closed? Cause I have bought Cubemc and rebranding it. - Thank you winterhoax staff members.
Iceey - TheOfficialAce I like how you think that'll get it closed
Tomas - Until everything mentioned on this thread gets 'fixed', it will not be closed.
Chirag - TheOfficialAce did you buy the discord server?
TheOfficialAce - Yes, I bought everything. I have been re-doing it and everything should be fixed.
Chirag - TheOfficialAce https://discord.com/guidelines
As far as I remember, selling/buying servers or accounts breaks discord guidelines #15, ok time to report
eraters - Technically not ToS as the discord was a side-asset sold WITH the company, and not individually. It's against to directly buy it, but that did not happen in this situation.
TheOfficialAce - @Chirag , We do not  steal or abuse after I joined the ownership team. (I'm the main owner) (They are working on a new host called duehost. ))

TheOfficialAce - @Tomas May you close this thread please?
eraters - No. ToS &amp; privacy policy dont work.
candy - TheOfficialAce As he said, Yes. I started working on different project and made him the main project leader for CubeMC.
candy - TheOfficialAce DuoHost**
candy - Tomas This thread started with dashactyl theme issues.
Which is now fixed Daftscientist 

Also, luffy we stopped using the Dashactyl theme long time ago.

Also he didn't purchase the discord, I made him the project leader because I was busy, and have no time to maintain free hosting company.
