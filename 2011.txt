inspiration_Creation - Good Evening Gentlemen, My name is Inspiration. I am here today to talk/explain HassleVPS that went viral on the community with a scam.. I was there in the first day, one of the few people who were invited. I saw the server and... i found out it was total bullshit since on thier channel called "infrastructure"(they deleted it due to knowing the risk of bieng exposed), i saw that the images they putted which they claimed to be thiers, was off google. I cant find the screenshort but i am sure many of u saw it and thought abt it. When i found out about it, i started to dig in for more proof depending on them bieng scam or legit. I first saw thier "proof" channel. It IS completely empty:

I alr knew it was a scam but i dug in even more to found out that the members who actually paid to get vps were just bieng told to wait: 
 
 
 They even asked for 3 euros (like seriously any one can afford that amount) for "vps": 

they keep on making special deals like : 

they keep on promoting without giving anything: 


And they keep on asking for Members to be patient : 

This is my proof of them bieng total bullshit! If u Have any other evidence that will benifit this case. Send it to my discord : @Inspiration#0001 - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-08-19/1660899898-293614-image.png

SnowAnarka - u want wait ;-;
Alexutz1337 - Hello, as an Director of Hassle Team i would like to say that we are not a scam, and we didn't launch yet. And WhiteDream assumed that the photo on infrastructure channel that was deleted, was from google! And that is why he deleted it. I hope you understood.
Robert - Alexutz1337 And how exactly do you want to offer a VPS with 32 vCores and 84GB RAM (oddly specific amount, but sure) for €5,99 without losing profit or anything? This does not seem profitable at all, and just seems like a gigantic red flag. Next to that, your guy is begging for €3 and yet can afford those VPS nodes?
htdocz - If anything is free, you are the product.
awsamboi - 5.99 eur for 32vcores,84gb ram, 4.25tb ssd lmao, lmk once theres profit, unless the servers are from hetzner or gc for free lol
NaziKat -  - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-08-19/1660906785-79946-screenshot-20220711-212824.jpg
inspiration_Creation - Alexutz1337 i understand, but as i have seen there is no proof of ur purchasements or anything, all u have been saying from yesterday is "BUY THIS PLAN OR BUY THAT PLAN", it isint fair is it? there was this member who was gonna give 8 boosts for vps, were u really not gonna give em it? and why am i banned?
inspiration_Creation - NaziKat boi, what the fuck... bruh does he even have any knowledge on this shit
NaziKat - inspiration_Creation fr
WhiteDreamDev - NaziKat Unfortunately, this was 3 months before I made HassleVPS, I was just joking with RadyX, Do you think I don't remember anymore?, Plus you will create vps from me then
WhiteDreamDev - Robert 
I would like to tell you that we own our own servers
WhiteDreamDev - Robert Bro , i Hassle Own Private Servers , ok?
TheAlex - Wait real talk, how can you give 32 scores and 84 gb ram for 6 euros? (Counting tax, you get 4 euros). This is literally not possible (if you want to turn up a profit)
TheAlex - WhiteDreamDev them why was the image posted in the proofs channel from Google?
P4RADOX - WhiteDreamDev no you dont lmfao
DevXo - He even tried to purchase a VPS from me, but it was suspicious. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-09-01/1662018917-157990-screenshot-20220901-105319.png
ffuqer - HassleCloud is a total scam... Me and my friend (ukcai) nuked hassle and promoted our host (well im demoted now but thats not important) just to tell people that hassle is a scam and he said that hassle lost members which is very good and its 100% a scam since they said ukcai is a griefer??? Like what atleast say why he said you are scamming, no you didnt even mention scamming or what we sent... So yeah like if they said "we arent scam" it would be a bit better but no you didnt even mention scamming you just said hes a griefer... So yeah
GeoHasCameBack - ffuqer good.
WhiteDreamDev - =)
WhiteDreamDev - Good lyer
