LucaDev - Hey, Luca here.
I'm not really a big fan of all this drama.gg stuff but this thread isn't to expose AquaticNodes (since they basically already expose themselves publically lmao) but to raise awareness of this shit host.
They've got nearly 1K members on their discord so I'd say they're not that irrelevant as they should be.

Let's start with the administration (the pictures speak for themselves):

Pretty "nice" response to a review lmao


what a comeback


also arguing with me while their panel is down kek


every single one of them who responded is an owner btw


Pretty mature announcements I'd say.


I was hoping this was a joke.


https://aquaticnodes.host - their website

Eh, that's all from me.

Jen - LucaDev I'm going to offer the owner of AQNodes some money cause I do know this person actually somehow way before I knew he owned this brand. And I'll see if I can get ownership of it, If I do I'll fix it.
Parzial - Jen Is it worth it?
GOOGLYGo - Hey kindly hr

LucaDev hey buddy,

Help me in https://drama.gg/d/1978-aquaticnode-abuses-trial-no-tos-unprofessional-breaking-discord-tos/

So we can make people know the truth about the host 

I'm waiting

Thank you
GOOGLYGo - Jen gl let me remind you it's not a brand until he gets a proper government documents and approval which takes around $200-$1k and lastly being owner shouldn't be that hard as there are already 10+ owners hahaha
Jen - GOOGLYGo lol. For suree

XxMBGxX - ewn invoice and proof you dont abuse üëçÔ∏è
ewn - XxMBGxX ask my friend for the invoice and not me.
GOOGLYGo - ewn 

that's not the question, and that doesn't proves anything, don't act like 13 year old stupid kid, oh wait you are 13 yr old, my Badd.

Wow you brought a new vps by abusing trial again' , why weren't you satisfied after I reported you on Amazon for abusing it maybe you need more than suspend account ig.

I thought you would learn something after your account got suspended but still u will be a stupid kid.

Aaa we are moving from the topic, let's just show us the receipt of your invoices from azure with your invoice I'd and comapny I'd that you have brought it.

And aren't using trials again' from new account.

Let's just continue on 1 thread
