MysteriousK69 - Good morning minasan,

Today, I am talking about a kid in my server, who just came in and tried to sell us reviews, and while at it, he also admitted to raiding PAQUET host (my apologizes if I got the name from).

Starting off with him selling us reviews,
Let me give you some context first. So, he left a 3 star review because our servers are laggy as we don't give a ton of CPU on the free plan (which was the case quite a while ago, but we give a ton more than that now), nothing wrong with that, and I respect his review.

What I don't respect is him going into general, asking for the resources he got for inviting 20 people even after 7 of them left and never joined back. Everytime we asking him for the resources, he said "X stars", X always being lower than his previous review. If this doesn't make it isn't awfully obvious that he was trying to sell us reviews, I don't know what will.
Checking his invites:

Aypro offered the resources back if he gave proof of everyone joining back, but he tackled it with "sMh 2 STarS nOW".


Decreasing the review score even further after I denied to give resources

Bad support because we aren't giving you resources for literally nothing? Very cool!


As for raiding servers, here he admitted to it.
