Abooz - They say 1 day and 21 hours till expiry then the server proceeds to get wiped by them 21 hours before expiry.
They did not even keep the due invoice.


Also did i mention that they usually respond to a ticket every 6 hours but when you mention "lawsuit" they respond in 2 minutes? - https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/762413706814291981/806205678280114206/unknown.png

AlexPads - This has always been the case with OneProvider however they are globally recognized. They do have some issues that they need to figure out but honestly make things a lot easier by providing a place to get multiple servers at the same time. I used them for a short while but eventually left due to 6+hr response times and them always blaming it on "waiting for the other provider to respond" but I eventually just started using the direct provider and can always get responses in minutes. I think they have grown over what they can properly support and they need to re-look at their company. This being said what they did was wrong but most likely not their fault being that all of their servers are resold. Most likely the reseller did something wrong.
