Sloth - Who is AYS?

Yes, he is the owner of the MCHost, node.gq etc. The host that used the FalixNodes system.

Should we talk about him abusing in FalixNodes? Adding random STAFF and trying to destroy that host...? Naah...
That's nothing. Or, hmmm... (Also he removed my partner rank without Lamaker's permission.)

He muted a guy with the reason for using an old nick that he had.



He still muted him, even if LAMAKER removed he warns.

AYS - I am Mattgq and I owned mchost, me punishing someone in falixnodes doesnt make sense, why are you even putting it here? Mchost or nodegq never did anything illegal, I paid for nodes, vps, etc. Rawsrv whmcs isnt nulled its just a problem with whmcs, I can update this in 4-6 hours when I get home
deleted - AYS Rawsrv whmcs isnt nulled it

yeh webud not have nulled whmcs it was just an error  with whmcs yesyes
Jpaul - Bruh this is fact nice one mitu!
Jen - @AYS Yet your the most Bias Admin here.
AYS - This thread should be closed, how I punish people in falixnodes isnt anything related and should not matter, I am Mattgq but mchost wasnt illegal also if you ask Lamaker I had permission to use their source for one month. In a group where andrex, mituishere, dazoid and exoticalcat are I showed proof of owning whmcs licence, after giving reissued code to dazoid it still didnt work, I will try reinstalling whmcs tonight. Thanks.
Pamar - AYS I am confirming about he had permission to use FalixNodes's code
Deleted User - Pamar I am waiting for the proof where u said that you gave him permission about that, as u didn't know about that he owned MCHost until today.
