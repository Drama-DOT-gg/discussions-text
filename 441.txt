GevMoe - first, I thought he was a kid trying to learn and do good but i was wrong, today i will tell you the story of player1, pharixnodes, and everything
let's start by pharixnodes it was meant to be a free discord bot hosting we were a team of 5 people each one with a role player was disappeared all day saying he had school "understandable" but he held ownership of the discord server which prevented us from doing changes involving high roles and setting it up but anyway he kept messing with roles while we try to make something professional he was like "that admin under the others" and stuff he refused to be with us in the same role as executives, then when we wanted ownership since he was gone all day @vej asked for it but he refused saying why would you need it and stuff... we calmed stuff down and left him with it
days passed and pharixnodes name wasn't fulfilling the idea so 4 of us decided to rename it he was at school when he came we informed him we're renaming the server then he became "how dare you rename without even telling me while im the main owner and founder of this" wait a minute now we have a main owner and not main owner? also, he was at school all day and barely do a thing at night ?? he said he made the team and picked the name oh it was vej who gathered the team and built it not him, he paid for the nodes? nop that was light, he set up the servers and panel? nop that was wunity first then me, he made dashactyl theme and set it up? nop that was me, he barely did anything and yet he names himself the main owner, at that time i honestly got mad i decided to leave and make my own host, light decided to join me too so is vej but i honestly felt bad, he's a kid trying to learn and felt like betraying and that can cause him to never became better (or as i thought) i told him ill still help him if he needs any, and i told vej and light there's no need to leave his host since im the one who fought him.
days have passed he got new members started his dictatorship, vej who was an executive has become an admin and he has become owner only one, while wunity has become a developer (wunity didn't really care he decided to stay developer even when we made executive role)
stuff didnt go well with pharix he fu the panel so many times and ruined a lot of stuff so i told him why dont he shut it down and come work as a helper with us and learn how to do stuff the right way, he agreed then came and did a good job for a while then sudenlly he made a new host called it devnodes and started posting its invite everywhere in the server as he admitted 
then vej was admin in his devnodes he setup panel for him and everything but after he was done he started demoting him and threatening him of kicking so vej decided to leave and before that he changed a line in .env from his panel and a simple "apt-get remove apt" got him a day of downtime since he had no idea how to fix it and had no one who can do it for him
we fixed it for him again and until now i always had that idea of a kid who love tech and trying to learn and do something cool but that wasnt player, (oh i forgotten to mention something vej had a server with around 150member that server was about to close so he gave ownership to player out of trust, when he asked for it back in pharixnodes he refused...)
there's more that i have forgotten about this guy, oh last week he had a server called teched development and had his bot above founder and co-founder role, he went to school and put that bot token in repl someone found the token and started raiding when the co-founder tried to stop the raid he couldn't because Mr player1 had a bot above him that was the longest raid i ever seen ðŸ™‚ 
there's a lot more to say about this guy but thats all i can remember maybe vej can tell more details since my memory dont recall everything but yeah

also for the thing saying im using his logo, that logo wasnt him who made it, it was someone else and it's used as an icon since when i decided to leave pharixnodes I took everything i made with me including dashactyl theme and the icon was there i didn't remove it cuz i was waiting till I make a pro looking one but now he came asking me 15$ for it saying its his (he's not even the one who made it someone else made it and gave it to him for free but what can i say, typical player)
i found this about him here in drama from long time ago :https://drama.gg/d/177-player1-gliz-hosting
ah after i left his host he ones sent a guy to shit-talk us saying you use contabo who uses contabo its shit your host is shit... so the guy had a host i followed the link to find cpanel and whmcs checked for whmcs license there was none checked for cpanel there was none, checked for ip it was google cloud
the guy he sent used a cracked license for cpanel and whmcs and used carding for getting google cloud license and started to shit talk saying we bad then he said he's just testing and left...
