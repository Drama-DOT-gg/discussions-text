Akash_ - This isn't about Contabos Services - so I've just tagged it with Bad Support.

So recently, around 1 month ago, I bought two Contabo VPS's, the story of that is that there servers go down with a 2gb attack launched on them, and I wouldn't reccomend you using their services unless you like having your emails spammed.

With the constant DDoS attacks, they decided to suspend my account, completely shutting down all my servers. I later got an email saying I could never use Contabo again, I decided to take this as a loss and ask for the servers to be put back up for data to be restored. They did so without a fuss. 

I was encouraged by some people to leave a bad review, and so I did. A couple hours later I got this email from the Contabo Billing Department 

They were trying to bribe me for me to remove my review, despite saying I can not use their services. As we all know - companies trying to bribe clients info removing reviews is strictly forbidden under Trustpilot's ToS - so I decided to play along. And golly, they actually refunded me. 

Yea, so that's the story so far. I'll keep this thread updated as I plan on emailing Trustpilot's team.

Akash_ - P.s I cba to properly make the images look nice right now as I'm on mobile so pls no kill
MCKingSam - I doubt Contabo even know this site exists, nor will they care about it.
Tomas - MCKingSam I assume it's just to make people aware, Sam
Akash_ - MCKingSam You probably need a thread of your own mate. And maybe while we're at it a DNDW tag.

Abooz - Ah yes contabo........ 
They want all of your personal details to order
Takes a year for their epyc rome server to reinstall
DDoS Protection = none xD
Takes your vps/dedi down over a 1gbps attack
Very nice isn't it?

Akash_ - JAY ikik, tip in general is just to delete them. I just found this extremely funny (or at least to me and my weird sense of humor)
Deleted User - Abooz
