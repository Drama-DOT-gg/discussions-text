catab12 - so ok
i know i am poor so i just created this to know the bests host out there but i need
1 that the host is at least cheap 2$ per gb or less
2 it got proof of not being over allocated
3 usa/ canada/ sud america nodes or just have super low ping
and then i dont mind if its shared
so thats it just say some good host and ill ad them to the poll
Robert - If you're looking for an affordable Minecraft hosting provider you could also consider KUBBUR
Timanttikuutio - why list apex there if one of your requirements is 2$/GB or less? apex's pricing starts at 4.50$ for 1GB lmao
catab12 - Timanttikuutio because i already know it but it should be an option in the poll
awsamboi - VelocityNode.NET
XenonHost.CO 

I'm using both hosts and they're good for me. Also Cheap.
LandonHalley - catab12 Jeekie.Host
MaiDub - vyxterhost or ghowli are not bad options
Scripted - https://dsc.gg/fr33host
you can get their premium plan + its cheap
NetworthJoiner - Get a vps from velocitynode
Scripted - Scripted + they don't overallocation, dm me for proof Scripted.#0001
sus_person - catab12 Although I am late, I would recommend Humbleservers and SoulNode.net
