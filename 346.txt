Infinite Resources Scam: ​https://everything.is-bannable.xyz/em87e08cA.png (all you get is swap and not actual ram)
they only got 1 16 gb ram contabo vps... ​https://everything.is-bannable.xyz/em3C4E4eE.png so they just give you swap in plan 2 and 3...

they got 1 node: https://everything.is-bannable.xyz/emF5a5b1A.png

claiming to have 50 gb swap and telling people it's ram: https://everything.is-bannable.xyz/emcc5C94b.png https://everything.is-bannable.xyz/em0CA3E11.png

dchu096 - Hi chirag. let me answer some of your questions

EVERY FREE GAME HOST DO SWAP. Why dont you look at falixnodes, winterhoax, summerhost. they all uses swap. Dont complain on swap here, theres no unlimited resources in this world.

TOS are generated as theres no point writing a TOS when a generated version works just fine

and we cant afford to put 22000 dollars to buy barebone until we grow larger, a contabo vps for a hosting does the job here. Its a free host and we paying for servers dont expect much.

Hibernate does save resources thats how we save resources for more people to enjoy from

You get kicked (banned after) for drama and we expected this to happen so im waiting for you.



Let me talk about you for 2 seconds: Stop using better discord. you should go read discord TOS. Dont blame us if your acc gets banned!
Parasiting - Listen Chirag actually there is no point in defaming us , we have only 1 node for now because we just started the host and i know who is behind this , swap is a general thing .
The second complaint is that we use generated tos , whats wrong with that .
So , stop this . We already reported you to discord so take your post back if you want your account to be alive .

  they do use swap, but they don't say that it's ram, you are saying you got 64 gb ram instead of 16 gb

    no, tos generators are not fine, you should consider making your own ToS and privacy policy

    you are promising infinite resources but you got limited resources

    you shouldn't suspend servers for disabling hibernate
    
 You get kicked (banned after) for drama and we expected this to happen so im waiting for you.
    no where it says, "drama isn't allowed" in your server rules ​https://everything.is-bannable.xyz/em01eb448.png

Oh yeeees, Free Infinite Swap Host - WinterHoax join now
dchu096 - yes i messed up. winterhoax is drama.gg. the other 2 is surely a host
Deleted User - dchu096 Oh yeeees, Free Infinite Swap Host - drama.gg join now
NeilGamingYT - The owner litrary dosent care about his staff, all he cares about is money. I setted up his panel after he begged me in the dms and just banned me because one guy said lies without enough proof, and some messges on discord dms dosent mean that it is a truth. I have no offence against the host but i really dont like the owner(dont mind my grammer)
NeilGamingYT - can a mod delete this thread as theres no point in it
dchu096 - i give up as well.  chriag does have a point.
Parasiting - NeilGamingYT Well neil was banned because he gave free resources to members and didnt care about our premium member's privacy and raided their servers .
NeilGamingYT - That's not call raiding, It was a real bug. Giving resources? Wasen't I co-owner?
NeilGamingYT - And chirag does have a point and he's right, but please stop using betterdiscord thanks
Parasiting - NeilGamingYT a bug which says to sub to your friend ?
NeilGamingYT - He wasen't even my friend at that time(we had a fight)
Parasiting - NeilGamingYT thats the reason why you did it cuz u thought I would believe that it was Raghav and cancel the deal with him .
NeilGamingYT - He already dmed me about the deal/parternership and already he said i wont make a video on the host so yes there was no point in me doing that, it was probably a hater of him that is pretending to be him, If you want we can continue this discussions in dm group with Dchu(the other co owner that tried to defend you)
NeilGamingYT - I didn't tell anyone to make this thread it was by them and not me(you said " i know who is behind this")
NeilGamingYT - Stop fighting you will get nothing out of this
dchu096 - NeilGamingYT 
wdym? i already wrecked this in pieces now.
NeilGamingYT - dchu096 okay, you owned every single part of the host( i mean the domain without the doamin nothing will work)
dchu096 - He owns the backup domain you know right?
NeilGamingYT - does he know how to change domain in pterodactyl tho?, even if he does why tf should we care
dchu096 - NeilGamingYT your right. If he does its his own issue. Ive done my job
EmeraldMike - dchu096

EmeraldMike - EmeraldMike  that's when yk they rushed the host release
NeilGamingYT - He payed for the vps so why tf is it listed as illigal operation?
Parasiting - I paid for the vps bruh
https://prnt.sc/114v97i
NeilGamingYT - @Jedrik remove illiegal operation as its not
NeilGamingYT - Parasiting the recipt from ur bank, give us that(that it took money from ur acc)
Chirag - NeilGamingYT they currently don't have a ToS. The one they had was also kinda invalid.
NeilGamingYT - Now, I AM NO LONGER CONNECTED TO PARASITING IN ANY way, so do not contact me about parasiting.
NeilGamingYT - Chirag welp rip idc
Chirag - NeilGamingYT we know that
dchu096 - Chirag im out too!
Parasiting - dchu096 cool
Deleted User - Imma just sit and watch the show.
dchu096 - If this is gonna get legal issues then stay away from it. No one wanna getlegal on their head i dont wanna go to court for this.
NeilGamingYT - dchu096 ok
