LukaBoi - Its called "Beap Host"
LukaBoi - I asked them if i can purchase, they said yes.
When i asked for tos and pp they said its in procces of making lmao.
Kowone - They do purchases shit through discord
TME - Kowone We didn't even officially release sooo yea. Also I don't really care about what you guys say. I don't think Beap Hosting is even going to start because of low funding ðŸ˜… So don't try making fun of it ;p;
TME - LukaBoi Hmm, tell me a host that I have made before that closed.
LukaBoi - TME Host with fallen, host with black kitten, catservice, host with ace, and much more that i dont remember
EdwardSnowde - Yall are going outrageous for a host not having legal documents. Here where I live (United States, Texas) and they charge 40 dollars JUST TO FILE, Your not guarenteed a LLC or a DBA
