BaconHead - It looks really sus
But maybe they're just making their website?
dchu096 - BaconHead could be, but they have 17 sites. i guess to have a host that can own 17 sites they should have at least a homepage. plus they have a yt videos and a working panel!
panel: https://panel.mehost.dk/auth/login
billing: https://billing.mehost.dk/
the YT video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQambbjavlw
dchu096 - already confirmed? yikes such as world record confirm tag
Jedrik - Seems the host has been long dead, don't know where you got that they used gratisvps, only things I can vouch for here are the no tos and no prp
dchu096 - Jedrik hmm... one of my friend sent it to me today asking me to change my host name. im like why? and he sent me the link, so i post it here. Its not long dead tho registered in 2021!
dchu096 - They mentioned about gratis here in the title - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-02/1625207377-582076-image.png
Jedrik - dchu096 They basically meant "Free MC Hosting" - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-02/1625207448-558465-image.png
dchu096 - Hmm... i will update my title a bit then
comfyy - their main web page is hosted on Hetzner and they talk about Gratis VPS? I did a little bit of digging. It is a Danish domain so I translated Gratis in Danish into English  

confirmed they dont use Gratis VPS. No TOS or PP and bad website is still relevant

I didnt see Jedirks post. yikes - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-02/1625208304-506474-image.png
dchu096 - yeah my bad, i didnt notice they used danish lol ðŸ˜…
k7h - I just want to let you know they have a front page now, they are under construction and that's why they didn't have a front page, and they are not doing anything Illegal.
dchu096 - Then how do they have a panel on standby and a youtube video while they are under construction?????
i still dont see terms of service or privacy policy.
