SirCat - https://discord.com/invite/r5hFv4G9vv


SeaNodes created by the user HailNot_ he clearly cant follow his own damn rules, like 3 users got banned just for asking arctic for the miner src or for him to make one i never saw something that said that was against the rules, and i dont got banned for asking why they got banned for asking for a miner, he claimed i "swore" then he banned me from roztnodes cuz he literally dont know how to communicate with ppl he also avoided my question.
and ive had a difficult time getting a vpn so i can join on an alt, but i had to make a new acc on proton.



only screenshot i got before he banned my alt his going all after me lol - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-20/1639987342-549959-image.png

HaiNot_ - SirCat He dm advertised on one of the devs dm so I banned him

isnt dm advertising
Aplimmm - in what world giving member administrator perm is not a nuke
SirCat - Aplimmm WHAT FR LOLLOOLLOOLLO
HaiNot_ - Aplimmm We fixed it lmfao not even 1 member got kicked
SirCat - you know they also want members to have admin experience next hour they will give everoyne pterodactyl admin and then vps access
Aplimmm - i see the audit when some staff giving admin perm to all member and then i just got ban/kicked like is that not counting nuke?
Aplimmm - HaiNot_ explain why i not in server
HaiNot_ - SirCat buy "vps for me" i am making a hosting to a hosting owner? that's the reason i banned him, he also dmed one of the devs links to send money to his paypal

zehan - HaiNot_ u r a noob idiot
Aplimmm - HaiNot_ its an old proof when sircat own qloxhost but its diffrent you cant say ppl abuse without newest proof kid.
SirCat - zehan nah im fine
HaiNot_ - zehan kid, stop begging for credit cards, I know 5 year olds dont have credit cards but still you can ask your parents 🤣
HaiNot_ - Aplimmm Yes, I talked about old proofs, not about new ones, probably your head couldn't register it properly 🤣
SirCat - HaiNot_ you laugh at ur own dumb jokes?
Aplimmm - HaiNot_ you dint even mention about that shit. kid
HaiNot_ - Aplimmm calling everyone kids? only kids would do that
Aplimmm - HaiNot_ then you are kid to since you called zehan kid. and atleas i am a smart kid that school not like you duh
SirCat - HaiNot_ no ive seen older ppl call other ppl kids, and by that i mean from the age of 10 to 19
HaiNot_ - SirCat you told I banned 3 people but you sent 1 photo, you don't have any proof of me banning 3 people
HaiNot_ - SirCat Kids tell every sentence with the word "kid"
Aplimmm - HaiNot_ if you have brain you should know he said "only screenshot i got before he banned my alt"
HaiNot_ - Aplimmm I don't use every sentence with the word "kid"
SirCat - HaiNot_ cuz u banned me u fucking retard, did u even read the thread
Aplimmm - HaiNot_ scroll from this msg to up to the first msg i sent to this thread and i dint use word kid on every sentence
Soul - HaiNot_  2 people got banned for asking arctic to make them a miner and sircat for unknown reasons.
i can screenshot that if you want.
zehan - what?
HaiNot_ - Soul Arctic told me to ban them, They were other host owners.
Aplimmm - HaiNot_ banning ppl bc they are other host owner? really?
HaiNot_ - HaiNot_ looking for DM advertising and getting devs from us.
SirCat - HaiNot_ so you ban other host owners, wtf
HaiNot_ - Aplimmm No.
Aplimmm - this thread making me hungry gtg
HaiNot_ - SirCat We don't ? We ban other host owners who are looking for devs from our hosting or staff.
SirCat - HaiNot_ ... u do know ur devs arent fucking slaves for u someone else can dm them and has full rights to  do so and ask them questions or ask them if they also wanna work for them
HaiNot_ - SirCat But if the devs ask me to ban the person who dmed it's their choice right?
HaiNot_ - And arctic is one of the owners lol
zehan - @everyone anyone would help me make my host
HaiNot_ - zehan this isn't the place to make a hosting with abused nodes, go somewhere else and advertise
SirCat - HaiNot_ and i dont remember seeing "dont ask for help or dm your staff if they wanna work for them" in the rules
SirCat - so another false ban besides, just cause they asked for help or if they would wanna work for them doesnt mean BAN
zehan - HaiNot_ not asking u
HaiNot_ - SirCat If the developers think they don't want to be dmed or they think it's a Dm advert then I am free to ban them right?
Soul - @HaiNot_  offtopic but does the linkvertise coin earning thingy make anything? (i think it was taken from my github idk)
SirCat - HaiNot_ NO, are u high wtf is wrong with u, then add a fucking rule saying they cant do that
SirCat - Soul i dont rlly know why ppl use linkvertise for dashactyl, it gets them some profit sure, but not alot, and linkvertise is just annoying to go through
Soul - SirCat Mcworld originally made it, i recreated it. I dont know how much it makes so i asked him. Links made through the api for linkvertise(the way mcworld and i do it) takes one click.
HaiNot_ - Soul What's your discord Username?
Soul - HaiNot_ definitelynotsoul#5207
HaiNot_ - Soul ah ok
__SECRET__ - Aplimmm is this DM advert too??
__SECRET__ - idiot nuke means spamming @everyone and deleting all channels and spamming shit
__SECRET__ - and then banning everyone
Aplimmm - its not the only meaning of nuke and they also ban me for no reason before ever i chat in this thread lmao
Loser - lol
Arctic - SirCat , like 3 users got banned just for asking arctic for the miner src or for him to make one i never saw something that said that was against the rules

hailnot says its cuz u where dming users asking them for a card or something 

HaiNot_ Arctic told me to ban them, They were other host owners.

SirCat - Arctic so whos lying
Aaron_ - I need a TLDR for the 114 posts.
