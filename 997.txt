LuckyTarget - Hello there, I own a discord botlist that I put on github on the condition that people use it only if they do not delete the credits! As you can see in the video below, but also in the images, they do not respond, and they also ban me after the video ends. I obtained a lot of information about them, including Server IDs and owner IDs, as well as screenshots from their website!

Their website: vatorie.xyz
My website project: https://github.com/Astra-Development/Discord-Bot-List
My footer Credits:  
Their footer:

As you can see, they are very different. They also deleted who created the website and replaced it with their names. - https://imgur.com/kKsc37I.png
