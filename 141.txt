Saqib - Hey! So i have recently gotten DMed advertised this host. They had the SAME logo as falixnodes so i went to check it out and told my friend WIthdrawal(Also a staff of FalixNodes). 

As shown in the diagram above, what he done was unnaceptable!

So i then join and was shocked to see this. Their nodes were literally the SAME as falix...so they were possibly reselling falix..

Another thing that shocked me so much was their level rewards!

5TB Disk for 20levels? Niceeeee

As said before they operated under a falixnodes logo


They then had the audacity of blaming withdrawal for "raiding the server". He literally done nothing in the server and said like a few words...


They also raided their own server to make him look bad.. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-12-12/1607803973-414313-kekee.png
