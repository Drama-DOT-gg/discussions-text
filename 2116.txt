SagnikDas - Hello Guys So recently I was looking for a minecraft server hosting and guess what I found this hosting, It seems to be suspicious because when I saw there nodes ip, they all were from different hostings For Example: Linode, SC Lithuanian Radio and TV (idk what is this) &amp; Contabo, In the starting I thought maybe they are not abusing but then when they sended a message where they wrote "ordered 2x RYZEN 9 Singapore node" and more messages almost every day then I got to be sure that they are using free trials.... 

Also the owner was very known called Dustin, I got to know from a guy name Malice that he was scammed from Dustin.

Ip Addresses Of The Servers:
194.195.113.156 
89.116.26.91
194.233.69.133
