Aaron_ - Interesting.
Aaron_ - Could you send the invite link to their server?
Rylan_Ezekiel - Aaron_ https://discord.gg/uzwr4fFBG9
Aaron_ - Seems like they recently opened. You shouldn't target new hosts for that.
Rylan_Ezekiel - Aaron_ alr , but just check the hostname , in some channels its different
Aaron_ - Also why are they using ControlPanel? What's wrong with dashactyl lol

JR1 - They just started, give them some time to sort stuff out... and dashactyl doesn't suck
