Chirag - Fluxirya technically, it's your fault.
Mc servers are easy to grief if not setup properly, they bungee spoofed lol
Timanttikuutio - Fluxirya you didn't setup your bungee properly, the griefer probably just bought a server on the same node as ur on and spoofed it(notice how it says the connection is coming from 172.18.0.1, that's pterodactyls internal network)
Fluxirya - Timanttikuutio  im using a vps :/
Fluxirya - Chirag  i don't think so i have bungeeguard and its on online modes
Chirag - Fluxirya hm ipwhitelist plugin
Fluxirya - Chirag   i've got some backups i just want to expose this guy, not only my server , but others too
Chirag - Fluxirya what's your server store and discord?
Fluxirya - Chirag  its a little private server for my friends
Chirag - Fluxirya oh, well uh, bungee spoofs are common, most server owners can't fix it
Fluxirya - Chirag its fine again i want to expose him because my friends get this too and most pepole i know met this guy :/
