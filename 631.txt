luffyy - so Fallen#3333 used to be a manager in arkhost he was a manager for quite some time but as time passed i found out who he really was. he had good intentions but kept making mistakes after mistakes such as leaking a purchased theme and leaking bot information. I let him slide that time but soon he admitted to helping Bad nuke other hosts. i no longer wanted him as a part of arkhost so when i demoted him, he had immediately nuked every node arkhost has and raided its discord leaving it dead. he later on went to dox me. [out of anger i had leaked his ip and deleted his github organisation]

luffyy - @ItsAceCraft is now threatening tme as he is a part of this thread
Daftscientist - lollllll TME been threatened.
ItsAceCraft - Who is the Partner? And What is my past with CatServices?
The person which TME refers "partner" is me. Yes, I boosted CatServices not to see if there Nodes are bad. Previously I opened a thread and I wrote that CatServices had Bad Performance. Well that time I did not notice they have a process call "CPU Hibernation" that usually uses very less CPU when no one is playing the server [Which is absolutely a Genius Idea in my Opinion]. So After sometime Ryan told me how and why my server tps was so low. So I started feeling guilty and so I boosted there server. I did not even asked them to give my resources. I  just opened the ticket and pinged TME with the Screenshot I boosted. 

Well you may ask me why I am writing this here?
 I am writing this because At this moment what he refers "Partner" and "Group" does not mean I am his Partner who tried to bring down CatServices. Instead I boosting is cause I feel Guilty because I complained and wrote a thread without acctually consulting thr Owners regarding the performance. 

What is FyreNodes and about it:
And Talking about FyreNodes here, Fallen, Dishit and I own FyreNodes. We did not even released the host and neither the Domain or Nodes are bought yet. I don't know how but TME is mentioning the FyreNodes has Bad nodes which does not make a sense. 

About the threads by TME and Luffy on Fallen:
Well TME is not lying. This is Fallen's usual Habit to say me and TME that we are bad at coding and stuff. But after I became partners with him, he only says TME is bad at coding and said CatServices is bad. Yes it is true that Fallen has said he will DDOS CatServices but I don't really know if he actually means that. Personally Fallen is sometimes really rude to me but he is not bad. He said me he apologized to Luffy but he said luffy said him some bad stuff and blocked him. 

My Conclusion: 
Yes, Fallen is Salty to TME. I personally tried to fix this problem by making a group but it ended pretty Badly by Luffy starting to be salty to Fallen and Fallen starts and I removed Fallen so I am talk in Peace to Luffy and TME.

Anything Else I wanna say?
WHERE THE HELL IS THE PROOF LUFFY THAT I AM THREATNING TME TBH. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-02/1622630410-13892-image.png
ItsAceCraft - TME Yeah I did cause I wanted to make a private smp with me and my friends duh
ItsAceCraft - luffyy Oh yeah do you see this? Its joke right luffy? - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-02/1622630490-475998-image.png
luffyy - I see that your threathening worked then - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-02/1622630728-517285-kpfcdulht9a.png
ItsAceCraft - luffyy Thats not a threat, its I just saying. Atleast I did not say that "I will DDOS you and CatServices" like Fallen did. I did say that if he wants to play it the way he is doing now then I will play in the way he is playing this as now. [Basically If I am giving him threats that means I am not his friend and if he lies about me then I ain't his friend] - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-02/1622631120-85222-image.png
luffyy - From the pictures you just look like your abusing friendship
Puggo - Soo... arknodes is gone now?
luffyy - Nah I'm talking about arkhost fallen raided it and it rebranded to arknodes
Jamie_ - luffyy Jamie his retarded friend had also helped him raid the discord

Don't bring me into this, I just gave him the bot token. I didn't tell him to do it, encourage him or anything like that.
luffyy - Jamie_ well in the picture he clearly says that you told him to raid the server
Jamie_ - luffyy No, learn to read. He said he received a call from me showing the token. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-02/1622638730-748129-image.png
luffyy - jamie then connected with a discord bot client
Jamie_ - luffyy And? Does that say at all that I told him to do it? Am I missing the sarcasm? Is it another language?
Google translate thinks its english? - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-02/1622639013-392843-image.png
luffyy - i was there when the raid happened the one who talked to me via the bot was the one who banned me and the other admins then the bot code was executed
Jamie_ - luffyy That doesn't say it was me anywhere, stop bringing me into this.
Jamie_ - luffyy - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-02/1622646725-705429-image.png
Jamie_ - I want to clear a couple things too. I remember the day fallen nuked ark, and it was not a fun one. After he had done it he has DMd me "I fucked up". Neither me or my friends could get a hold of him for a good few days. I am not at all saying what he did was right, but atleast he realized that he fucked up. And thanks to drama.gg, we have learned, that most people can't even admit that, when instead fallen admitted everything in the first couple screenshots. 
Again, I am not saying what he did was right, but atleast he admitted to his ways. Luffy, I do not know if you know this, but ArkHost was Fallen's best ever time in the hosting industry. He enjoyed every second of it and always would tell me so. That is the reason he DMd you admitting everything. Cut him some slack. He took responsibility for his fuck up and admitted it. Like I said, most people can't yet he did. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-02/1622651532-43262-image.png
luffyy - thats the biggest bull crap i heard. his toxicity never stopped even after that. lets not forget how racist he is
Koisip - luffyy rip arkhost 

died because man's self-greed
Jamie_ - luffyy He isn't racist wtf
luffyy - he called me an indian scammer ever since he knew i was indian
luffyy - And @Jamie_ your still a bad person as well - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-03/1622684443-568145-screenshot-20210204-211453-comdiscord-1.jpg
Fallen - "none of this would be posted on winterhoax btw"
Well its here luffy. Its here...
luffyy - when i said that never expected that you would do all this shit
Jamie_ - luffyy I never said I was perfect and as stated in the screenshot I tried stopping the bot as I realised that it was wrong to do. This can be proven as there were still a good 300 members left and 10 channels left.
Jamie_ - luffyy Well that now makes you look like a complete liar, nobody will trust you anymore. You are making yourself look bad now in this post.
Jamie_ - luffyy Let me also point out luffy, you are a bad person too. You nuked fallens github, knowing that had years worth of projects on it. You are just as bad as him.
luffyy - I aldready admitted doing that and his organisation wasn't even a month ol when I nuked it
luffyy - Jamie_ that's cuz we kicked the bot retard
luffyy - Jamie_ sure
Jamie_ - luffyy He literally DMed you saying he had old stuff on there, he had just uploaded it to the github.
Jamie_ - luffyy You had no clue at the time, you are trying to make me look bad like I didn't try stop it when I did. At the speed it was deleting channels you would have no clue until it was done. I stopped it just after the command was executed so only 10 channels were removed.
Daftscientist - Jamie_ so NOW your leaking dms and you got mad at me for leaking dms with luffy, very sus
Jamie_ - Daftscientist I have no clue who you are and I was told I could send it.
Jamie_ - Daftscientist - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-04/1622817847-507560-image.png
TME - All issues with fallen have been fixed. He is a really nice guy after all. I just did not realise it at first.
Aplimmm - TME you really take a year to say that?
luffyy - You can't call a guy who nuked an entire host cause he got demoted "nice"
Two - this is the retardism drama.gg is facing currently. (no offense to people who are actually retarded)

this is currently Fallen's thread... not Jamie's. 

all of you guys are &lt;18 years old and we all make mistakes and have anger issues. + everyone changes and learns from their mistakes.

even though it might take time for someone to gain reputation again after doing a regretful mistake, you shouldn't entirely a bitch about it and should realize you're all normal people.

and yes I can rep both Fallen and Jamie are chill people now.
