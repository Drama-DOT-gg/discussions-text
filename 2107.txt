Jen - Currently the host is taking people's money and running off with it yet somehow unable to activate servers or provide any legitimate services. This company is apparently shutting down but pulling a nigh on everyone.

Also the owner of this host needed a reminder of the definition of fraud and saying it was beyond his control. Which is total BS because if your the owner how do you not have control of your own servers unless your BadSK and take servers given to you by community donors ðŸ’€ðŸ’€
In other words stay away from this scammy host
But for everyone who wants to make this host more of a meme and check this host out just like me who trolls in these scammer hosts. The Discord is https://discord.gg/JqvbSVtJvn
