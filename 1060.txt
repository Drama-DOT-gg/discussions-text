dchu096 - So this is what happened, 

having a bad time with zach because he was mad at me trying to accuse him on that DDOS thing.

yes that is not zachery, that case belong to xoomoo and hes the person wrecked mehost v1. Im trying to cover this so i have to slam this to zachery on a public forum and make him carry.

On a few bans might also be the reason of us being an totally unprofessional staff team and we are working our way to adjust that issue. 

For the lying we did have to cover a lot of past but i do realise this is not the way to run host by covering past. I do want to apologise on this issue on the lies i caused in regards to mehost.

Sorry zach for this mess we caused, i will go revise on my own lesson.


Quitting mehost. Thankyou for all knowing about me. I would also like to thank my staff for being their patience and helpfulness.

Kind Regards

dchu096

Expect in a few days mehost will start going 404.

Thought we never lost to drama.gg but unfortunately i guess i underestimated its power.
Deleted User - Drama.gg is not powerful in anyway it is the content in this forum and the community who are ambitious in exposing and stoping fraudulent hosting services
dchu096 - Zachery indeed. Thanks for stating it out.
