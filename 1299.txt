Dubs - At 12:46PM today, I noticed the number of members in my server (MCWorld) dropping fast. I went straight to audit logs and noticed that someone was banning members. (Over 1k members were banned).


I decided to scroll back in the audit logs to see how this user got permissions to ban everyone and I saw that Dyno gave them the role.



So confused, I checked the dyno dashboard where it told me that @Shershah actually set the autorole to give users the "System Admin" role that has admin permissions. 


I got information from one of my good friends RusJS that the user is actually Shershah's alt.


I just recommend you stay away from Shershah and never trust him with staff and/or permissions in your server!!

Ples - no i own that discord server and im sure as shit not shershah
Aaron_ - Reported to Discord yet?
Dubs - Ples Apologies, I have only just noticed i pasted the wrong link.
Dubs - Aaron_ I dont believe I could get his main banned for this. I can definitely get his alt banned but not too sure about his main. I will be reporting both of them right now.
Aaron_ - UnKnOwN_GuY Looks like shershah's alt to me
Geo - @Dubs LMFAO didnt you banned hes alt? or let him ban everyone also manually banning users isnt raid
Shershah - What punishment we should give to anyone for stealing someone's money or account?
Shershah - Banning 1k members is tooo less. According to it. Also that karma4u is not me.
Shershah - According to section 379 of indian penal code:
Whoever commits theft shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both. 379A. Snatching.
lucaiscool - man pulled out the fucking law book
Shershah - lucaiscool Nah Ik this already as my Family belongs to law enforcements.
Shershah - Also that part is googled as I was not sure about my knowledge.

Cain - Shershah Dubs eraters 

Hi All,

I am one of the 3 Founders of Flow Nodes, My role primarily is to purchase and supply the servers involved in the Flow Node environment. I can confirm personally no machine we use or have ever used has been a trial machine. 

I would gladly provide proof of Invoices from the start of Flow Nodes to current. I can also provide a full inventory of our devices and proof of payment for each individual device since purchase. If anyone would like me to post the evidence regarding anything I have previously stated I would gladly.

Please, before making any accusations about a company or an individual, get your facts confirmed and actually find physical evidence of the issues you have with the people you are slandering.

Thanks,
Cain

Dubss - Cain Hey, what's your discord?
Cain - Dubss It will be easier if I add you.
Cain - Hi @Shershah,

You attempted to slander Flow Nodes for the usage of "Free Trials" from OVH, I have responded to this comment and have not yet received a response from you. We as the company would like to find out where you have received your information from, and why it was brought up in a ticket about your misdoings.

If Flow Node was doing something that would be deemed suspicious or somewhat illegal there should be a thread opened up with the relevant evidence being posted alongside this. Please may you respond so we can see what your intention behind this was and why you deemed it necessary?

Yours Sincerely,
Cain
Shershah - Cain bruuh. Just check ip. It is from ovh.
Cain - Shershah 

Correct it is from OVH, so that makes the server a free trail? I don't seem to see your logic behind this.
LiquidInteract - Hi Shershah,

I am currently Staff over at Flow Node, I have known Cain for a while now, enough to say he doesn't use trials, the servers used to host Flow's sites are paid for. I have personally seen evidence of him paying for the machines. Flow has been around for many months and at this point past the 30 Day OVH Trial Period. The machine itself has had the same IP the whole time confirming the machine is not a trial. Cain is hard worker, and personally funds every server Flow Node Uses.

Yours Sincerely,
LiquidInteract
Staff @ Flow Node
Shershah - Ok? Ig
SirCat - Shershah so u just go and call out ppl for abusing free trials if they use ovh...
Cain - SirCat Clearly, he tried calling my host out, but when you question him for evidence all he responded with was "bruuh. Just check ip. It is from ovh". How does an OVH IP say Free Trial?
Ples - Cain thats what i said, @Shershah just cuz some ppl use ovh doesnt mean they use free trials, btw when will u show proof of them using ovh free trials, never? though so.
Cain - Ples The 100% evidence he has xD
Ples - Cain i wanted to upload a kewl meme but drama.gg doesnt allow mp4's :/
Jamie_ - Cain nah bro, in these kids worlds, having an IP at all MUST mean a free trial
Ples - Jamie_ his litteraly older than me and he shershah still thinks like that ðŸ¤£
Dubs - Shershah ovh = free trial yes totally ðŸ‘€
Shershah - eraters yes ovh also have free trail
Shershah - when u are blind. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-18/1639795151-557626-screenshot-20211218-080746.jpg
Cain - Shershah 

Explain what you are trying to say here?
lucaiscool - Shershah nah i thought the free trial was paid tbh
Ples - lucaiscool me too
Shershah - Cain I used "maybe" and "ig".Doesnt mean i m fully confirmed.
