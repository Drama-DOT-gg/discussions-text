Bxrk - Alright, back at it again. With another free shit £1 a GB RAM host..

First off they use VelocityNode... Wow... It's pretty overpriced on your website for VelocityNode.. Legit its better off buying from Velocity.


Owner is pretty rude, didnt even try helping, he just went "Do it yourself"

He even admitted his server was shit.

https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/730023081489203241/821114534739312710/unknown.png


He has to manually give people the member role...

They will probably delete my server when I post this lol

Unfortuantly couldnt run the OREO API to see the actual stats.



Even told me to host it on my host.

https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/741035535388246063/821116128481771600/unknown.png

I like my up time low down low 

https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/741035535388246063/821116445789650954/unknown.png


When we (Microbot &amp; me) ask him a question asking about his host.... He always says "Why?" Like bruhhh



He legit said this £1 a GB RAM host....

Probs gonna get banned when i post this lol


I will reply when updates happen 😃
Bxrk - also their co owner has DNDW
Fallen - We do have a tos. You just do not know the URL of it. As the website is still in development.
Bxrk - Fallen I was guided to that URL by your owner. Jex
CertifiedDog - shit host
Fallen - https://dijxcloud.com/terms
CertifiedDog - Fallen maybe update the website
Fallen - We are currently working on that.
CertifiedDog - how about you get your owner jex on instead of you protecting that host, you have do not deal with lolllll
CertifiedDog - Fallen why are you providing hosting when you dont have a tos
MicroBot - Fallen I am sorry, but your website is a fucking template so I can edit it LMAO
Fallen - So? I have do not deal with because I did bad stuff, Does not mean I cannot defend a host I Co-Own with valid reason._
Bxrk - MicroBot LMAOOOO
CertifiedDog - lollll
CertifiedDog - u use template lol

Bxrk - lmao
JexUK - Back at it again with the 13 year olds...

Firstly:
We are not just using one provider. We use multiple providers ranging from startups to leading companies in the industry. 
Secondly:
We have a TOS. I made a mistake when speaking to you, where I directed you to the wrong link - I apologise for that, but the terms have been active this whole time.
Thirdly:
£1/GB for 24/7 Minecraft hosting on AMD EPYC CPU's with unlimited SSD storage is not in any way a bad price. We need to make profit while providing a good price and customer experience, which is why our prices are as they are. They are subject to change, on deals and such.
Fourthly:
We do not provide free services. When you beg us repetitively for free servers when we explicitly are paid-only, you're pushing my limits. I'm going to be annoyed if it's the 50th time you've asked - ESPECIALLY as you have your own hosting service with servers!

Also, some smaller points you made:
We have an automatic system in place to assign the role. 
We have stated that previous providers were not up to Dijx standard, so we no longer use those providers. We want the end user to have the best experience possible and this is an example of the changes we have made to improve customer service.

I don't know what you're trying to achieve by doing this - but reply if you wish to contradict my statement.
CertifiedDog - shit host
JexUK - CertifiedDog Don't really know what your point is with this... We made a twitter account and we needed to verify a phone number and I didn't get round to it lmao. Funny tweets coming soon I promise
Bxrk - because its a bad host and it should not even be a thing lmao
JexUK - CertifiedDog This is a very valid point backed up with very valid evidence, I appreciate that lmaooo
CertifiedDog - JexUK bro just delete it that would be more funny
Bxrk - you use velocitynode and resell even more money lmao i dont understand its better just buying a veloityvps
JexUK - Bxrk We use a company called VelocityNode for one of our webservers. Is there a problem with that?
Bxrk -  - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-03-15/1615841728-177015-image.png

Bxrk - lul @MicroBot - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-03-15/1615841755-775358-image.png
MicroBot - Bxrk ikr
JexUK - Bxrk Ah yeah, we used to use Arc to make money as we were a free platform. Removing it now, thanks for spotting that 🙂
CertifiedDog - paid host and it has arc even worst
JexUK - CertifiedDog As I just said, we're removing it now, thanks for spotting that. We used that site on our old page
Bxrk - Nice they banned me for posting the link to winterhoax he said dont bring this here.

lmao
Bxrk - JexUK stfu stupid shit host
Bxrk - tbh i dont even know anymore




he deleted my account and when i got my account, he made the password 123... - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-03-15/1615841999-949024-image.png
JexUK - Bxrk rule 6 sir - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-03-15/1615842026-9786-image.png
Bxrk - does anyone have a link to the discord?
Jamie_ - Fuck yes  I have so much to say. I just want to point out I know the owner Jex and he bought a fucking contabo server when I worked there.
i9-9900k my ass. He said in my winterhoax about them that they would buy a VPS per 4 clients. b r u h.

And I know this guy, there is no way he will buy dedis. This company has been "in beta" since last december and they still have not released after 4 months. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-03-15/1615841929-981892-image.png

Bxrk -  - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-03-15/1615842180-439001-image.png
Jamie_ - JexUK cut out the bit where it says if its edited 😉
JexUK - Jamie_ 9900K servers are available on Dijx, to buy, now. because we are just so swag.

Also, the 4 clients per VPS thing? I admit, wrong thing to say - we have taken a different approach since then.
Bxrk - 4 months to open it wow you have a discord with members in..
JexUK -  - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-03-15/1615842247-296881-image.png
Jamie_ - JexUK My host released in 1 week, yours is coming close to 1 year
Bxrk - JexUK Jex, you are the cap of the cap
Bxrk - Jamie_ its gonna take him 234 years to open it
CertifiedDog - Close it already
Jamie_ - JexUK Give me a link then ill buy one
Lix - ez just shut down
JexUK - Bxrk I'm not going into specifics about this. But this is also not true. We went into beta in mid-january
JexUK - Jamie_ Sure!
https://portal.dijxcloud.com/store/minecraftux
Bxrk - JexUK You don't have a tos about refunds and billing.. you use arc on your website for tos your tos on your website doesnt work
Bxrk - JexUK just stfu no one gonna buy
Jamie_ - JexUK I can tell that if I buy one I won’t get one as I don’t see any new nodes announced or on your status page
Jamie_ - Bxrk add the scammer tag too
Bxrk - Jamie_  he sure is a scammer so yea
JexUK - Bxrk As previously stated - we used Arc on our old site as we were a free host, we are now removing it with immediate effect. Thanks for pointing that out!
JexUK - Bxrk Lmao scammer? Alright, sure buddy
Bxrk - JexUK shut the fuck up lol
Bxrk - JexUK you are a scammer no cap
Bxrk - Jamie_ cant unfortunately
Jamie_ - JexUK lmao trying to act professional like that in a winterhoax
Bxrk - i think this is  bull shit - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-03-15/1615842499-835860-image.png
JexUK - @Jamie_ right. Because we would offer legit services for a good price and then try and scam people with our high end options lmaooo
JexUK - Bxrk Wanna find out?
Bxrk - Jamie_ lmao yea hes like uSe pRoPeR gRaMarrrrr
Jamie_ - Lemme point out too the price of i9-9900k servers is stupid and if you sell £1 a gig your losing money like wildfire
JexUK - Jamie_ I'm using proper grammar and using facts
Bxrk - JexUK ye, just let my run a python file on your host then
Bxrk - JexUK bull shit
Jamie_ - Bxrk nothing announced or on their status page about it or proved he has a i9 server, add the scammer tag
Bxrk - Jamie_ how i dont use this that often, as i dont encounter many shit hosts
JexUK - Bxrk We don't do free servers, as I've said about 9453327849263 times
JexUK - Jamie_ We don't need to announce every single server we get lmaooo
Bxrk - tryna run @Oreo api rn but he blocked me - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-03-15/1615842662-216226-image.png
Jamie_ - JexUK if you got a fucking i9 you would announce that shit idiot
Bxrk - JexUK bro i have to buy to prove you wrong?
Jamie_ - Bxrk LMAO
JexUK - Jamie_ We have it displayed on our product page
Jamie_ - Bxrk it’s a scam lmao don’t waste your money
Bxrk - JexUK that doesnt show shit allow me to run it
Bxrk - Jamie_ ofc it is duh
Jamie_ - JexUK you just have that you have a i9 that’s it
Bxrk - Jex, allow me to run this python file and i will delete this WinterHoax...
JexUK - Bxrk Why would I owe you anything after how deceptive and spiteful you've been to me?
Jamie_ - Lemme also point out their main server is a contabo VPS with 8gb of ram and 4 vCores of a shitty AMD EPYC
JexUK - Bxrk Send me the file. I will make sure you're not tryna fuck our servers lmaooo
Bxrk - JexUK mate, its not a discord bot it shows us your ram cpu etc
Bxrk - JexUK i can screenshare me opening it
JexUK - Jamie_ Wrong. Again.
JexUK - Bxrk Send it to me, and I will look into it
Bxrk - Jamie_ yep
Bxrk - JexUK no.
Jamie_ - JexUK I worked there for ages and I know this shit
Bxrk - Jamie_ yep
Jamie_ - Bxrk send me it their security is ass
JexUK - Jamie_ Things change. Unlike your maturity level lmaooo
Bxrk - Jex, unblock me on discord... and allow me to run this file it shows me your node specs
Jamie_ - JexUK yeh they do and your still not funny
JexUK - Bxrk Send me the file! Simple as that my friend
JexUK - Jamie_ I'm working on it
Bxrk -  - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-03-15/1615842934-167252-image.png
Jamie_ - JexUK you fucking blocked him idiot
Bxrk - JexUK then unblock me your dick.
JexUK - Bxrk F
Bxrk - you obviously dont want to run this file lmao it shows your node specs thats all
JexUK - Bxrk Idk whether you're trying to say you're or you here but you really gotta improve your grammar man
JexUK - Bxrk Send it to me, once I've unblocked you, and I can change that
Bxrk - JexUK Alright Man, how about you unblock me on Discord and you make me a server and run this file
Bxrk - JexUK im not sending it to you i can screenshare opening it lmao
JexUK - Also what's with the low uptime lmao, 99% guarantee, compensation is given if it's down for longer than that, just sayin
Bxrk - mans came out of his cave - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-03-15/1615843088-774987-image.png
JexUK - Bxrk Not happening. I'm not stupid, I care about security.
JexUK - Bxrk mans did in fact do that
Jamie_ - JexUK when you has your old domain your fucking downtime was 90% so shut your bitch ass as I have a screenshot on my PC but I am on my phone ATM
Bxrk - HAHHAHAH - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-03-15/1615843200-444481-image.png
Jamie_ - JexUK yes a python file ran in docker which is an isolated container is a security risk oh how I love dijx
Jamie_ - Bxrk LMAO
Bxrk - Jamie_ such a risk man, this guy knows everything
JexUK - Jamie_ Yep, as we were in a development stage we were constantly updating and editing the site - or, alternatively, we were switching servers. Although, to be honest, most of the time it was you DDoSing our servers but let's not go there lmaoo
Bxrk - damn you got us we were going to ddos you through a python file
JexUK - Jamie_ Would you want someone who just winterhoaxed you running a random file on your server? No? I thought so
JexUK - Bxrk lmaoo that requires some serious skill
Fallen - Don't you just love arguing with children on WinterHoax???
Bxrk - Fallen bro he is a fucking child
Jamie_ - JexUK did you just say I have been ddosing you lately? 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bxrk - JexUK its not harmful
Fallen - Bxrk In my opinion all of you are acting childish.
Bxrk - HAHHAH - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-03-15/1615843406-307495-image.png
JexUK - Jamie_ lately - no. Thanks for not DDoSing us it makes a change
Previously, while you worked here, you DDoSed our servers multiple times as a joke.
Bxrk -  - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-03-15/1615843463-422249-image.png
Jamie_ - JexUK yea because you said you had the best ddos protection out there
Bxrk - Jamie_ bro contabo (what you use) or velocitynode has the best ddos protection for sure man
Bxrk - i sent him screenshots of the code maybe he will understand ffs
Jamie_ - Bxrk lmao
Bxrk - lmao - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-03-15/1615843710-357418-image.png
JexUK -  - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-03-15/1615843774-536337-image.png
Bxrk - ayo jex is just ignoring me in the vc and not giving two fucks lmao
Bxrk - its because he doesnt want this python file to be executed
Bxrk - kicked me from the gc not wanting to create a serer for me lmao
Bxrk - Yep, @Jamie_  i see what you mean by the host is shit from the last winterhoax
onyx - what the fuck is this thread
eraters - there are too many of these now
Bxrk - eraters this host is £1 a gb it’s going to fail you watch
typicalGta - Fallen I'd quickly like to point out that your TOS is completely invalid.




On the whole website, nowhere it asked me for consent which is what you have to do. Since you're offering services to users states that the business is operational which means you'd need to ask for consent one way or the other regardless of the condition of your website. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-03-16/1615899241-278082-image.png

typicalGta - Jamie_ A company cannot be "In beta" it's either Operational, not out to the public yet or dissolved. A company can offer beta services to their clients but that too would be that it is in an operational state.
Jen - This thread isn't proving anything
You guys are just calling random hosts shit and bullying them
I hope this thread gets closed cause this is literally just bashing this host
There's no proof its a scam or bad
typicalGta - Jen uh... read my replies pls ❤️
Gman - Whats their discord link their site seems to have broken. lmao.
Bxrk - Gman ask oreo he’s in it i think
Jamie_ - typicalGta exactly what I said to the owner but he insisted it was beta.
luffyy - ah how i love to see this host crumble
Bxrk - luffyy yes lmao
Oreo - Gman https://discord.gg/qkfQkP7D2P
Bxrk - Oreo i got banned lmao he blocked and unblocked me like ten times
Bxrk - Jamie_ i dont get why a host would be in beta?
Bxrk - typicalGta yeah totally agree..
Bxrk - typicalGta Yep, agree with you too.
Fallen - luffyy Says the Owner of Ark Host... You don't even have a TOS or Privacy Policy.
luffyy - i sure wonder who nuked our old tos HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmm i wonder who
candy - Hey @Fallen 
I just found out that you used "Terms of Service Generator" for your Terms of Service.

https://www.termsofservicegenerator.net/



It generates the exact same:
https://www.termsofservicegenerator.net/live.php?token=vjmbRVoCdrzjPmpkwyZKdi5IKyRrAoHt

Why can't you do a TOS yourself? - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-03-17/1615956685-542383-image.png
Fallen - In my defense I did not make the TOS.
Fallen - luffyy Ain't my fault you don't have backups of your stuff.
Bxrk - Fallen lmao
Bxrk - get jex on then
Bxrk - someone add confirmed
Bxrk - https://discord.gg/qkfQkP7D2P discord
J0SH - Fallen This post is about dijxcloud, not arkhost
Bxrk - J0SH exactly
Bxrk - I just realised when i went to download their template instead of putting the acutal name they put "Dijx Cloud Copyright" instead of the actual text lmaooo and at the bottom of every .html it said ##Please do not change## Guess what? They changed it lmao
Bxrk - lmao
Bxrk - jex do you have a status page?
Bxrk - that i could look at
Bxrk - smh and also dont you guys just use the icloud logo lmao - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-03-19/1616196804-915834-image.png
Bxrk - lets goo - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-03-19/1616197094-457492-image.png
luca - Bxrk We took the site down while we make changes to our Terms.
JexUK - typicalGta Hey! Since this happened, we have done the following:
Written a proper, valid, self-made TOS going into specific detail and ensuring clarity between us and our clients.
Added a consent and cookie policy to our payment portal.
Thank you for pointing this out and thanks for being civil about it!
JexUK - Jen I appreciate this! However, we have made mistakes. I have made mistakes. We should have written a better Terms of Service. But yeah, it does kinda feel like we're basically getting harassed here for little valid reasoning. I completely get the TOS and consent stuff though, we have completely changed all of that since. New terms will be available soon.
CertifiedDog - yeah mate anytime you use template tos illegal fucker
CertifiedDog - if you swear at our support your servers will be terminated and no refund. what a scam
JexUK - CertifiedDog Abuse towards staff will result in us taking action. If you abuse our staff or services, your instance could be subject to termination. That's not a scam, that's a good business practise
JexUK - "We reserve the right to not provide support due to but not limited to, harassment or abusive comments such as swearing, if this is a continued problem your services may be terminated without refund."

"if this is a continued problem" - if you intentionally and purposely abuse our staff then yes, your service may be liable to suspension or other actions can be taken.
CertifiedDog - its a shit host anywaysss
Jamie_ - JexUK that’s your template TOS stfu
Jamie_ - nice i9-9900k servers lol, I know for certain non of them are because even your co owner said to me you didn’t and they are the same servers on that status list as when you were gonna buy a i9-9900k server LOL - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-03-28/1616925143-445189-9ff65806-1241-446d-ad1d-8c707944fac4.png
Bxrk - Jamie_ ikr
Bxrk - JexUK ye ye shut up
Sydney - CertifiedDog Don't call something a shit host bc you don't like it. Terms are terms. Don't agree to them? Fuck off and find another company to bully. They fix the important shit which should have been up to standards before release. 

As a note, I am not in any way affiliated to DijxCloud, I just don't like it when little kid bitch at nothing.

I agree they should have not released into "beta" without a proper TOS, but they fixed it. At this point, it is becoming mindless harassment
Deleted User - Your terms are not legally valid.
DijxCloud Platform is a UK-based company, and therefore will be bound by the rules and regulations of the United Kingdom.

No company exists under this name in the UK. https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/search/companies?q=DijxCloud%20Platform

You talk about an agreement, but an agreement can only exist between two or more parties, and I fail to identify the name of yours. If this is an agreement between me and nobody else, then I guess OP is right there is in fact no agreement.
Bxrk - WilliamD yk he probs copied and pasted from some other host
Bxrk - owwww, banning people for posting winterhoax link seriously...
Bxrk - @Jamie_ Jamie, istg i saw you like trial management on this host why would you do such a thing lmao

Bxrk - holy
Bxrk - this thread has 203 posts nice
PugRug - ded post xd
Jamie_ - iQuacky Pardon?
Fallen - iQuacky I’m sorry what? DijxCloud was closed and Ace had a chance at opening it. He never did. DijxCloud is gone for good. As agreed upon by Founder Jex and Dishit and myself.
AceCraft - @Jamie_ and iQuacky, First of all, I never bought Dijx cause Jex gave it to Fallen and Fallen gave it to me. I just put it to Development Mode and was customizing the Panel with Fallen. Thats all, I was planning to open Dijx when I have the money and a proper team with Quacky and Quacky btw, Why the Hell did you say I "Bought Dijx?" excuse me? 

Pardon this Dumb Kid ;-;
AceCraft - iQuacky Dude, Delete this or Edit and Fix. Man you just ruined my day ;-;
AceCraft - Fallen Indeed
iQuacky - Thoda sa galti ho gaya likh kei hua time mejn
