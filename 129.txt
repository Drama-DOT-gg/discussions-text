J0SH - Hi, Just got home to QuackHost panel VPS down, looks at VPS panel and oh no its suspended. 


Contact Ryder and first thing he says is "give me proof of payment" wait what? your ex management team gave me a free VPS, I don't have to pay?!.

I ask for my 600 server panel backup and he says: 


Like what? Why do I fall victim for your management team giving people free VPS, was I aware I was abusing ghosty.host? nope

I shouldn't have to pay for a VPS that was given to me for free by YOUR STAFF, Its not like I hacked into your fucking virtualizor innit?

I shouldn't have to be held ransom by a couple MB database file after YOUR STAFF gave ME a VPS for FREE, This is YOUR FAULT for having abusing staff, not mine. proof below


Also ghosty.host is shit anyway. I can't host a panel and two servers on it without major lag. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-11-04/1604502770-39433-image.png

J0SH - also when was i told to backup my vps?
Withdrawal - hi joshua
J0SH - btw im not arsed about the actual vps all I asked him for was the files.
Tomas - He suspended the VPS because the old management shouldn't have given it out.
J0SH - I know about that but its the refusing to give me the files or not giving me at least a days notice to backup my files, its not my fault, it was down to his own management team and now I have to pay, he's also "doing takedowns on quackhost" because of his management team @Tomas
Ryder - We are not entertaining free services and if you read then announcement we made it clear that we are suspending accounts with no billing account attached to them moreover I can have takedowns over your website for legal reasons which is not required by me to be told out.
Saqib - Mine got deleted to once, when palpatine announced their vps is shutting down and offered to transfer me to ghosty. After a few days they deleted it saying "We deleted servers that were not under ghosty.host". But its chill now, he did kinda have a point but shouldve atleast gave files.
Ryder - Thats completely irrelevent to what the thread was. When l2h vps's was said to be moved, it never meant the data. It meant the exact same specs and moreover I did not get your order so I never created them. I just did the ones who made a ticket in first place at my discord server within a day. Rest were not my duty.
Ryder -  - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-11-08/1604833491-38871-image.png
Ryder - If you read it over again, I did not get access to palps server. The thing was they offered to move to ghosty and not migration
MCKingSam - Looking at this situation, Ryder is in the right. He clearly told you to wait until Plactrix is on to review the situation. However, it's shown that you got extremely angry when you were told to wait. Your files were all still safe, yet you still got angry. If an abusive staff member gave you a free VPS, you can't expect to keep it. You're lucky that the VPS was only suspended, and not deleted fully. Also, QuackHost is terrible and you're a skid. You shouldn't be relying on a free VPS anyway.
Neon - J0SH I had the same situation. I asked for my data (JUST THE SQL DATABASE AND IF NOT THE CODE I HAD ON IT!!). But no. Jackthepug (One of my friends that worked with me on the project) offered to pay for the data. Whats that Ryder? We cant have the data if we even pay?? 
Announcements:

Now I got fucking permission to create the VPSs. I cant be asked to spend like 30 minutes scrolling thru my dms with @Plactrix and @eraters but I did get permission to make a 1gb vps and a 6gb vps. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-11-10/1605038894-746322-image.png

JackThePug - MCKingSam 

As we have stated multiple times, its not even the vps we want back, we want our files back. I was told by ryder several times that he wouldnt get my data back, Im sure he knew, that we owned the files and owned the vps. What we are angry about is the fact that he just is refusing to give our files back, he knows we owned it, there is no reason not to give us our data back...
Neon - JackThePug I agree. I never thought Id need to backup the vps before the merge and it would all be fine. Apparently I had no chance after the merge to backup the data.
Ryder - No one hosting at ghosty.host has lost their data if they have paid for the service and yeah good luck getting the data back. And you lost your data simply because you were not able to provide a invoice payment of your service(s) within the given time.
AYS - JackThePug Banned for 14 days - advertising
Ash - AYS F, what did he advertise?
Deleted User - Ash F, what did he advertise?



Read that OwO - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-11-11/1605074068-267631-uawyorjv.png
Deleted User - I think that's probably it, kthxbai
Ash - kk
Ryder - @AYS read it over and take actions over this thread not gonna respond every message.

Everything in short &gt;
We suspended user(s) which had service with us without paying anything, moreover given enough time to pay for the usage or provide a proof of payment. Since they did not - they get suspended. Just as said in announcement made on 27th October 2020.


Moreover we have rights to suspend any service(s) if required to. Read our terms, policies and rights at https://ghosty.host/tos.pdf (Section 1) - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-11-11/1605074812-348883-image.png
Ryder - And another thing which I forgot to tell @J0SH, @JackThePug @Neon . You wont be able to purchase or use any services from https://ghosty.host (Suspended, Unsuspending time is never). If found we will be obliged to take actions against you.
J0SH - i didnt do anything wrong though
J0SH - it was your fault for merging with hye, not mine, im not liable for your bullshit
J0SH - why does mckingsam just hate me tho lmao
J0SH - he joined quackhost when it had 50 members and he's still judging it from that
