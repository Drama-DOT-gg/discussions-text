IoNetty - First, I got muted and almost banned for asking for an ip. They are reselling a web host, most likely quackweb. There isn't a problem with that at all. I don't have the screenshots of me asking for an ip but here you go. There also using a freenom domain.

FatGrizzly - Heya, i‚Äôm Faisal! I'm 13 and I've been making websites, bots, software, games, and more since I was 6!

13 year old on hosting?
WHAT
IoNetty - FatGrizzly Just old enough to be on discord.
dchu096 - asking for a IP and get banned...... üòë what the... plus how do they even use carl bot without knowing their prefix.
IoNetty - dchu096 I got staff for 5 minutes earlier.
FatGrizzly - dchu096 don't be dumb, its the new trend, add 100+ bots and use only 1 one of them.
lol jk
IoNetty - FatGrizzly üòÜ
SourCream - Lol
idreesrahman - YO CHILL
MAYBE NOT TELL SOMEONE THERE IP?
idreesrahman - ALSO COME HERE AND ASK FOR STAFF RIGHT AWAY ?? LIKE DANG BRO SLOW DOWN
idreesrahman - dchu096 MB XD
IoNetty - idreesrahman What? I made an application, I was accepted too. Also, I asked for a web hosting ip. If I signed up and pinged my domain I would get it anyway. Your pretty funny.
Kowone - idreesrahman heh, stupidity beyond imagination. like dude, don't bother make a hosting if you don't want people to know the ip ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Kowone - they probably refused to show the receipt of the giftcard cuz they don't have one
comfyy - lmao, he also advertised a lot in General chat
comfyy - and they also sell web hosting from Woocommerce, idk if thats possible.
FatGrizzly - comfyy its atleast better than boxbilling
comfyy - FatGrizzly lmao
Sydney - idreesrahman The absolute stupidity.... Someone can easily find the IP of any website. They can come to you, and ask (takes longer), or google domain to IP and have their answer in seconds. 

*Unless you use CloudFlare, but that is a whole other can of worms
FatGrizzly - Sydney Unless you use CloudFlare, but that is a whole other can of worms

i can find ips behind Cloudflare lol
Tomas - FatGrizzly BoxBilling likely works better for automating a billing system than WooCommerce
Scripted - FatGrizzly find mine its on a domain proxied with cf
IoNetty - They asked me to delete the thread. And they still won't provide receipts. I was also blocked by the owner. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-25/1629929952-296515-image.png

FatGrizzly - Scripted send domain in dms
XInterverse - IoNetty It is possible that he was given the Amazon gift cards from a 3rd party (an earn and redeem site for example).
I briefly remember him giving a  Google Play gift card as well. Refusing to show or not having a receipt does not necessarily mean it's stolen.
FatGrizzly - XInterverse atleast provide proof for getting from a 3rd party source
XInterverse - FatGrizzly I will post the screenshot I recieved from him but the point is that @IoNetty should've create a thread with evidence, not assumption.


This is the screenshot I received from him



This is what he told me in my DMs - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-26/1629995072-1229-image.png

comfyy - and, if he can provide 50$ Amazon Gift Card, Why not just get a paid domain?!?!?
comfyy - XInterverse Refusing to show or not having a receipt does not necessarily mean it's stolen.

but its heavily sus tho
IoNetty - comfyy there probably fraud, straight honest.
FatGrizzly - IoNetty 

He says he has (250$)5x 50$ giftcards, tbh he should be able to buy a domain name, nice servers etc.

I just feel like Io.netty is correct in here, even tho he got it from a 3rd party source, its probably fraud.

And like use your brains, no one gives you 250$ for free for just a partnership - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-27/1630023949-880561-image.png
IoNetty - FatGrizzly he should be running off a nice buyvm or nexusbytes vps in that case, not reselling crystal which resells quackweb. a nice nexusbytes vps with good specs is 12 usd, can't beat it
comfyy - FatGrizzly ikr
comfyy - IoNetty not reselling crystal which resells quackweb.

afaik, he got it for free
XInterverse - comfyy if he can provide 50$ Amazon Gift Card, Why not just get a paid domain?!?!?

FatGrizzly He says he has (250$)5x 50$ giftcards, tbh he should be able to buy a domain name, nice servers etc.

Can you buy a domain with Amazon gift cards?

comfyy its heavily sus tho

Possibly, but there is evidence now so we know he didn't steal it.

FatGrizzly And like use your brains, no one gives you 250$ for free for just a partnership

You don't know the links or status of the partner, if they have connections to other partners etc. It's possible.
FatGrizzly - XInterverse You don't know the links or status of the partner

technically we both are partners. send me a 1000 bucks, also I told many times he is illegal to use Amazon
XInterverse - FatGrizzly I mean how strong the link is between him and his partner and whoever supplies his partner.

FatGrizzly he is illegal to use Amazon

Isn't that why he's giving them away? ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
He got Amazon gift cards, he's giving it away - not using it.
FatGrizzly - XInterverse I mean how strong the link is between him and his partner and whoever supplies his partner.

our partnership isn't strong? ü§ù
XInterverse - FatGrizzly Faisal and the partner who is supplying the giftcards. Their partnership.
FatGrizzly - XInterverse I'm partners with Cloudflare for 3+ months, they don't give my anything üò≠ 

i mean dude he is a 13 yo kid(no offense to any 13 old), he can't be just getting a 5x 50$ cards. ok let's say that he really got it, ask his partner to provide proof of purchase
XInterverse - FatGrizzly I'm partners with Cloudflare for 3+ months, they don't give my anything üò≠

Your not partnered with Cloudflare. Even if you were, the strength of the partnership between you and Cloudflare would be very low, whereas we don't know the strength of the partnership between him and his supplier.

FatGrizzly i mean dude he is a 13 yo kid

Your not that far behind, a bit jealous?
Also he did say he uses his parent's bank account so they would know.

FatGrizzly ask his partner to provide proof of purchase

Perhaps you could ask, but if it were me I'd say that's a bit too internal.
comfyy - XInterverse partnership between him and his supplier

I mean, he's getting it in a shady way.

XInterverse (an earn and redeem site for example).

I am assuming and correct me if I'm wrong, its a site where you can review a product and get paid for it?
comfyy - bump
Trxppy - Kowone  if someone asked me for a receipt i wouldnt send em a pic either tf
if they dont believe that its real then fuck em bru
stfu
Trxppy - FatGrizzly i had like $300 bucks in cash from savin up when i was 13 bru stfu
Kowone - Trxppy even if it's real, with no evidence provided to support their shit about them purchasing the item, we can't say they purchased them, it might be stolen üòÜ
Trxppy - comfyy sus is different u fuckin dumbass
im sus you shitty mf
Trxppy - Kowone yeah
it being stolen is the only conclusion to go to just bc they refuse to post a fuckin receipt to some sussy bitch on the internet
Trxppy - comfyy if he aint want it then he aint want it you fuckin dumb stupid bitch
Trxppy - Kowone  if you aint want it then shut the hell up and go fuck wit someone else you dick
Trxppy - @FatGrizzly caught yo ass in 4k bitch
those dicks from the monkey's that fucked yo moma? - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-09-12/1631422084-327010-image.png
FatGrizzly - Trxppy fine, have some https://foxomy.com/billing/admin
Kowone - Trxppy don't you have a dick? oh, sorry, you're not a human. my bad
Pydro - Faisal is the best! He responds to me every time when I want a domain, bot , and a website. #Dango4Life
Aaron_ - Pydro Good4you
babyharpseal - Pydro Faisal's alt detected
