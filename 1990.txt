Moony - So their is this guy named "Booji" and he has this discord server called "Booji's buyers" and what they basically do is sell reduced doordash prices and sell nuke bots and apparently do Cash Flips, now this guy has this whole channel dedicated to proofs and it looks like every person in the server is happy with him, so I just wanted to test if he was a scammer or not so I did cash flip because I dont feel safe giving this random dude my Address, and so I said if I cash app you $5 how much will you give? He said "I will give $10" it seemed legit  enough so I tried it and he shortly starting spamming the N word and calling me a idiot and blocked me and banned me from his server.

Update: His server got banned for violating ToS but he made a new server with all members back in the server including me and he unblocked me, so I DM'd him asking for my $5 back and he kept saying "Who are you??". 

Hopefully the lesson I can teach you: "If its too good to be true it probably is"
Aplimmm - Moony where is the proof lol
Moony - Aplimmm I dont know if I cant find the proof since he blocked me and banned me but I could try
