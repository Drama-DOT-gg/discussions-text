J0SH - They're getting 3TB/s ddos protection apparently
J0SH - Also the owner said he banned JAY for trying to ghost ping everyone,  I was with him in the discord server and he did not ghost ping
J0SH - Got banned just then, last message he said was get my own business right, even though he doesn't know I own a host 5x the size of his which is 100% legal.

Told me that "promoting nulled software isn't that legal" lol I was telling his clients he nulled whmcs and posted https://whmcs.com/members/verifydomain.php
JAY - luffy the clip there where I was trying to get answers then they just ban me out of no where
NotII - corehosting.nl has nulled whmcs, they proceeded to ban me after asking about the nulled license they admitted to using a nulled whmcs 

there defence fo - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-11-18/1605722696-660152-image0-1.png
NotII - didn't mean to press post, but there defense was, they were working on their new site
NotII - They just bought the whmcs license

Shiv - Not sure about before, but he's got it authorized now

(Note: Not trying to protect them, they are pretty sketch) - https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/719998403446177863/779767942341591060/unknown.png
Shiv - NotII guessing he didn't buy a license, probably just got the domain verified and is still working with nulled whmcs. People like them never change
luffy - The reason they have the nulled software is because one of their old  management installed it when he had acess they didnt use it at all
luffy - When i had made a fuss about it one of their owners streamed to me and had bought the whmcw license
luffy - I can confirm that they arent using any nulled software and everything is using their own hardware as i saw their datacentre
Kurkentrekker - Shiv Uhmm, yeah were pretty sketchy.

Offering good servers for a small price is hard to believe i know,

But thoose people were just idk, let them be something.
Like in the tagg: SCAMMERS, ILLEGAL ACTIVITY, BAD SERVICES

All tose things are just lied, all of our customers are real.
We have our own dedicateds in the datacenter and that kind of stuff.
Bear - luffy

WockySlush - They are still using a nulled WHMCS license.
