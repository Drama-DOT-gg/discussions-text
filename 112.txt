xCrystalz_ - SlayHost, the original version of 'ByteSyze'. Did infact use PAID nodes. Proof of this can be shown by the Founder of SlayHost, SlayorPlayz. We then partnered with ByteSyze and SeekX promised he would buy things for ByteSyze however FORCED Owner, SlayorPlayz to buy EVERYTHING! SeekX ALSO demoted Staff (like me) without permission from Slayor and would ban and punish us from the discord. He would also swear (breaking our own rules WHICH HE CREATED) and would also pretend we did things bad to make it look like we do illegal activity. EVEN THOUGH WE DONT! Although ByteSyze isn't a thing anymore or SlayHost. I felt it was right to say that SeekX, AKA PteroX is a scammer and tries to make people look bad when they do nothing wrong.
