Jacob - I don't usually involve myself in drama but Asharib shouldn't run a host.

So theres this person called Asharib whos an owner of a host called Nixxon Nodes.

Here is some images showing how unprofessional he is:

Jacob - Just realised their website copied the MinerServer Terms Of Service.
https://minerserver.host/terms
https://nixxon.xyz/tos/ (https://web.archive.org/web/20210828054042/https://nixxon.xyz/tos/ if it gets deleted)

Jacob - You also can't read their privacy policy in one part. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-28/1630129661-609573-image.png

Aaron_ - Jacob The Same Thing For Their Main Page. Told Me They Are Fixing It, Been Like 2 Days Since Then. Curious To See What Happens Next.
Aaron_ - Jacob AceHost/ExoticNodes Had The Same ToS I Think..
Jacob - Aaron_ 

They banned saptarshi for telling them their website was broken.
signyboi - Aaron_ Yeah, im pretty sure Acehosting stole Minerservers ToS
Aaron_ - Jacob Professionalism At Its Peak
Jacob - @Aaron_ sent me some screenshots.





They banned @Aaron_ then purged the chat so it looked like it never happened. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-28/1630133888-218354-image.png

signyboi - Jacob 
"4 time swear" - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-28/1630134198-302604-image.png
Vamp_ - Aaron_ Fyi, privacy policy and tos of both ace and exotic was done by @Jacob himself, you can ask him
Vamp_ - Alting lol, and alting is against our rules and tos soo that defines your ban in detail - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-28/1630138952-208631-image.png
signyboi - Vamp_ this happened after the false ban.
Jacob - Vamp_ What about sped's ban?
signyboi - Vamp_ Jacob never gave you permission to use it on Nixxon though.
Vamp_ - signyboi It was generated online, what permission do I require to use it, and it was modified btw, right after all drama happened on ace
Vamp_ - And Asharib doesn't want other Minerserver's staff team to be in here so what can I do about it, like I said, we follow and respect each other's decisions
signyboi - Vamp_ We modified it as well, just because it was generated online doesn't mean you can steal someone's privacy policy. Just to clear things up about the generated privacy policy, we have changed it now.
Jacob - Vamp_ Pretty unprofessional to ban someone just because they are in a server.
signyboi - Vamp_  Just because you don't like someone doesn't mean you can ban them from your services.
Vamp_ - signyboi Lmao, have you even read our privacy policy? Ask jacob who suggested him to use termly.io's generator, lit no1 here copied your priv policy
signyboi - Vamp_ Sorry for the mistake *ToS
Vamp_ - signyboi Yeah right, minerserver staff join the server and opens a ticket to see if we are lying about our nodes, thats toally normal according to you yeah? There is lit a separate channel for our nodes details and stuff and still your staff wanted to view the specs directly from our vps
Vamp_ - signyboi And that, was modified, not just directly copied, so it can even be considered that I generated it from the same website which jacob used to make his, Jacob and you do not own that tos or something to point it out, you too have generated it, we used it while modifying it according to how we wanted it to be
signyboi - Vamp_ Who asked for this? Also just because one staff member did something bad doesn't mean you should go around banning everyone in the Minerserver staff team
Vamp_ - signyboi Last time we saw in exotic, Meab (Miner server's official owner) swore in server's general chat, when the owner itself is capable of doing those stuff, how can we be soo sure that the same owner who has hired you as staff won't be doing the same?
Chirag - Vamp_ swore

you're joking right? omg, he said a swear word, I'll never use minerserver again omg
Vamp_ - Chirag Fyi, we do not allow swearing here in Nixxon, we don't want our environment to be TOXIC, we want to keep it friendly for all members who use our services
Jacob - Vamp_ 
Remember ace/exotic? - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-28/1630140829-607706-image.png
Aaron_ - Vamp_ What's Bad In That? If A User Wants To View Them You Are Bound To Show Them. Or Else Don't Moderate A Server.
Jacob - Vamp_ 

we don't want our environment to be TOXIC - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-28/1630140967-910613-image.png
Chirag - Jacob That shit head is me btw ^ - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-28/1630140956-763245-screenshot-2021-08-28-14-25-21-36-572064f74bd5f9fa804b05334aa4f912.jpg

Vamp_ - Jacob This host has no connection to ace except that we both own nixxon btw, as we follow all chirag's and multi egg's rules, we use a proper paid domain, have a valid privacy policy and tos, privacy policy and tos are in website itself. And yes I do know tos and privacy policy is not so visible at the moment, but we have promised to get it fixed in the following week
Jacob - Vamp_ It does since it was owned by both of you
Aaron_ - Vamp_ So You Mean Good Customer Service Doesn't Matter To Asharib Aka The Owner Of A Host Nearly As Big As Jacobs?
Jacob - Chirag "can you develop my host" lol
Chirag - Jacob yes, it veri ez, me do rm -rf / --no-preserve-root and it work
Aaron_ - Chirag u mai god!! so ez plz donate nodes i want to make hosting companies!!
Vamp_ - Jacob Noob thing was just a joke chill, he swore!!
Chirag - Vamp_ and what's the big deal if someone swore?
Jacob - Vamp_ Still quite unprofessional and swearing should be a warn/mute lol
Jacob - Aaron_ ssh root@127.0.0.1 no scam
Vamp_ - Aaron_ You guys are not exactly CUSTOMERS, you just joined to point out faults and other stuff in our host, and we without good customer service would we be this transparent to everyone?
Vamp_ - Chirag Told ya, we wanna keep it a safe environment for everyone
Aaron_ - Vamp_ Where Was His Warn?
Jacob - Vamp_ Still, not even a mute/warn.
Vamp_ - Jacob Thats decided by us owners
Aaron_ - Vamp_ So You Mean Some Moderator From Another Host Is Not A Customer?
Vamp_ - Aaron_ No, YOU are not a customer
Aaron_ - Vamp_ The Owner Mentioned 4 Warns = A Ban But I Can't See Any Warns. That's Not Fair In Any Way Nor Cool.
Aaron_ - Vamp_ What Makes Me Different From Customers?
Aaron_ - If I Donate You 3 Nodes Then I Am?
Vamp_ - Jacob Thats decided by us mate, we decide what happens to each individual
Asharib - 4 warn = ban and he did swear 4 times
https://asharib.is-a-cool-femboy.xyz/58mF8Ojo5
Vamp_ - Aaron_ No
Jacob - Asharib He swore ONCE and not even a warning or mute
Vamp_ - Aaron_ That applied if he swore just in general referring to a customer/in general, your team swore directly at the owner, how do you expect us to tolerate it
Jacob - Vamp_ He was never warned, it was just a direct ban.
Vamp_ - Jacob By violating the rules of a host, you do not exactly get to question us
Asharib - Jacob he meant to spam that 
https://asharib.is-a-cool-femboy.xyz/58mG6MzNf
Jacob - Vamp_ I never violated any of your rules.
Vamp_ - Jacob Dude, even the constitution has the rights to modify the rules depending upon the case, we can ban/mute/warn or do whatever to the individual, its depending upon our decision what happens to rule breakers
Vamp_ - Jacob Double counter banned you lol
Jacob - Vamp_ Yes, double counter thinks my main account is an alt as I used an alt on minerserver to test the client panel so now it thinks my alt account is my main.
SPED - no warn because the owners are scared of the truth
Aaron_ - Vamp_ So You Mean You And Asharib Are Gonna Show Temper On Users?
Aaron_ - I Still Don't Understand Why Am I Being Excluded From The Users Category. Ask Question About The VPS = Fuck Off?
Asharib - Aaron_ You were our user ? I don't think so because you were just to spread toxicty
Jacob - Screenshots from Meab#3333 - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-28/1630142341-757186-image.png

Jacob - Asharib Asking for proof of VPS specs is "toxicity" now?
Aaron_ - Asharib Oh My! What Did I Send Master?
Aaron_ - I Have The Whole Transcript Of The Ticket If Necessary, I Was Never Toxic.
Vamp_ - Aaron_ We too keep transcripts of tickets, when have we ever been toxic to our REAL CUSTOMERS, we tend to use our services than point out our mistakes
Aaron_ - Vamp_ Have I Ever Pointed Out Any Mistakes Or Even Spammed Anything?
Aaron_ - If You Are Talking About My Ticket Asking For Proofs Of The VPS Specifications Then I Don't See How It Is Toxicity
Jacob - Vamp_ Quick question, why was Saptarshi banned for telling you about your website issues.



He opened a ticket to tell you about these issues then you just banned him. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-28/1630142815-965205-image.png

Vamp_ - Aaron_ Like I said, its the owner's decision, he doesn't want you to use our services, you can't
Aaron_ - Vamp_ Why Have Tickets Then If The Owner Doesn't Care About Anything About User Satisfaction? Why Do You Guys Run A Host Then?
Vamp_ - Jacob Dude, we told that he won't allow minerserver team in, doesn't mean he was banned for telling about the website, and for the 3rd time, we know about the site alri? Its being worked on
Aaron_ - Vamp_ How Are They Harming lmao
Jacob - Vamp_ Then why didn't you let him know you would fix it instead of banning him for giving your feedback.
Vamp_ - Aaron_ We do care about customer satisfaction, who told we did not, you were most probably here to just find a fault in our system
Aaron_ - Your Customer Service Is Ass @Asharib
Aaron_ - Vamp_ I Was There To Make Sure That Everything Is Cool So That I Could Try The Host Out. Ofcourse I Won't If You Guys Would Act Like Childrens
Asharib - Jacob Cool feedback ? https://asharib.is-a-cool-femboy.xyz/58mLSGCLp
Vamp_ - https://asharib.is-a-cool-femboy.xyz/58mLSGCLp To give a proper feedback, we do expect some respect for the work we do alri, what will you do if some random guy joins your server and be like, this is trash?
Jacob - Asharib 
you can barley even click the button - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-28/1630143274-832591-image.png
Jacob - Vamp_ We would ask then what is wrong with it and see if they  have any feedback.
SPED - At least we have a smart staff team that know how to make a website
Aaron_ - Vamp_ Feedbacks Don't Have To Be Good All The Time.
Vamp_ - Jacob For the 4th time, website is getting fixed alri?
Aaron_ - Asharib Just Because Its A Bad Comment To Your Host You Will Ban Him? LOL?
Asharib - What about this ?
https://asharib.is-a-cool-femboy.xyz/58mMEWPso
Aaron_ - Vamp_ Why Didn't You Guys Tell That To Sap In The First Place? What's With Banning?
Aaron_ - Asharib Its A Bad Comment, I Don't See Anything Else. Doesn't Trigger Anger In Me To Ban Them
Vamp_ - Jacob When we do know whats wrong about it, why would we ask them? My devs are fixing it as we speak, doesn't mean your staff can call it trash, sap was toxic from before even during exotic btw
Triassic - Tf is going on here
Vamp_ - Aaron_ All sap does is take credit for the website he made for minerserver and show off that his website and his skills are the best out there, we would listen if we would get a tiny bit of respect
Triassic - SPED dang
SPED - Triassic We are trying to make a point on why i got banned for no reason some shit has gone down
Jacob - Vamp_ You could have atleast said something like this:
"Our devs are currently working on fixing this."
Jacob - SPED No, just how they are unprofessional.
Vamp_ - SPED Nice and well civilised staff here @Jacob
Aaron_ - Vamp_ So You Mean Bad Customer = Bad Behaviour?
SPED - Vamp_ thats a good thing he has all the credit and disserves it
Vamp_ - Jacob He could have atleast said " Your website seems to be broken and un-usable, fix it"
SPED - Vamp_ thank you
Jacob - Vamp_ Your other owner literally swore at customers and acts unprofessional
Jacob - Vamp_ That still shouldn't result in a ban. You could have asked about it.
Aaron_ - Vamp_ While The Owner Acts All Childish?
Vamp_ - Website is fixed btw, tell it to your SAP - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-28/1630143733-844727-image.png
Vamp_ - Jacob Thats our decision again, we own this, we decide which toxic member gets a ban
Jacob - Vamp_ 
It's not fixed. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-28/1630143844-153716-image.png
Vamp_ - Jacob Ctrl+F5
Jacob - Vamp_ Already did.
Vamp_ - And if you wanna point out privacy policy page once again, we are re-scaling it
Vamp_ - Jacob Zoom out dude
Jacob - Vamp_ You shouldn't need to zoom out for a website to work.
Asharib - https://asharib.is-a-cool-femboy.xyz/58mPrFHZ0
Vamp_ - Jacob Are you even reading the posts? I told we are re-sizing it right?
Jacob - Asharib You zoomed in fully, this is what your site looks like if I do that - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-28/1630144097-768302-image.png
Jacob - Vamp_ You just said it was fixed.
Vamp_ - Jacob What are we playing with zoom rn?
Vamp_ - Jacob 

Vamp_ ...
Jacob - Vamp_ I was talking about the main page not the privacy policy page.
Vamp_ - Jacob Main page is fixed.... I can view it properly
Vamp_ - Drama done? May i leave right now?
signyboi - Vamp_ Staff members from other hosts arent real customers?
signyboi - Vamp_ Terrible reason.
Jacob - Vamp_ Just because it works for you doesn't mean it works for everyone else. People have different screen sizes.
Vamp_ - Website is fixed btw
Aaron_ - Vamp_ Ok - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-09-03/1630652248-836206-image.png
Aaron_ - Still Can't Access It.
Aaron_ - Guess I Will Never Be Able To Access It. 🤷‍♂️

Jacob - Aaron_ it's probably shutting down again - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-09-06/1630928391-625478-screenshot-20210906-210819-discord.jpg

Jacob - Jacob nevermind we got banned somehow
Aaron_ - Jacob Cringe, They Pinged Users Like A Million Times.
Two - Aaron_ Can People Who Talk Like This Be Gone?
Aaron_ - Two Maybe Not

Asharib - Jacob Welp I D C we just gonna leak
 900+ people data if sagnik dosent stops
Aaron_ - Asharib There You Go! The Classic Asharib
Jacob - Asharib So your gonna commit a crime over an ownership argument?
potatobrickz - Asharib wat
Asharib - Jacob I still have owner ship of Real nixxon
Jacob - Asharib That doesn't mean you can leak people's data.
potatobrickz - Asharib thats illegal
Asharib - potatobrickz Welp the new fake Nixxon Owner dosen't cares about users data https://asharib.hates-you.xyz/kt9uxflhi9a
Jacob -  - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-09-07/1631006247-678541-image.png
potatobrickz - Asharib its not nixxon anymore
signyboi - Asharib If you leak Nixxon data you would be commiting a crime while also ruining your reputation.
potatobrickz - signyboi yes
gavinx2031 - Asharib That doesnt excuse you lol your treating to leak PERSONAL info on ppl over petty drama like this... This is EXTREMELY unprofessional and not how u should handle things. DON'T bring innocent users into this.
Asharib - gavinx2031 Oh so that raid ping @everyone was that legal?
potatobrickz - gavinx2031 yes very unprofessional
Jacob - Asharib Raids are not illegal but against discord's TOS. That can get your discord account banned, however leaking data is illegal.
signyboi - Asharib Yes lmao, how tf do you think that was against the law?
Asharib - signyboi They betrayed us now prob revenge is smthng
signyboi - Asharib You can get revenge without breaking the law and leaking innocent peoples data.
Asharib - signyboi oh really how?
signyboi - Asharib Find another way, its not up to me.
gavinx2031 - Asharib lol its illegal to leak innocents people data just dont bring innocent ppl into the mix lol
Asharib - gavinx2031 LOL Ok
signyboi - hm - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-09-07/1631007735-415519-image.png
Aaron_ - Jacob Both Are Acting Like Kids Now
Aaron_ - Asharib Yes, It's 100% Legal. Comparing To What You Want To Do.
Aaron_ - signyboi Vamp And Asharib Both Need Help
signyboi - Aaron_ Mhm, unlike what Asharib over here is doing.
Triassic - What's going on here
signyboi - Aaron_ If you are at the point of threatening to leak peoples personal information, then yes I agree.
Aaron_ - He Is Not Unprofessional Anymore, He Is Being A Idiot At This Point
Jacob - Triassic The 3 owners had an argument and now vamp and ashirab are threatening to leak data over host ownership
Aaron_ - signyboi I Can't Even Imagine Leaking Personal Information Just Because Of That
Aaron_ - Jacob Argument Over What Really? I Don't Understand Them At All.
Aaron_ - All Of These Start With Ash Acting Childish, Right?
Triassic - Jacob do they have a discord server?
gavinx2031 - Aaron_ I got no clue lol i've talked with vamp he said he wasnt going to leak it but knowing vamp he might

(Edit) Going forward i would not trust any products they  make
Jacob - Triassic They only have their old server they got banned from the new one https://discord.gg/jMezWZk that's their old one.
Jacob - Aaron_ Something about ownership or something dumb like that
Triassic - Oh this big bad vampire guy wanted to "legally" steal Idley.gg's logo a while ago, he added us to a groupchat with his friend and they tried to convince me that I do not own the Idley logo, even though that's bullshit.
Aaron_ - Triassic Just Checked Out Idley.gg, Your Statement Seems Valid To Me. I Have Seen Your Logo On Jacob's Server Which Was Sent By Vamp I Think.
Triassic - Aaron_ Yeah they're idiots.
Aaron_ - Jacob The Last Time He Got Into Drama Was Also Because Of That Same Reason Right?
Jacob - Aaron_ Nah it was about something else other than ownership.
Aaron_ - Jacob I Remember It Incorrectly Then, Rip
Aaron_ - He Even Created A Thread Named "What to do if you don't have friends and your lonely in this world". How Depressed Our Ash Is. 😂 - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-09-07/1631032876-776996-unknown.png

Jacob - Slack does youtube botting now????? - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-09-14/1631587071-448071-image.png
signyboi - Jacob For anyone wondering Slacknodes was the continuation of Nixxon. One of Nixxons old founders (Sagnik Das#2014) helped create Slacknodes along with Ashnul, it was originally called Nixxon | NEW or something like that and then they changed the name to Slacknodes to avoid being caught up in any further drama.

Slacknodes invite: https://discord.gg/wtjd99j2

hampter - signyboi just to proceed the drama. I was banned for not accepting to pay their nodes. They were saying that they have around 100k Dollars but need money to buy Hetzner Auction Servers..

I think theres a new host again that the new owner and sagnik are running, It's stupid what they are doing. I don't care about them but that's the information I can tell.
hampter - Im also banned on the continuation of SlackNodes and stuff
signyboi - hampter 100k dollars 🤣
Aaron_ - signyboi Nah mate don't laugh he got 100k USD we need to respect him
Aaron_ - @hampter Can we talk on discord if you don't mind? I would like to ask some questions. My tag: Aaron_#8724

Tato - Noticeably, they seem to have used a bot to send the link to their "web hosting" in the entire server of normal hosting they were going to run. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-11-10/1636563337-897720-image.png

I have highlighted words/parts that could've been worded better / differently (and should have been). - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-11-10/1636563452-898020-image.png
Tato - Seemingly main hosting is closed down, don't know if this applies to their web hosting. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-11-10/1636563596-793680-image.png
