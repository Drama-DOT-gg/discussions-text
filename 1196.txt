DeadBush - See if you purchase some shit on a host without tos and pp and they take ur code and wipe your server. You can make a host being scam but please don't blame them for stealing codes and shit because they already don't have legal docs and it's you being dum ass using their services. I won't say it's completely your fault but more than half it is.
So please don't spam threads.
If anyone wanna add more please reply to this post
