Tomas - What do you expect? You are trying to run a server on 1GB of RAM
Ryan - first of all , send of proof cause we're not rude in the tickets, second of all we dont use velocity vpss, de1 from contabo , de2 from hetzner , donor from malzli,  
I dont have a comment on the bad tps, and about the hetzner cracking subject we were just talking about it, it doesnt mean we are doing , you're not getting demoted but correct your facts please , and send the proof you have
ItsAceCraft - Tomas Run 1gb ram server on falix my guy and look its tps. I am talking about FalixNodes that has so many Customers but still no were near the same tps...
ItsAceCraft - Ryan Can't really say Much on the staff thing cuz the ticked was deleted so no ss.
Ryan - kept avoiding to send proof, the photo you see above is because no one is in the server
we use a plugin (hibernate) so when no one is in the server it uses less ram and cpu, if he gets on the server the tps will get better + he's using 1gb ram and only 80% to run 1.16 server i admit he won't get the best tps but we're always trying to upgrade , and we're upgrading our ryzen 5 node soon, he doesnt have proof for anything else he said. one guy we kept deleting his tickets is a guy called MySmileGuy he opened a ticket asking for owner, he kept begging we closed the ticket and he made another ticket just to show us his drama.gg thread about our spelling mistakes, 
and itsAceCraft about not getting demoted we will probebly consider demoting you we don't mind getting hoaxed but liars amon our staff members is not acceptable - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-22/1621690554-851187-image.png

Ryan - ItsAceCraft give me another case besides MySmileGuy and i will go live in drama.gg discord server and show transcipts live
Ryan - if anyone wants invoices for the vpss let us know
ItsAceCraft - Ryan As I said Earlier, I Can't really Argue about the Staff team as the Ticket got deleted. But I did see it in my own eyes. But most shocking is the tps. Even 17 tps is considered is Very Bad but 1 not acceptable...
ItsAceCraft - Ryan I do agree on the Staff and VPS thing and I corrected it. But The tps...

ItsAceCraft - Ryan Even  if you don't buy from Velocity Anymore What About the Performance?
Ryan - ItsAceCraft you avoding my answers maybe deleting the thread or
 admitting your wrong is better
ItsAceCraft - Now After speaking to some of the ceo's The tps is low because of hibernation. Once players Are active for liek 5 - 10 mins it gets above 17 tps which is still playable. Thank God I was proven wrong or I would really sad for CatServices. Sorry for the trouble. But Now i hope if someone faces a bad performance as me if you make a server in Cat Services then its cause if this. 

Again:
Sorry for the inconvenience and sorry for deciding things too fast.
typicalGta - ItsAceCraft lmao you got clowned you just want fame ey?
