Jen - Imagine crying over $6 - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-02-24/1614134771-342012-image.png
Jen - Me and my lawyer have been talking and they are actually illegally extorting me and i am a minor
thats punishable in USA and they are in the USA
Two - I really feel like you hid some messages to make yourself look better.

The first screenshot is from 8:27PM-8:28PM, but the second one is from 8:36PM-8:38PM, and that "reply message" for the second screenshot shows that you are hiding messages.
Two - Jen If you are a minor, you shouldn't even be legally allowed to have paypal or whatever you used to order stuff at sparked host too, meaning that you'd be punished too.
Two - Also, I'm pretty sure you are the same person who tried to winterhoax Contabo.
Jen - Two lmfao i don't own a paypal dumbass
Jen - Two no that wasn't me mate i love contabo
eraters - what about that galactic host one you sent me money with
eraters - and shows under your email
Jen - eraters its verified with my documents mate
eraters -  - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-02-24/1614172162-45667-image.png
Jen - We are 100% Safe because they are not trademarked so they can't sue me for a domain - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-02-24/1614201274-116253-image.png
NighMayHigh - LMAOOOO did you buy a sparked host domain,

sue their asses over it, they are taking your data, that is a simple case of extortion, because that's legal right?____
Jen - NighMayHigh I can sue them because they are not legally allowed to keep my data hostage until i give them the domain, On top of it if they register a trademark its too late sense the domain is now registered before their trademark
Jen - What  is they gonna do now - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-03-01/1614610803-44368-image.png
AnthonyM - Let me just real quick close this topic and make it more of, a good answer on such situation from past experience.

When something is kept private, don't start your first move and make yourself a clown, that's a bad reputation to come at first, when you get asked a question, don't avoid it, answer it, we want everyone to know what's up with this.

I felt people were taking this too much serious, while I was laughing in the background on Jen, yes Jen not Sparked Host.

Let's start with you Jen, usually a green color at sparked means you're a partner, it's a shame they accepted you at first.
Not only did you violate their ToS, but also made it public and hiding messages ( Credit @Two )

(image from: https://sparkedhost.com/terms-of-service.php#Copyrightandtrademarknotices)

You've went aggressive at someone when they asked you a few questions to clear up a few things, I'll give you this and make you not guilty yet, even though this pretty much makes you guilty with what I sent before.


(image from: https://drama.gg/d/221-sparked-host/4)

Let me finish you now, and hold you up from your dirty moves:
Being underage (according to what you responded) and according to you, you do not own your paypal but verified it with your own documentation and you use it..? I'm sorry, but like that's the exact definition of using paypal and being underage, anyhow, let's go back to where you said they were verified, a winterhoax moderator confirms that your paypal in not verified, please explain- oh wait you didn't want to respond due to you being unable to do so, bet you'll even tell me to stfu or even ignore this, which is fair, however, notice that if you're going in a legal court, you'll lose.


(image from: https://drama.gg/d/221-sparked-host/12)

Now if you don't mind, kindly go back to studying, go back to reviewing how legal things work, be more mature, answer every possible question, then afterwards think if you wish to publish stuff like those, I don't want you to make people believe Sparked Host LLC is a "bad" company or an "illegal" company while you're illegally having a paypal and lied that it's verified &amp; ignored the case.

For the rest, I'd like you to take notes, it's not something to ignore but something to learn from, I've made mistakes in the past, and now, fixing them is the solution for those.

Also Jen, about your question what they can do now, they can take the domain if they contact your domain provider, legally they are required to give the domain, I believe they've done this to many domains in the past, so like hatred said, "For your own sake, I hope you take the deal they offered", that's again, the best answer you could get and you should be thankful to hatred.

Enjoy,

Jen - AnthonyM lmfao the funny part is
SparkedHost doesn't have a trademark they only have an LLC
My Lawyer even did some digging and an LLC can't be used as a trademark
They have 0 trademark registered any place in the fucking world
Iceey - AnthonyM You realize Sparked Host LLC illicitly voided the Copyright and Trademark Notices of the Terms of Service by falsely claiming trademark registration? They also threatened to sue under grounds which I personally debunked. 

The serious part is the suspension of a service which Heimsnet was prohibited from enforcing by their Terms of Service on account of Jen's alleged defaming of Sparked Host LLC via the domain sparkedhost.net, sparkedhost.net had nothing to do with that Heimsnet VPS. It's extortion.

DISCLAIMER: Jen has not, afaik, explicitly agreed to the terms and conditions of Sparked Host LLC and is only enforced by the Heimsnet one.
Iceey - Jen I'm not a lawyer.
Vanquish - Iceey DEAD!!! LMAOOO
AnthonyM - Jen First, before I respond, I love and it's horribly funny how you've ignored, not only half, but almost all of what I said and targeted one specific thing, clearly, you're not allegeable to any thread at first.

Second to respond, even if it's not or if it is, your actions and your behavior does not make them guilty, but makes you guilty, you're not only dealing with Sparked Host LLC but with PayPal too, will you sue them if your PayPal account got terminated and they hold your data cause you're, not only you've commit fraud in my eyes but also dare to lie.

Thank you for your understanding "TwentySix",
Anthony
AnthonyM - Iceey That's another thing to be dealt with, with appropriate people and in a good behavior, you do not come publicly attempt of stopping and being a "meme", yes, if I offend someone, I'm sorry if I'm stating the truth, and share it out loud to apparently "publicly shame a company" or whatever you would like to name it, Jen's behavior and how he corresponded with the a few messages not shared ( C Two ) claiming someone else's Paypal and with his documents while according to his messages he's underage ( C eraters ) does not make him at all allegeable to be making a thread, if someone else which understands and acknowledges these would understand that it's worth as I'm able to respond &amp; protect my statement while providing all details, at the current time, Jen is guilty. For Sparked Host LLC, this thread is not deserved or should be open at all, if someone wants to take things serious, they would understand that legal actions should've been taken or somewhat speak first to them, currently, with what you guys have in hand against Sparked Host LLC is nothing more than Jen being guilty.
About your disclaimer, I believe he acknowledge and agreed to them, unsure, however, should be followed.

To add to this, since I believe people will know me of defending Sparked Host LLC or representing them, I'm not representing currently nor am I defending Sparked Host LLC, I'm clearing out a few things that should be made.

Thank you,
Anthony.
Iceey - AnthonyM How is sparked host not guilty of extortion and breach of contract? 

There's also no mention of an Eligibility of Use clause in the Sparked Host Terms of Service, so why should Jen not be able to use Sparked? A PayPal must only be operated by a grown adult, a minor may utilize it. Jen has done nothing fraudulent in that case. How is he not eligible to make a thread? Read the COPPA, jesus.
Iceey - Jen is of the class 13 and over. He's eligible to make purchases online by the COPPA.
Iceey - The only clown or "meme" here is you Anthony.
AnthonyM - Iceey I'll respond to this since it's directly to me and offend you, Mr meme, you've went full rage mode on someone for making one mistake and replacing one thing by another, I didn't go full rage until you started saying unwanted behavior such as the r word which I don't accept or tolerate and consider it the same exact thing as the n word.
Let me more of go back to how you've been a meme and failed off from a company due to you using a way of looking at other hosts and thinking that they are able wrong, yet were not able to have your own one or be in a good one and had to back away from it, kindly look at your mistakes then consider speaking about me as I've been doing this and works.
Iceey - AnthonyM Like your former CTO I had a life to proceed with, friends, education, one day you'll experience the same, remember when you sold or whatever your destiny host or what was it? 

Your former or current boss DBoss, called me the "r" word the other day. Small world huh?

The host in question that you previously owned was operating without a legitimate privacy policy, read the GDPR. Next time respond to my statements that debunk yours, 

Thanks, 
Iceey.
AnthonyM - Iceey Do you understand the difference between being allegeable of making a thread to protect himself due to someone else's potential issues, cause according to what I can see and what I saw, your behavior, not only is terrible but also is taken out to be full mad out of a person, I did not mention COPPA anywhere and did not say he's under 13, however, according to what was said, and what I clearly did say but again you were too busy raging out and focusing on something you clearly have efficient behavior to handle so you directly want to offend someone and adapt as you're superior, let me tell you this, you're equal to everyone.
According to what he said, PayPal is operated by someone else but VERIFIED BY HIS OWN DOCUMENTS do you understand? if no, read again then read this:
When a user have a PayPal account, they expect that the document are yours, and fully yours not someone else, he could've used a PayPal by his own and verify it, anyways going back to it being verified, it's not verified at all too.

AnthonyM - Iceey Clearly, you do not read, this answers your situation:


I'll ignore the rest if this continue to be made, as I said, I'm acting professional, show some too, read, thank you. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-03-01/1614638895-104008-image.png
AnthonyM - Iceey I've answered your questions before you ever write anything, expected people to write such &amp; do much more, but didn't believe people were, unfortunately, unable to at least read simple English since I've not used Huge Terms. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-03-01/1614639182-507054-image.png
Iceey - AnthonyM I'm not mad, I'm a blunt person, welcome to the real world, no one's fucking perfect.

My behavior may not be the best but my facts got value.

Also how is a trading name "Galactic Host" supposed to tell me shit? And before you leak the full details of the payment read the GDPR, Jen has EEA citizenship.

You aren't required a verified paypal to send anything, if so, why would he able to send it?

Also regarding the huge words, I literally challenged the entire sentence with "How is sparked host not guilty of extortion and breach of contract?

I mentioned the COPPA because that's the only requirement that'd hinder anyone from dealing with Sparked and posting on winterhoax.
AnthonyM - To add to more of Iceey, situation, and this is how I'm closing this, and ending this, I don't believe you've left for your own personal life matters, but more of for stuff related to those:


And if you believe I'm seriously that easy to debunk, believe me, I know more stuff about you and anyone here, responding to this more will just lead to people being rude, unprofessional, take things not serious, and I believe you guys understand why no one from the other hosts cares about this, I'm sorry that this is coming from my mouth and representing a major of hosts, but things needs to be clear.
A legal matter should be taken into the appropriate place, such thing is not appropriate and just proves you're more wrong then them or any other hosting company.

Iceey - I'm my own self on winterhoax, couldn't care less about professionalism on winterhoax.

"And if you believe I'm seriously that easy to debunk, believe me, I know more stuff about you and anyone here"
This a threat of some sort?
AnthonyM - Iceey I'll start from the COPPA mention to above, since I believe I've responded to a lot of things from your questions.
You're not allegeable to make a thread that you cannot protect yourself, give low to no information &amp; expect people to just follow you, things like such, if needed, should be taken to "court" if anything, that's just a shame for you, learn and stop arguing on this.

For your challenging sentence, I've responded to you, kindly read my previous response, I'm not going to repeat myself.

GDPR? You're telling me to read it? Have you even seen who shared it? Kindly rethink before you type, I even gave credits, https://winterhoax.com/d/221-sparked-host/12 
For the validation thing, read what was said, you'd understand you're completely wrong, he said he said he validated it with his own document (that's 1) but it was shown that it's not valid (that's 2) and Jen completely skipped/ignored it (that's 3).

Your facts got no value at all, all you've been doing was being irresponsible and unable to provide anything at all but rely at one specific thing and being unable to read messages, I didn't say Sparked Host LLC is not fully guilty, I said how the steps are made, then feel free to call them guilty, I wouldn't be here nor will I be near you or stopping you, I believe my point was given many times but unfortunately, sometimes you have to say the same thing more than once.

I don't believe you're a blunt point ( personal opinion ), nor do I believe anyone is perfect, you're just enable to make the correct decision, and that was me a while back until I noticed my mistakes and fixed them.
Iceey - eligible* Imma respond to the rest later when I feel like it
unable*
Iceey - AnthonyM okay

So here I am to provide you an answer for your ban to clear people's doubt.
You were a customer and also have an experienced role [Which is only given if the guy is being helpful to the discord channels]
But you were not our customer anymore and used to be talking negatively about the company and send troll gifs, which makes our Experienced Role look bad. If the point was to only send memes in our chat with the experienced role, which made you being banned from our server.
You still tried using alts to keep sending memes in our chat but they couldn't care much.
If you still need help from the staff, feel free to create a ticket and get support as that's their primary and main support-providing platform.
