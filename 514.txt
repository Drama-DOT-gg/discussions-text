babyharpseal - Hello! So today I came to an interesting hosting, 'ReleHost', they are Spanish, so some of you may not understand the messages, but I'll translate a bit.

So first of all, they are using nulled WHMCS, (they are using a WHMCS theme, that's why I know it), and of course, this is what the license checker pops up: (Didn't knew it was a template, my bad.)


Also, I love the "Lorem Ipsum" on their privacy policy and the title of the Privacy Policy website: 



Also, this is their "ToS, which is in "the works" when they already started to sell services.



This is the ticket so far:

Hi, I'd like to make a question, if you are using WHMCS, then why does it pop up as not licensed? And why are you selling services w/out having a valid ToS/Privacy Policy?
We aren't using WHMCS, but we will do soon
But the webpage seems similar right? VelocityNode website? And also, I love the website title @ privacy policy website.
It's a template which is being sold at a webpage
But, you should have a valid ToS/Privacy Policy first of all in order to sell services, right?
"We are working" on it
Illegal hosting? (No response since this, I'll update thread if they respond.) - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-17/1621278632-78625-image.png

Tomas - No offence to you but this information is a little incorrect.

It's obviously not WHMCS, a quick browse through the site proves that - it's just using Hustbee, which isn't a theme that VelocityNode developed or created.
Do better research when claiming a company nulls WHMCS, they are right saying it's not WHMCS, it literally is using .html file extensions on its pages &amp; links to Sellix.
Just because another host is using a template doesn't mean they made or own it.
babyharpseal - Tomas Didn't knew about the template, sorry, but the other stuff won't make it valid, as having no ToS isn't good.
Tomas - babyharpseal It's not WHMCS either
babyharpseal - Ye ye ik that now, my bad, but the Privacy policy and tos is still a thing
Tomas - Can you link the Discord server
babyharpseal - sure, give me a sec
babyharpseal - it's in spanish but k https://discord.gg/ZTjSGa9RPA
Willypro7 - https://discord.gg/Wr35JrGpBU Invite in main website so they won't revoke it
