__SECRET__ - I am secret ex-staff member of Mc world Hosting 
I just wanna tell you how this so-called mc hosting work :
first, when they are dying they merge with the host and people like ( oxy nodes / badsk / plexed ) then leave them, and magically in just one or two days that host dies because of raid / nuking/internal disputes and this didn't happen only once but twice and one example was today that all 700 member's in hexit nodes saw and the thing is they are also an in the gang of people who beg their customers to click on ads to generate more ads revenue and claims of 99% uptime but what I have seen is 99% downtime 

and here the proof's of me getting DDoSed in mc world but the higher admin who I have pinged like 10+ times are just chilling the hexit nodes VC and playing Minecraft - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-06/1638817096-428839-ddos.png

Avocet - __SECRET__ no, it's just a complete lie to scare people about this "ip theft" they are not even taking your address just an ip which will never give you the location you are in.
Avocet - __SECRET__ and remember if you don't open the link it is worse because they look like clowns because the discord server itself opens the link just like WhatsApp.
FlyingMane - This was a huge insight in the hexit raid. Ngl we can't do much about it but this was really useful
Dubss - __SECRET__ We at MCWorld have nothing to do with you being ddosed. Your fault you clicked the IP grabber. Not ours. Stop crying.
SirCat-Qlox - maybe dont click on random links without a vpn? lol, ur fault.
