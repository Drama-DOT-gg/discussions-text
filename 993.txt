DinoTheDev - Recently NightHost has shut down its services without warning users at all. websites, panel, and nodes arent online and probably delete.
NightHost did not warn everyone about this to back-up their data.
Also, they don't have a public privacy policy available to users I had to ask one of the Developers for it.
I even have the screenshots to prove they shut down: - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-09-12/1631479018-96295-image.png
