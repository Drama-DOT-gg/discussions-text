AllSafe - Hello NotEthan,

How does they scammed you? Is there any losses on you? We suggest you to file a report at your local police station.

Best Regards,
AllSafe
NotEthan - AllSafe 
hello AllSafe,

What i meant was they are scamming us aka thier members. There was no losses on mine but does NOT MEAN i wont expose fake hosts as i know that many others are. They are inviting and they are getting lied on, I tried talking with the owner but he wont stop...
its not me i am worried about my friend.. its the members of thier host who still thinks that this scam host (nixxon) is gonna release
i am doing my own diging on this scam host and owner's previous hosts to find if he owned any other FAKE hosts or SMP.
All We want is to give everyone a better place and not let these scammers....
And btw they were advertising a SMP on there so i highly understand What they are doing... 

Ur friendly (not if ur scamming or are a scammer)
Ethan!
AllSafe - Hello NotEthan,

It comes to a conclusion that they are just unprofessional, we suggest you to change the title and tag of the thread, since no loss or gain in both parties. But I don't think this thread is needed as they just keep delaying their launch.

Best Regards,
AllSafe
NotEthan - AllSafe hello! they are not really unproffesional if they are not releasing for almost a year are they...
WhiteCat - u just say hello everytime ü§£
NotEthan - WhiteCat am trying to greet them the way they are greeting me üòÅ 
if they swear then they know
NotEthan - and All safe! 
i know to setup nodes, domains and everything on a host does not take more then a day unless fully custom...
(a fully custom everything takes 5 to 6 days which is acceptable ) BUT HOLY COW these arent just unproffesional, these are scammers and dumba**
FlyingMane - Boi what the hell boi
You claimed you had 32 threaded CPUs for free hosting... You are not in the clear to expose anyone really
AllSafe - Hello NotEthan,

They doesn't make any losses on you or trick you, leaving the server is the best option. Even if you report to police, they couldn't that any action on them as well. Shutting down their Discord Server? That's not against Discord terms of services.

Best Regards,
AllSafe
NotEthan - AllSafe 

what if i tell u i had been on the hosting for 3 months and was waiting for it to release... does that not trick me?

it might not be against discord TOS but i am pretty sure what is aboutta happend... MORE DELAY
AllSafe - Hello NotEthan,

A short answer, it is totally your willingness to or not to wait. If you look back in the history, there are many things planned to release but keep being delayed or just end up not happening at all. However, that does not make him committed a crime or fraud. 

Best Regards,
AllSafe
NotEthan - and ur not replying..great lol
NotEthan - AllSafe hello!
thats true! many good hostings took months to release!
many good hosts even took longer then that!
but thats not what i am talking about...
these people i find are people i actually know...
they are scammers and we all know a scammer  cant be trusted

lets say you opened fraud hostings before... and your rep went bad
lets say that every time u opened a hosting...everyone knew its not gonna release
its the same case here...but not everyone knows thier scam... as i know the owner called "Sagnik Das"
who abuses and he did told me about it cuz at that time we were friends
that "sagnik " is the owner of nixxon (is reopening) and   yeah...
but a few days ago he asked me what job i did and wanted me to get them that job so he can earn money...
i clearly said "no" and that lead us to not bieng friends anymore
now if the guy is poor....if the guy dont have nodes...how can ya tell me they are legit on making the host...
OFC legend hostings like lush (not so sure but i think so) and i think cygen was too took some time...
its a fraud if they are just lying to thier members for more members and advertise thier socials...

Its illegal...
now i dont have anything bad with ya but am just saying i see u on many threads and see u protecting the other scam/suspects hostings...
no offense but i think you should do the digging too...
ty!
EvilHappy - chill guys
AllSafe - Hello NotEthan,

I understand your frustration, I suggest you to send him a link to this thread. The best bet for this thread is wait and see they do launch or not.

Best Regards,
AllSafe
NotEthan - AllSafe hey man! I think yeah thats the best thing to do...i'll do it
Asharib - NotEthan 
Hello NotEthan, 

We have released our host. As we said we would release it in starting of Jan but due to some problems our host got delayed but its now finally out!

If you have any inquiry feel free to let us know, here is a link to our discord server https://discord.gg/HvB6xFUSqY

Best,
A4As
Aaron_ - Asharib OH MY GOD FINALLY
Vamp_ - Hey,
So let me get this straight? Opening a host to gain members huh? We take time to launch our host due to personal reasons which surely do not concern you, we want everything to be perfect and not launch a host within a day rushing and not finishing everything and rushing a release. And image lying to your members about having a 32 core CPU for a free host, now that's what is called scamming/baiting people into joining your host. Wanna check us out and try to point out our flaws? We welcome you with open hands~!!

Vamp_ - Aaron_ Oh hey Aaron, miss me?
Asharib - Aaron_ Yes!
Aaron_ - Vamp_ You guys have generated documents.
RianOP9784 - Aaron_ wtf lmfao
Aaron_ - Took you guys long enough huh
Vamp_ - Aaron_ Nope
Vamp_ - Your Minerserver has generated docs by https://termly.io I presume.
Aaron_ - Contabo for everything, I see.
Vamp_ - Aaron_ That's right, no harm in using contabo isn't it.
Vamp_ - RianOP9784 Says who?
Vamp_ - And he deletes it.
Aaron_ - Vamp_ Better than nothing eh.
Vamp_ - Aaron_ We did plan on going for hetzner dedis, then changed our minds and switched to contabo for now
Aaron_ - Vamp_ Unlike https://www.privacypolicygenerator.info/, they at least know what they're doing.
Aaron_ - Vamp_ There's really no problem with using contabo. They are better than what they used to be.
Vamp_ - Aaron_ Well its still generated and we haven't generated one.
Vamp_ - Aaron_ Yes true. They don't lag much as they used to.
Aaron_ - Vamp_ Yeah. They don't overallocate as fuck anymore which is a good practise.
Vamp_ - Aaron_ Yeah. Can't we take this to discord dms? üòÇ
Aaron_ - Vamp_ Probably, lol. I still don't know what to expect from Asharib.
Vamp_ - Aaron_ Asharib was never the cause for anything, Sagnik was...
Aaron_ - Vamp_ Sagnik most likely screwed up the new hosts. Asharib killed the old hosts himself.
Aaron_ - He shouldn't be a CEO after how he had behaved with his clients.
Vamp_ - Aaron_ Sagnik yes he did and was the cause of all the old drama...
Vamp_ - Aaron_ Sagnik?
Aaron_ - Vamp_ Asharib.
Vamp_ - Aaron_ He won't be behaving the same was as before, well that's the whole point of the host rebrand, forgetting the past and fixing our mistakes.
Shershah - Vamp_ sorry but drama.gg ppls dont forget past.
Aaron_ - Asharib caught providing compromised minecraft accounts on his second server üì∏

Kowone - SagnikDas dumb bass

Kowone - SagnikDas ah shit, another revival of shit host
Vamp_ - Aaron_ Still wanna laugh at that or you just gonna cry about how Minerserver got broke and shut down?
Milan1000 - Vamp_ damn u got hurt by aaron laughing LMFAO + ratio + bozo + L + you fell off + you own a skid host + stfu
Aaron_ - Vamp_ Why would I cry about minerserver? Fortunately we are not witchly. We don't have a bitter past like your friend Asharib.
Aaron_ - Also we do not bluntly advertise our host on threads like you and your friend.
dxqt - why are you banned üôÅ
