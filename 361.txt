RenderMelon - I saw the custom status of a CFO, and it said "CFO, Nether-Hosting", so I asked for an invite.


This is where the weird part comes. Their Discord-server is called "Nether-Hosting":


They also have a rules channel, but it's called Fire-Node there 🤔 They are also abusing Discord's rules-channel-thing, because there are no rules. They just applied the icon to draw attention to their arguments for being the best, their payment methods and links.


When you open the domain that they give you (nether-hosting.nl), you find this:

Why is it called ZardHosting now??? Why would you want to operate under 3 names??

As you can see from the Wappalyzer (a tool to find technologies behind a website) menu that I have opened, you can see that they are using WHMCS. Unfortunately, this is nulled.


This got me interested in their cPanel license, and yes, also nulled:


The footer of their website says that they do not need to be registered, because they are Belgian.

There is a Chamber of Commerce in Belgium, it is called "Kamer van Koophandel" and you must be registered there.

After all, I think this is yet another hosting owned by kids that want to make a quick buck and therefore don't pay for their licenses. They operate under 3 names which is very unprofessional and their footer states absolute non-sense.

Added after around about 10 minutes: One of the COO's tried scamming me with fake credit card information for 'free Discord Nitro' earlier. I only just saw that he is the COO, which is why I am adding this now.

Added after 15 minutes: An alt account with the Fire-Node logo just came online and has the management role. Alts are not allowed. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-04-10/1618035821-222094-image.png

FireNode has rebranded to Netherhosting. Firenode is by originated from Maikel and Stijn. Sadly, after talking with Maikel, Stijn took it away from him.

As render mentioned above.
Julian (CrystifyDev) is a well known scammer. He was all on the "imma use fake iban at hetzner" with Bryan K.



Julian is CEO / Owner in Zardhosting.
COO in Nether-Hosting.

Be honest. How the fuck can u offer a legit 0,30 cent / GB with legit servers?
He has exploited a lot of stuff, including for domains and such.
He wanted to buy Cracked licenses from Aspect (His licenses word, afaik)


Just here to clairify some of rubens story, i've had contact with them for over 6 months now. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-04-10/1618047878-693263-image.png

FireNodeEU - Hello, im here to give a little status update and to clear some rumors about FireNode.

Im the CEO of by then known as firenode.xyz, now known as firenode.eu.
I wanted to clear some fake rumors made about my FireNode, and make sure you dont confuse my FireNode with the fake one.

The FireNode now known as nether-hosting/zardhosting is a fake FireNode that stole my name, they wouldn't change it until i legally registered my name in the netherlands and they had to change it.

Julian (CrystifyDev) is a well known scammer as ThatGeek said, and he also partially used my hosting to scam someone which i think was ThatGeek (not sure), as i offered a free server and then Julian told my client he had to pay for the server, and all that money did not go to me.
And @mituishere and @Bxrk already had contact with me, where then was proven those screenshots are fake, and that its very easy to fake it. (also as seen in the screenshot Bxrk used betterdiscord which is against discords TOS)
They also left some fake reviews which made my average review go down to 3.2.
The stolen website and logo is easily explained, the logo was made by my old friend who told me he made it himself, and about the website he told me that it was an open source template.

This was all i had to make clear about FireNode, i hope people now dont confuse my FireNode with the fake one.

Greetings, Ruben.
CEO at FireNode.eu
Grabstop - FireNodeEU Just to confirm this is your website?
Deleted User - FireNodeEU When the fuck did I contacted you??? 100% it wasn't in October as I left everything Drama.gg related. The website was never an open source template, as it was specially made for a company which is now dead. No one has wrights to use it, as in matter of speaking, you're still using that stolen website and you're still using that stolen logo. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-11-05/1636101247-589901-captura-de-ecran-din-2021-11-05-la-103233.png
