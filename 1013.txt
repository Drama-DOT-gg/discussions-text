Oliver1234dotdot - This guy has threatened me to put me on drama.gg for not getting a refund on my host, after which he got an refund (I just wanted to see why he wanted a refund)

He then threatenes me to put me on drama.gg,


This is completely unfair, and I would recommend to stay long away from him.

So just be careful ðŸ˜ƒ - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-09-16/1631830929-215543-image.png
