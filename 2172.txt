ItzScriptsIsBack - Hello,
I'm here to expose the mighty "dont"abuse for fighting "fraud" with actual fraud. Dennis (the owner of dontabuse) DDos's hosting services to take them down, even if they aren't fraudulent. Dennis is also working with people known to cause dataloss such as khootiee (the owner of CloudMC which has already drastically failed in the past). Hes also disk filling hosting services and more, so ask yourself, can this "anti-fraud" "company" really be trusted? The answer is no.

ItzScriptsIsBack - Think that's enough proof as of now but let me know if you need anything more
SoSad - Dude why the fuck didnt you embed the images
d0aq - Hello Lewis Goom,

I am Wilma Dickfit and I have been assigned to your case.

Your last post was removed due to you it being childish, I do think the same will happen to this one.

However, Discord screenshots are not conclusive proof, also with those screenshots, why does the font look off with them?

Please embed your images in the future.

Wilma Dickfit
Executive @ dontabuse
d0aq - Dear Mr Goom,

Who is "Deleted User" in those images.

Thanks,

djoh - i love diskfilling empirenodes.cloud - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-07-24/1690241859-228991-image.png
djoh - speaking of the theme of this thread, i dont remember dennis doing anything harmful by himself since he literally can't do anything LOL so in my opinion your arguments against the very awesome CEO of dontabuse are invalid thanks.
also note that im not anyhow related to said dontabuse so you cant assign my actions to them
d0aq - djoh 

Hello user!

Thank you for your input to this thread.
Yes, I cannot agree more, Dennis really doesn't do much, he mostly asks the other members on his team to do it for him.

Thanks
Wilma Dickfit
Executive @ dontabuse
ItzScriptsIsBack - d0aq Dennis, if you go to https://shady.gg/dontabuse.html theres proof of it being dennis.
ItzScriptsIsBack - d0aq False. My last post was removed due to not providing enough evidence, and I was instructed to open a new one with more evidence as I have done.
ItzScriptsIsBack - d0aq The font looks off with them as they are taken from https://shady.gg/dontabuse.html
ItzScriptsIsBack - djoh In the screenshots, it shows that Dennis talking about DDoSing. Even if he can't do it himself does not mean he cannot get somebody else from dontabuse to do for it him. This post isnt primarily about Dennis himself, however about dontabuse as a whole.
Jxshxx11 - ItzScriptsIsBack funny how you talk about cloudmc and khootiee pretending to have never been a part of it. Y’all switch sides so often that it ain’t funny anymore, just annoying. Every couple of months one of you come up with a complaint about each other. Both sides stay silent until one of them accuses the other, then everything comes out. So take your hypocrisy and shitty complaints elsewhere.
ItzScriptsIsBack - Jxshxx11 What do you mean? I haven't worked with khootiee since december last year (lol). I sold him my home server almost a month ago which he hasn't paid for (he also tried to get somebody to card it for him, saw 6 blocked payments for fraud to the payment link i made and sent directly to/for him).
d0aq - ItzScriptsIsBack 

Hello Lewis Goom,

I am Wilma Dickfit, not sure if you remember me from yesterday, I was handling your case.

Now in regards to this URL, it can be used maliciously as well as it can be edited to anything of the holders wish.

Hello Lewis,

From my records you have indeed tried to get people to card your own stripe checkouts.

Thanks
Wilma Dickfit
Executive @ dontabuse
ItzScriptsIsBack - d0aq I'm sorry? Can you show me where you have gotten these 'records' from?
ItzScriptsIsBack - d0aq - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-07-25/1690287850-724988-image.png
ItzScriptsIsBack - d0aq You've just incriminated Dennis. Asking someone else to do something like that for you just makes you as responsible for the actions as the people who did it. Lets say I hire a hitman on somebody, that person gets killed, they find out I paid the hitman, I'm getting charged for the murder.

Executive @ dontabuse
ItzScriptsIsBack - d0aq Have you ever heard of a joke?

1) I would never get someone to card for me or card myself
2) I don't even know how to card
3) I have an invoice for my purchase of Vape V4 - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-07-25/1690288546-740917-image.png

Thanks,

d0aq - ItzScriptsIsBack 
Hello Lewis,

I'm afraid this isn't good enough as bank statements will be needed to prove this.
You were also asking other users to card it for you.
Also that invoice means nothing, you put your email in, nothing special.

Thanks,
Wilma Dickfit
Executive @ dontabuse
curiousartem - ItzScriptsIsBack why are we talking about vape rn btw
curiousartem - am i not understanding something
ItzScriptsIsBack - d0aq I'm sorry but I'm not very comfortable sharing my private information such as bank statements to you, thanks.
d0aq - ItzScriptsIsBack 
Hello Mr Goom,

You may blur our the sensitive information.

Thanks
Wilma Dickfit
Executive @ dontabuse
ItzScriptsIsBack - d0aq Bank statements themselves are sensitive infomation. 😄
curiousartem - ItzScriptsIsBack you may blur out the bank statements if you wish
ItzScriptsIsBack - curiousartem So you want me to provide a bank statement to you that is blurred out? 😅

ItzScriptsIsBack - @Robert can i ask is the unprofessional tag for me or dontabuse?
Robert - ItzScriptsIsBack this thread is about dontabuse, so it's for dontabuse.
ItzScriptsIsBack - Robert alright
Win - robert u good chief, why u assigning unprofessional for no reason lmao. drama.gg isn't "professional" either so i don't really know what you are talking about
ItzScriptsIsBack - Win not trying to speak for robert but dontabuse isnt professional at all (not in the slightest) so like
Win - ItzScriptsIsBack neither drama.gg or dontabuse itself is professional, i just don't agree with claim of something being "unprofessional" if its on a site called drama.gg with a server that is more racist than the KKK
SoSad - ItzScriptsIsBack Nah bro they very professional they have a dozen of agents worldwide including Wilma Dickfit
ItzScriptsIsBack - SoSad oh yeah sorry i forgot about Wilma Dickfit and Helda Dick

Robert - Win Yeah I banned him, and he also came back with an alt
Robert - SoSad Most were from when other people were still moderating this place. We have since gotten stricter and now we don't want any discrimination, period.

yellowsenpai - 69 of 69 posts : 💀
ItzScriptsIsBack - yellowsenpai 💀
Justin - d0aq Being this formal, it just makes me wonder. Is there a kid behind this using something like chatgpt?
NaysKutzu - ItzScriptsIsBack How is that ddosing using filezila or what mate you blind?
ItzScriptsIsBack - NaysKutzu He took a screenshot of filezilla which contains an IP of something I was hosting pterodactyl on, 2 minutes later it goes down.
NaysKutzu - ItzScriptsIsBack How is that proof that he ddosed I mean it's just a pic of an IP it's not like you can't find an IP using ipinfo.info or something like that, I mean grow up kid you're only 15 take a break and go outside and imagine calling yourself lewis goom https://drama.gg/d/2094-lewis-g-aka-itzscripts-alvapepsi
NaysKutzu - Also, I'm not even gonna start on how you are breaking the discord terms of service and other illegal stuff you got going on so if you won't stop acting like a 9yo ima post them public, and you may end up with legal problems' lewis goom
ItzScriptsIsBack - NaysKutzu First of all that thread you listed was from January 2023 😄
secondly, dennis literally admitted in our group chat that he got somebody to ddos it which makes him just as responsible for getting somebody to ddos for him
ItzScriptsIsBack - NaysKutzu ok well with that i literally have no idea what your on about so please enlighten me
ItzScriptsIsBack - also, lets not remind ourselves of the time you used nulled WHMCS
NaysKutzu - ItzScriptsIsBack Swag get over it it's a fucking developer license for whmcs that's why I did not have products you smart ass and btw dennis does not even ddos are you insane, you are reality accusing some 1 of doing something with no proof whatsoever so you better chill our till I'm not going to post everything to expose you even now you are underage to use specific platforms so chill out my friend
ItzScriptsIsBack - NaysKutzu i know dennis doesnt ddos, but he gets people to ddos for him which he has blatantly admitted to. somebody who doesnt want me to share their name said to me, "if you hire a hitman to kill somebody and you get caught, your the one getting the charges for hiring the hitman"
NaysKutzu - ItzScriptsIsBack How dumb are you. You have no proof whatsoever that dennis has some 1 that is doing that and btw why TF shall he even ddos a host how does that help everyone from here that is mentally stable knows that ddos-ing someone/host because it's just going down for like 2 minutes or how long the ddos attack it's going to last I mean be real after a start of a ddos attack the servers are gonna work if some 1 just turns on some firewall stuff etc. I mean get real ddosing does not damage a server or breaks anything so yeah
ItzScriptsIsBack - NaysKutzu late a look at https://shady.gg/dontabuse.html for me, thanks. also if i look far enough i can find multiple pieces of evidence of dennis admitted to getting people to ddos for him in our group chat
ItzScriptsIsBack - anyways, going to go for a bit, this isnt worth my time, i'll check back later
NaysKutzu - You just broke 2 terms of service just while talking over here, I mean bruh. AND ON YOUR FUCKING HITMAN THING, BOTH GET THE CHARGES I MEAN YOU CAN'T GET AWAY BY KILLING SOME 1 IM WARNING YOU 1 MORE TIME USE YOUR FUCKING BRAIN TILL IT'S NOT LATE THE ONLY TIME WHEN YOU SAW THE SUN WAS IN A VIDEOGAME GO OUT PLAY WITH SOME KIDS YOU ARE 14-15 LIVE YOUR LIFE DON'T JUST SIT LIKE BEHIND A KEYBOARD AND DO NOTHING WITH YOUR LIFE
NaysKutzu - Also, about your thing on shady.gg/dontabuse.html is against discord terms of service and it's a HTML file anyone can edit that that's not proof whatsoever, so you may stop now
PadowYT2 - NaysKutzu kinda no need to use caps
NaysKutzu - PadowYT2 He got me mad he is a kid that dose not understand how the real world works and so
SoSad - This case should be handled by Wilma Dickfit
Jxshxx11 - ItzScriptsIsBack this just proves my earlier point. Y’all have your little group chat, and as soon as one of you do something that the other dislikes, you go on a rant bout each other and make these stupid threads. And when that happens, the dark side of both parties is now shown publicly, and you keep arguing bout who’s done worse.
NaysKutzu - SoSad true
ItzScriptsIsBack - NaysKutzu i know you both get charges however the point is that you get charged aswell. also please let me know what terms i've broken, thanks
ItzScriptsIsBack - NaysKutzu im sorry your getting mad over a text platform
ItzScriptsIsBack - SoSad i agree
ItzScriptsIsBack - Jxshxx11 im not really going on a rant, i seriously dont really care about "dontabuse" whats-so-ever. im simply just having fun
ItzScriptsIsBack - NaysKutzu pretty sure your like 15-16 (could be wrong but legend says what a legend says) 😄 

I know a lot more about "the real world" than you if your wasting your time slandering people such as me by making "yesabuse.co.uk"
ItzScriptsIsBack - It's funny how dennis and yourself try to make false accusations against me then as soon as I respond to it you both go dead silent.
ItzScriptsIsBack - NaysKutzu coming from somebody that is sitting behind a keyboard doing nothing with their life
NaysKutzu - ItzScriptsIsBack yesabuse.co.uk is not mine sir
NaysKutzu - ItzScriptsIsBack Please point me to the false accusation i made please sir.
NaysKutzu - ItzScriptsIsBack Sir please do not use my own words i roasted you with that so don't get mad at me please sir
ItzScriptsIsBack - NaysKutzu "Also, I'm not even gonna start on how you are breaking the discord terms of service and other illegal stuff you got going on so if you won't stop acting like a 9yo ima post them public, and you may end up with legal problems' lewis goom"
ItzScriptsIsBack - NaysKutzu what do you mean "roasted"? your clearly still a child as i've never seen somebody that isnt an adult use the word "roasted", especially in 2023. so i dont know why your calling me a kid, also im not getting mad, i seriously do not even care about you or dennis, im simply having fun
ItzScriptsIsBack - NaysKutzu is that why a few months ago i got you scared so you would take my name out of it
NaysKutzu - ItzScriptsIsBack 
Hi this is Wilma dickfit friend he can't answer your bullshit the hole time. You broke the terms of service by just exporting the group conversation, so yeah
ItzScriptsIsBack - NaysKutzu for starters, i never expored the group conversations, i simply read them
NaysKutzu - Ohh sir and btw you are the only 1 from here that runs an abused host called halex https://discord.gg/bEmrmBEJ I mean over 99% know what halex dose so is there really a point you shall continue this conversation??
ItzScriptsIsBack - NaysKutzu i dont run it, i'm simply a CEO and help with development
NaysKutzu - ItzScriptsIsBack 
Hello Lewis Goom,

I am Wilma Dickfit`s friend and I have been assigned to help you in your case.

I'm 100% sure that exporting a discord group conversation is 100% against discord terms of service there are some sensitive information inside that conversation, so we may ask you to remove the conversation! 
Also, btw an HTML file does not prove anything you can just edit that it's HTML file

ItzScriptsIsBack - NaysKutzu as i just said, i did not export the group conversation if you read. i simply read the group conversation from shady.gg
NaysKutzu - Hello Lewis Goom,

You want to say that you are not a kid, and you aren't acting childish?

Please explain to me what this means then

I'm sorry but a proof is a proof that's just proof of how an idiot you are, and we are not going to even talk about why you work for a host that abuses like halex

Aplimmm - NaysKutzu please stop acting childish, i dont get why you keep calling lewis a kid and saying lewis act childish while as far as i've seen you are the one that act childish. you go from denying the fact that dennis/dontabuse is a fraud to saying lewis break multiple tos, even tho as far as in know lewis didnt break any tos. im not supporting lewis nor dennis in any way, but seeing you act this way just annoy me
NaysKutzu - Hello Aplimmm,ItzScriptsIsBack

Ohh hi badsk missed you baby how is your day?? Anyway nice pic of a server that you got right there i got even better 1 not just crap servers like yours anyway where was i ohh yeah forgot it looks like you are trying to ignore the fact that you abuse in halex i mean suree

SoSad - NaysKutzu ? Aplimmm is not badsk lol
ItzScriptsIsBack - NaysKutzu For starters, that's one of the servers in Halex. So I don't really see how its abuse. Also, I seriously do not care if you have a better server than me 😄 

Who's the childish one now?
How the tables indeed turn.
NaysKutzu - ItzScriptsIsBack
Hello Lewis Goom,

That can't be a server for halex since it has not networked as you showed in the picture so I don't know how you use that server with no internet connection also most of halex IPS on security trails are from hetzner and some other sussy providers so yeah

Wilma Dickfit`s friend
Executive @ hurawatch.at
ItzScriptsIsBack - NaysKutzu wdym it does have a internet connection 😄 its tunneled through CosmicGuard

also, the IP's you have are from ages ago, we have different machines, Halex has not even released
Jen - NaysKutzu Meanwhile you have pirated movies in your bio. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-07-30/1690727933-630734-money-mouth-facesmiley.png
ItzScriptsIsBack - Jen its funny because he's admitted to using pirated software multiple times, even on his website https://yesabuse.co.uk
NaysKutzu - Jen ok? im not doing illegal stuff, so it's fine in my country im making 4k€/mnt and 1.400€ profit so yeah go cry kids
ItzScriptsIsBack - NaysKutzu wdym? piracy is illegal
NaysKutzu - ItzScriptsIsBack How obsessed are you with that website, I alertly told ya that's not my website its @SuperHori69 website
ItzScriptsIsBack - NaysKutzu what country do you live in
ItzScriptsIsBack - NaysKutzu correct however when i was talking to him about it you was also there meaning your somewhat involved
SoSad - NaysKutzu Piracy is illegal
NaysKutzu - Me in Austria the domain is registered in rusia soooooo yeah
NaysKutzu - NaysKutzu In rusia its legal to do that so idk what you guys talking abt
ItzScriptsIsBack - NaysKutzu 
😃 - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-07-30/1690728411-110146-image.png
ItzScriptsIsBack - NaysKutzu yeah but you have just told me you live in australia not russia
SoSad - NaysKutzu You said in "your country" and you said your in austria so it is illegal
NaysKutzu - ItzScriptsIsBack 1 the domain is in Russia 2 i live in Austria not Australia
ItzScriptsIsBack - NaysKutzu dont remember asking for your salary
NaysKutzu - ItzScriptsIsBack when did i ask for your opinion
Tomas - ItzScriptsIsBack honestly pirating whmcs isn't that big of a deal, the software's pure garbage

paying for whmcs is a bigger deal than pirating it
ItzScriptsIsBack - Tomas its still piracy, its still illegal
Tomas - ItzScriptsIsBack no one gives a fuck though 🙂
Tomas - Tomas respectfully
ItzScriptsIsBack - Tomas either way, who said WHMCS was the only thing he's pirated, he's admitted to pirating WHMCS, movies, "WebStorm" or whatever
Tomas - ItzScriptsIsBack these are from huge companies, not like they're small developers or production companies - it harms no one
SoSad - Tomas Cmon bro its a huge deal man! The big company is missing out on 20 dollars!!!
Tomas - SoSad well cpanel would be missing out on like 50 dollars at this point for software that's worth about 5...
SoSad - Tomas Wait cpanel is 50 dollars? The fuck
Tomas - SoSad yeah for like 100 accounts its around 60 dollars
SoSad - Tomas No wonder people pirate it the fuck
ItzScriptsIsBack - love ur PSU's @NaysKutzu - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-07-30/1690739618-694384-image.png
ItzScriptsIsBack - love ur PSU's @NaysKutzu - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-07-30/1690739641-247739-image.png
NaysKutzu - ItzScriptsIsBack Now you are just looking for proof to attack me boy that's not how it works and how is that a proof that's just a pic of my servers lmao I have a lot of servers, and I'm not supposed to learn each server name or each CPU name if you really want to know about the server backend here you go https://status.mythicalsystems.tech
ItzScriptsIsBack - NaysKutzu na im not trying to attack you, im simply laughing at the fact that you thought a rack server was a PSU
ItzScriptsIsBack -  - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-07-31/1690802440-915534-image.png
SoSad - ItzScriptsIsBack Honestly his such a joke he goes after people he considers to "abuse" yet he still admits to abusing himself
NaysKutzu - ItzScriptsIsBack 1 You did not show all the dms before that i was talking about a psu idiot, A rack is where the servers are stored at and what I sent you was a psu thing so when the power gone down, so the servers won't shut down forced those batteries will safely shut down the servers, so no damage will be done
ItzScriptsIsBack - SoSad its actually so funny
ItzScriptsIsBack - NaysKutzu i dont have the dms before that, you said u wanted to buy a PSU then named "Seasonic S2N 801CCPS Redundant PSU In 2U Server". Also, lets stop making this thread about you shall we as its not about you its about dontabuse
NaysKutzu - ItzScriptsIsBack You are the only 1 who made it about you and me so yeah im here just to deny your false accusation for dontabuse
ItzScriptsIsBack - NaysKutzu what do you mean making it about you? you keep going on about yourself when we're talking about dontabuse, also false accusations? have you looked at the proof i've sent
NaysKutzu - ItzScriptsIsBack Please leave this website you have no proof whatsoever that dontabuse abuses a discord proof is not a valid proof and your childish acting won't even help as you saw in your last thread so yeah.
ItzScriptsIsBack - NaysKutzu look at the first message 😃
ItzScriptsIsBack - if you actually looked through the posts in this thread, you would see all the proof you need.
ItzScriptsIsBack - NaysKutzu discord proof is real proof as it legit contains text of dennis admitting to it
NaysKutzu - @ItzScriptsIsBack as I said that's not a proof it's a html document which was exported by a third party discord client which is against discord terms of services and look like you are promoting that so that's sus. And yeah your hole point is to make dontabuse look bad since your noabuse shit got down because you weren't doing shit, and you were adding fake takedowns and taking the wins of others like me so please grow up and just forget about it this thing won't help you in life so yeah
ItzScriptsIsBack - if your saying discord proof isnt valid your saying 84.74% of the proof on this website is invalid
ItzScriptsIsBack - NaysKutzu as i said if you looked through the post you would see screenshots i took from the discord client myself
NaysKutzu - ItzScriptsIsBack As I said, that proof is not valid since it's a html document and no full video. And it's being exported with an against discord terms of service client, so kindly please shut the fuck up, thanks!
ItzScriptsIsBack - NaysKutzu then ignore the html document and look at the screenshots i sent
ItzScriptsIsBack -  - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-07-31/1690830435-72615-image.png
ItzScriptsIsBack -  - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-07-31/1690830555-230506-image.png
Hmmmmm - This is @SoSad im just on my other account Anyways don't know why basically everyone in DontAbuse is still there even after the Owner/CoOwner/Whatever he calls himself has been found abusing and using illegal ways of abusing hosting services himself
NaysKutzu - ItzScriptsIsBack How is this a proof please explain that to me because im dumb so yeah explain please!
NaysKutzu - ItzScriptsIsBack And let me tell you something are doing something illegal at this moment since you are in the same team with badsk that cards, has CP and with that I don't mean control panels etc. so kindly shut the fuck up, or I will make sure you will get charged.
ItzScriptsIsBack - NaysKutzu well, if oyu think about it, when he said "no ddos" you would not really need to specify that unless the person who your getting to do it was already expecting for ddos which likely means he has gotten Bluekyeet to ddos for him before. Also he has admitted to getting other people to ddos for him so
ItzScriptsIsBack - NaysKutzu Where is your proof that badsk cards, has CP or anything? as i have provided a numerous amount of proof against dontabuse and you have provided none to back yourself up. so kindly shut the fuck up
Hmmmmm - ItzScriptsIsBack Their only proof of him "Carding or having cp" is just screenshots of discord messages sure we also do the same on (the site bad made) and on here but if they would bother getting actual proof maybe we would to
ItzScriptsIsBack - Hmmmmm its funny because he just said earlier that discord screenshots isnt proof 🤣
Hmmmmm - ItzScriptsIsBack Yeah they usually said that when its against them
NaysKutzu - ItzScriptsIsBack Hi my friend scripts missed you baby btw can you please explain this to me: - https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1119573684978466897/1135952923952677016/image.png?width=726&amp;height=444
ItzScriptsIsBack - NaysKutzu 1st of all, bit gay
secondly, i dont see whats wrong with sending a pattern?
ItzScriptsIsBack - also, its funny how whenever we say something against you, you go dead silent
ItzScriptsIsBack - until you have some "proof" against me, which isnt even "proof" of any kind
ItzScriptsIsBack - seriously, just stop trying.
Tomas - ItzScriptsIsBack "pattern" or a symbol adopted by a far-right political group from germany in the early 20th century?
ItzScriptsIsBack - Tomas what far-right political group from germany in the early 20th century would we be referring to?
NaysKutzu - ItzScriptsIsBack No i just have a social life men im sorry for having fun on my life insted of talking to  a scumbag online and that sign is a naz*
ItzScriptsIsBack - even Cylde AI says its a pattern because it is
NaysKutzu - That's not legal asf in my country and you can fucking get a fine and even prison for making fun of that thats not funny kid
ItzScriptsIsBack - NaysKutzu im not making fun of anything?? also speaking about getting a fine and even prison, maybe you should think about that before admitting to using pirated software.
NaysKutzu - OMG DUDE GET OVER IT NO 1 FUCKING CARE ABOUT WHMCS AND ALSO THAT WAS A DEVELOPER LICENSE I HAD NO RIGHTS TO SELL ON IT. SO I NEVER SOLD SOMETHING ON THAT WHMCS INSTALL ARE YOU FUCKING DUMB I MEAN ARE YOU DUMB GET OVER IT OR YOU CAN'T BECAUSE THAT'S THE SINGLE THING THAT YOU THINK YOU CAN ACCUSE ME OF LMAFO
ItzScriptsIsBack - NaysKutzu what makes you think i'm only on about WHMCS
ItzScriptsIsBack - theres 3 things you have admitted to pirating, WHMCS, movies (according to Jen), webstorm or something on "yesabuse"
ItzScriptsIsBack - but yet again, making this thread about youself
NaysKutzu - ItzScriptsIsBack You are the one who made it about myself so stfu right now and leave this platform go outside and play like normal kids of your age make real life friends
NaysKutzu - https://nayskutzu.onlyfans.pics/i?i=1690904964 Goodbye
ItzScriptsIsBack - NaysKutzu what do you mean, i have been going on about dontabuse until you come back in here and start talking about youself 🤣. this is truely funny. now goodbye, please don't come back
ItzScriptsIsBack - NaysKutzu Robert has already seen this thread and tagged it with Illegal Activities and Unprofessional, but okay?
NaysKutzu - How dumb are you where did dontabuse do something illegal please point me to that and send proof thanks
ItzScriptsIsBack - NaysKutzu if you look up through the posts you would see everything you need to see as i have stated before. also, what happened to our little "goodbye"?
ItzScriptsIsBack - NaysKutzu also, just to finish things off with you, as you claimed yourself, discord screenshots isnt valid proof
NaysKutzu - ItzScriptsIsBack ok then agree that this thred is a bulshit!
ItzScriptsIsBack - NaysKutzu well no, the thing is discord screenshots is valid proof, but your just saying its not which is admtiting your "proof" is absent
NaysKutzu - Pleas sir just shut the fuck up no 1 cares about what you say and you are just making this longer that it shall be we are at 200 posts so kindly shut the fuck up and please go look for help because you are the only 1 saying that dontabuse is working with abusers etc when you are fucking working with badsk so i mean shut up kiddo
ItzScriptsIsBack - NaysKutzu the only reason its got 200 posts is because you keep going on about your bs, lol. what do you expect me to do? just sit quiet and let you make false accusations against me? no.
ItzScriptsIsBack - but of course, you need to get the last word.
NaysKutzu - ItzScriptsIsBack No i don't its just you're thinking that you can do whatever you want and thinking that everyone shall do what you say so yeah so please go get some help
ItzScriptsIsBack - NaysKutzu im sorry but can you give me 1 example of where i have thought that? lol.
ItzScriptsIsBack - and once again, you are trying to get the last word.
NaysKutzu - ItzScriptsIsBack can you just prove me what's the point in this please i just want know how will this help its not like everyone is going to check for dontabuse or so i mean they do a lot of good stuff
ItzScriptsIsBack - NaysKutzu the main purpose of this is me laughing at you guys which is working really well actually so i dont know man
ItzScriptsIsBack - but overall, i dont care about dontabuse, you can do whatever you want, im simply laughing at skids
NaysKutzu - ItzScriptsIsBack Idk about that because the only 1 laughing right now is the mod and me seeing how dumb you are and ignoring my fucking messages and not reading them and actually getting help or start making friends and not being so much online xD
NaysKutzu - ItzScriptsIsBack Sir please explain what skid / skids mean for you!
ItzScriptsIsBack - NaysKutzu what do you mean? i have read and replied to almost every single message you have sent LOL
ItzScriptsIsBack - etc - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-08-01/1690907531-744121-image.png

ItzScriptsIsBack - etc - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-08-01/1690907542-783275-image.png
ItzScriptsIsBack - NaysKutzu for me, a "skid" is somebody who steals code or commits crimes such as DDoSing or pirating
NaysKutzu - ItzScriptsIsBack Ok why you always online / why you still on halex as owner why you work with a guy that does illegal stuff
NaysKutzu - ItzScriptsIsBack Sir skid means something else its Script Kiddy and that means a person like you getting source codes from github and changing 2 stuff and re-uploading them with their licenses.
ItzScriptsIsBack - NaysKutzu 1) if you mean why im always online in drama.gg its because i just have the tab open and i see the notification (1) on the tab so i check it. if you mean on discord, im not, i just stay up until like half 2am working on a little project of mine
2) primarily for a source of income to fund my own projects
ItzScriptsIsBack - NaysKutzu that lines in with the first part stealing code. but what i stated above is what i mean when i say skid
ItzScriptsIsBack - but in reality, i dont really mean you any harm and/or want to argue with you. i dont really have anything against you, only dontabuse
NaysKutzu - ItzScriptsIsBack I just explained you what that means, i did not call you a skid for god’s sake READ
Tomas - newsflash - no one cares
shut up
ItzScriptsIsBack - NaysKutzu i know you didnt call me a skid. i'm simply agreeing with what you said however also saying that what i mean by skid is what i said earlier
NaysKutzu - ItzScriptsIsBack Well that what you said is wrong skid is only script kiddy
NaysKutzu - Tomas Don't have to be rude!
ItzScriptsIsBack - NaysKutzu i know but hwen i say it specifically that is whati  mean
Hmmmmm - NaysKutzu You said discord screenshots isnt good proof so why are you sending it yourself?
Jen - NaysKutzu Technically it is illegal you dumbass. And I didn't ask about how much money you make. Why don't you do something productive in life also the amount of profit you make i make more in a weekly paycheck LMFAO
Aplimmm - this thread is quite funny, it turn from a normal thread talking about fraud n stuff to a thread about 2 people figthing over whos more childish or smthing
Aplimmm - NaysKutzu piracy is illegal in any way, and since you makes 4k€/m why dont you stop being an asshole and pay for those?
Jxshxx11 - Aplimmm it always has been like that my dude.
Once this thread dies down, it’ll be back in a few months time with likely the same people.
ItzScriptsIsBack - Aplimmm was trying to keep it on topic, but this nayskutzu guy wouldnt stop talking about that bs, seemed to have shut him up now
NaysKutzu - ItzScriptsIsBack Sir can you please tell me on what kind of weed you on i just want to know!
ItzScriptsIsBack - NaysKutzu idk man, all sorts, but besides the point

ItzScriptsIsBack - meFqulted as a legend says.
NaysKutzu - ItzScriptsIsBack hi baby how was your day? i hope good! Anyway, can you please explain this to me pleaseeee - https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1119573684978466897/1136753356593971270/image.png?width=642&amp;height=142
ItzScriptsIsBack - clearly inspect element lmfao
ItzScriptsIsBack - even if that was true, doesnt go against the facts of what you have done.
ItzScriptsIsBack - also, love how your speaking for dennis since he got muted/banned for a reason.
ItzScriptsIsBack - seriously, stop making a joke out of yourself, stop making false accusations against me.
NaysKutzu - LOL its not inspect kiddo
ItzScriptsIsBack - NaysKutzu also, once again, bit gay, dont get any ideas man, im not attracted to you
ItzScriptsIsBack - NaysKutzu prove it then
NaysKutzu - get mad
ItzScriptsIsBack - its funny because, every time you try to make a false accusation against me, i just respond, completely demolish you, then you go dead silent until you have another false accusation to accuse me of. it's the same cycle going over and over and in the end, i will win, regardless, theres nothing you can do, as i have not done anything wrong. yet you have.
ItzScriptsIsBack - i've provided 25+ proof against dennis, you have provided like 1-3 fake screenshots of something way out of context and tried to do something with it then lost every single time, as i say, stop trying, your wasting your time.
ItzScriptsIsBack - now once again, he's gone dead silent until he finds another false accusation to accuse me of, we'll see what it will be next time.
ItzScriptsIsBack - wont be responding to this thread anymore as its a complete and total waste of my time, if you want to talk add me on discord: itzscripts

Thanks

ItzScriptsIsBack - NaysKutzu i did not agree to that as it is not valid proof, i was simply making the claim that you in your own words said that it wasnt valid proof then posted discord screenshots as proof.

ItzScriptsIsBack - NaysKutzu if you would look at the screenshots provided by mefqulted above, you would see that dennis is a complete paedophile.
ItzScriptsIsBack - anyways, as some people may or may not know, i'm out of the hosting industry, for good. therefore i won't be on drama.gg anymore, i have also blocked each and every user involved with this (apart from a little few that i am friends with). so, have fun with whatever your doing, however, sincerely, i do not care, get a life, stop wasting your time. grow up.
SoSad - ItzScriptsIsBack Cant wait for you to come back within a week
Snyder - Hello!

I've been reading through this pile of bull shit drama, cuz all of you guys here have no lives, and just argue on Discord about shit things that no one will care about in your future life.

In advance, I will be replying to most responses from the earlier part of this thread.

Let's talk about piracy, shall we?
Most people do piracy to test things out.

I read something funny from Scripts, pirating WebStorm, pretty sure he said, Nays did it, does he know that you can get it for free using GitHub Students? Yes, that's how Badsk, get's his domains.
Pirating WHMCS is very common, and the same with movies, like why tf pay for Netlfix LMFAO.
(Not Saying I Pirate Movies.)

That's all I wanted to talk about, cuz everything else is bullshit, like Dennis, doing a DDoS. 
He is too dumb to do that. (Sorry Dennis). 

Mr. Scriptz, you are not an official CEO:
You're too young
Too Dumb
Knows nothing abt business

My R48, Badsk, pluto, whatever.:
Man said he does not go to school.
Probably why he does well with his abusing hosts and then goes downhill.
I am similar to him in one way, PROJECTS. He can't keep a project. (Not need info)

Mr. Scriptz, next time try to get valid proof about something rather than taking others' emails and payment proofs.
Snyder - I wrote irrelevant stuff, cuz i wanted to be apart of the bull shit talking.
Tomas - Please just stfu all of you
Jxshxx11 - Snyder "cuz all of you guys here have no lives"

My guy please, you just read this entire shitpost.
Snyder - Jxshxx11 

ye, I did, cuz I was taking a break from doing some front end.
I barely read it, I skimmed through it. would have taken me hours to read it.
ItzScriptsIsBack - Snyder ok ok, i know i said that i was done with this drama shit, but i felt the need to reply to this.

"not a ceo"

"knows nothing about business"
little does he know i take business studies 😀 - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-08-14/1692051152-690870-image.png
ItzScriptsIsBack - also on that last part about payments and proof or whatever, i dont understand what you mean as i dont recall doing that
ItzScriptsIsBack - Snyder most of it is just bs nays tryna get the last word, if you just skim through you'll prob be able to find the actual proof i've provided
ItzScriptsIsBack - anyways, i'll read through here every once in a while and i'll likely reply if i feel the need to.
Snyder - ItzScriptsIsBack 
Little does scripts know, i've don't business for 2 years now, and ima abt to do it for the third year, cuz i going to A-Levels. 😱
ItzScriptsIsBack - Snyder little does he know that i do not care what he does, and the reason i said i take business studies is to prove i know about business
Snyder 😱
Snyder - ItzScriptsIsBack 
little does he know, just learnign business for a few months does not mean he knows abt business
ItzScriptsIsBack - Snyder little does he know, i've been doing business related studies and projects for almost 8 years (in total, from when i first started my very first project all the way up to now)😅
ItzScriptsIsBack - Snyder cuz all of you guys here have no lives, and just argue on Discord about shit things that no one will care about in your future life.

bit ironic coming from you no?

Snyder I barely read it, I skimmed through it. would have taken me hours to read it.

now that your here, its making it even longer to read, your just as bad as nays 😛
Snyder - ItzScriptsIsBack 

How tf is ironic, I have a job in IRL unlike you mate, I have a life earning money unlike you, and railgun abusing hosts to run free shitty hosts that can't stay for 3 months.
ItzScriptsIsBack - Snyder its ironic as your sitting here on drama.gg arguing about shit nobody will care about in the future
ItzScriptsIsBack - also i didnt ask if you had a job or if you earn money. 😛
ItzScriptsIsBack - you see, the only literal reason this thread is full of bs is because kids like you who support frauduent "organizations" such as dontabuse keep coming back and trying to do something, yet every single time, literally i cannot stress enough, every single time i call any of you out for it you go dead silent for like a day then come back with some bs accusation. literally dennis got muted or banned or some shit its just fucking ridiculous at this point. give up and keep dreaming kid
ItzScriptsIsBack - i'll go through this thread and post all the proof in total here as skids such as nays has fulled the thread up making it impossible to actually read anything useful.
ItzScriptsIsBack - and then it gets 502 bad gateway, weird that.

Snyder - ItzScriptsIsBack 
LMFAO, you're the bullshit here.
You started this thread.
And you have no proof that I support Don't Abuse.

Mate you can't say fucking shit yourself. You abuse yourself with Layer now.
I have proof in your old DMS saying you don't like Layer anymore, that you won't work with him.
Your a main against your words. Oops did I say man, I meant child.
Snyder - I don't give 0 fucks about don't abuse.
ItzScriptsIsBack - Snyder
never said you support dontabuse 😛, though you are very clearly backing them up here.

also, how do i abuse? i dont even work with layer let alone own a host or a vps. as i said earlier, im done with the hosting industry.



and that is correct, i don't like him anymore. infact i would still have him blocked (i blocked him but had to unblock him) if i wasnt selling him something. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-08-17/1692273439-174731-image.png
ItzScriptsIsBack - u should update ur game, ur still playing in december 2022 it looks like
Snyder - ItzScriptsIsBack 

but u were is baklava owner role now u left
Hmmmmm - Snyder Dont worry he will be back in around a week or a month
ItzScriptsIsBack - Snyder indeed, i left, i left the hosting industry for good due to the amount of bad stuff it has caused into my personal life, leaving me no reason to stay.
ItzScriptsIsBack - Hmmmmm already got 3 other projects in development that has nothing to do w/ hosting 😛
Hmmmmm - ItzScriptsIsBack Cant wait for it to turn into 3 other NEW projects
ItzScriptsIsBack - Hmmmmm nah, you see, the problem was i was working alone on my projects, if your working alone theres nothing stopping you from quitting, however if your working with a team, you simply cannot just quit.
Hmmmmm - ItzScriptsIsBack You literally can
ItzScriptsIsBack - Hmmmmm well physically yeah but you have other people relying on you so
Hmmmmm - ItzScriptsIsBack Right so you just got random people to rely on you so you wouldn't quit 💀
ItzScriptsIsBack - Hmmmmm not random people, i work with people i've known for years. if you understood how this kind of stuff worked you would understand that it isn't as easy to just give up when you're working with a team. also, you said, and i quote (i believe it was you or somebody else but idk), "nobody will care about this in a few years".
ItzScriptsIsBack - if this thread gets flooded again by continues, useless arguing i'll repost the proof containing all the proof so people dont have to scroll up 150 messages to find it.
ast3risk - I understand Markdown, so I shall segment my response.

The proof provided by members in this thread

Discord screenshots (or any content/message screenshot) can be faked or taken out of context. If the message is public, link to it. (in Markdown do that by putting the image embed in a link box or by using HTML) If it isn't, provide other evidence to prove its validity.

The arguments

I mean, you guys are just going at each other with 0 regard to the topic at hand. Now, it's great you wanna point out the other has shitty business experience, but stop uselessly shouting about it.

You could also stop shouting about your stupid nicknames or unrelated shit and have a proper gentlemanly discu- it's the Internet, who am I kidding.

Also, each side is providing "proof" that can be faked or misunderstood, meaning the argument gets nowhere.

Conclusion

In closing, stop bitching about business experience, stick to the topic at hand, and use proof that can be validated.

Stop arguing useless points, and try to actually convince people.

P.S. I also believe some of this might be against the rules :)

P.P.S. Yes I fixed my account so I can actually post.
ItzScriptsIsBack - ast3risk
1) most of the proof was taken from a group chat i was in. also, if you say discord screenshots arent really that good of proof take a look at 90% of the other proof here.
2) i sincerely agree, which is why i keep having to repost the proof as they keep going on about random bs flooding the thread.

also, i have multiple different screenshots for one piece of evidence throughout some of the proof i've provided which i guess just shows more that it isn't faked. but still, i do get you when you say it can easily be faked, however 90% of "proof" on this platform is discord screenshots
ast3risk - ItzScriptsIsBack yes, which is why this platform is untrustworthy

Nothing here can be taken at face value.
ast3risk - ItzScriptsIsBack Also, I said if the message was public, and if a screenshot is real it can still be taken out of context.
ItzScriptsIsBack - ast3risk fair enough
ItzScriptsIsBack - ast3risk also fair enough, realistically, i don't give 2 fucks about these skids and dontabuse and all that shit. just entertaining myself, been quite bored lately. needed something to laugh at for the day.
ast3risk - ast3risk Which is why any screenshots of public discord messages I upload link back to their messages where possible.
ast3risk - ItzScriptsIsBack So you waste your time pushing pointless arguments? Not my kind of thing to be honest.
ItzScriptsIsBack - ast3risk i understand that, however most of the screenshots were taken from a group chat i am no longer in (as i stated earlier)
ItzScriptsIsBack - ast3risk legit got nothing better to do at the moment, as i said, really needed something to laugh at
CR072 - ItzScriptsIsBack Ig you were working with Layer and what tf is this place
CR072 - in this case, I am not responsible for anything + I never experienced the sqlite injection. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-08-22/1692723613-977930-image.png
CR072 - PadowYT2 at least they don't support the "lgbt""
CR072 - ItzScriptsIsBack There is no proof that quotes I support the EU.
SoSad - CR072 While i dont outright support LGBTQ i think its retarded to show hate towards them even when they don't need it sure I don't support it but I don't hate it either
CR072 - SoSad Verspreid nooit haat tenzij ze het verdienen
ast3risk - CR072 riiiiiiiiight, where's the audit? You haven't provided proof that your code was tested for SQL injection vulnerabilities.
ast3risk - Dennis's opinion (he has not shown proof to back these claims yet, this was sent to me in a DM, I can't link to it): - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-08-23/1692786854-686900-image.png
ItzScriptsIsBack - CR072 i'm working with layer on a minecraft server, but nothing hosting related.
ItzScriptsIsBack - CR072 as the owner of HolaClient, you shouldnt be letting your staff spread false information around such as companies that dont exist
ItzScriptsIsBack - CR072 imagine being homophobic and shit in 2023 bit sad cant lie
ast3risk - update: - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-08-23/1692787105-383687-image.png
ItzScriptsIsBack - CR072 on that post you replied to, i was showing that you put on your website "lets not celebrate the LGBTQ"
ItzScriptsIsBack - SoSad i agree with this, you don't have to support LGBTQ but showing hate towards it is just a whole different thing
ItzScriptsIsBack - ast3risk i was told by someone a while ago that it was SQL injection vuln, havent personally tested it as i wouldnt dare install such software onto my own machines.
ast3risk - ItzScriptsIsBack that's what VMs are for.
ItzScriptsIsBack - ast3risk 2nd part isnt true, i left as the hosting industry has genually done damage on my personal life, also, i did ban catjson for posting a picture of my face in the server aswell as dennis actually cant remember why but was prob for something retarded he hid, likely also posting a picture of my face but dont take my word for it
ItzScriptsIsBack - ast3risk eh dont feel like buying one atm + vmbox doesnt run that good on my pc
ItzScriptsIsBack - ast3risk 3rd part is true, i have only been in hosting for well actually a little over a year, but that does not mean in any way that i havent done anything business related way before hosting (because, well, i have 😛).
ast3risk - ItzScriptsIsBack Get a better PC then. You have to have a test box if you run a host, to test new features and such. I have a proxmox server to test shit but I hate the hosting industry sooo...
ast3risk - you can also try Hyper-V or QEMU
ItzScriptsIsBack - ast3risk i have a home server, but still, just really dont feel like fucking around with that kind of shit at the moment, also i am buying a new PC quite soon
ItzScriptsIsBack - ast3risk also, of course he hasnt provided any proof to back his claims, i dont see how people can trust this 14 year old kid (which i will say is it bit ironic as i am 14 but still i dont care if people trust me or not in this indsutry), its truely just mind blowing how his "dick-riders" will say a piece of text is BS before even reading it
ast3risk - @ItzScriptsIsBack - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-08-23/1692788313-992565-image.png
ItzScriptsIsBack - ast3risk 

not sure waht he means by me not quitting as i have left the hosting industry, for good, no matter what these 14yr old skids say, no matter how many pizzas they order to me house, im not returning. also the last part, very funny.
ast3risk - ItzScriptsIsBack I think he means you keep at it with the responses
ItzScriptsIsBack - ast3risk i still respond to here as this shit is funny asf and i've been bored as hell lately, and if stop responding i'll have 30 skids saying false shit abt me in this thread
ItzScriptsIsBack - ah, by the way, can you tell dennis that i'd like to hear from Willma Dickfit, he's been quite quiet lately
Jxshxx11 - ItzScriptsIsBack Why even bother to affiliate with him in the first place
SoSad - ast3risk Well if he wants to prove his claim is true then he should maybe consider sending proof
CR072 - ast3risk I never said I partnered with dontabuse
CR072 - ItzScriptsIsBack which staff
PadowYT2 - CR072 imagine deleting/hiding the channel with the message
ItzScriptsIsBack - Jxshxx11 i have a specific reason which i cant mention here
ItzScriptsIsBack - CR072 - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-08-25/1692957519-72915-image.png
ItzScriptsIsBack - PadowYT2 fr
ItzScriptsIsBack - i saw when i first sent that image that the message got deleted lmao
SnusQualityvideos - Imagine trying to ruin someone's servrr just because you think you better than them xdddddddd
ItzScriptsIsBack - SnusQualityvideos who are you referring to here
ItzScriptsIsBack - https://exyq.com/threads/dontabuse-fighting-fraud-with-fraud.28
thread is going to be continued here from now on
CR072 - PadowYT2 ;-; I said I did nothing, the one who sent it deleted it eventually after this thread
CR072 - ItzScriptsIsBack ig its croix's server
CR072 - he deleted the message and left the channel empty. So, I sent an embed like message
NaysKutzu - @ItzScriptsIsBack you idiot you said you are going to leave and never reply here anymore what happened to that???? Why you still here?
SoSad - NaysKutzu He always comes back lol
ItzScriptsIsBack - NaysKutzu lol actually, i said i'd reply if i felt the need to. and i said i had quit the hosting industry, not this, also move to https://exyq.com/threads/dontabuse-fighting-fraud-with-fraud.28, thanks
ast3risk - Then can someone lock this thread?
ItzScriptsIsBack - ast3risk
