arrowtan - xeroz.tech was good only for 2 months.
I first had a vps with them in India location for my Minecraft server and it ran well. It often overloaded as I ran multiple servers and it pretty much just lagged my Minecraft server and nothing much.
Later I renewed the VPS to start a MC hosting so I could provide Minecraft servers in India. 
Here are some pics before I explain






he repeatedly blamed us for the often crashes


I even showed him that we're not using much CPU and something is triggering high CPU from their side


I told him this yet he never replied to this


I knew he was lying as I ran 3-4 Minecraft servers previously before starting a host and they all used nearly 600%+ and even on overload they never crashed, they basically used to just get laggy and kick all players like every normal server.
We had multiple crashes 
This is where it happened


Our VPS went down for over 2 weeks and at the first day I asked for priority support and said I was interested in paying but he never replied back on that


he asked for my vps IP and never replied back regarding it, later when I tried to get back he claims he isn't free on weekends.
Later I contact him the next day and he claims to be on a break!
Before I continue let me tell you that he did some changes to the vps panel the before day which resulted in many of the vps clients having their services down and what does he do about it? HE GOES ON A LITERAL VACATION!


He doesn't even care about his customers!
He later says he blocked my sys admin when we were literally stressed about our Minecraft host as our clients were complaining about the service being offline. I was at my worst at that time as it was very depressing.

He later talks about compensation if the issue wasn't fixed in a week


he then says "If its not fixed this week it will be 2 months."
I was pretty fine with that, I tried to move on and understand him and waited. 
Guess what...
I never received the required help


and when I ask about the compensation, he shows attitude saying "Don't know what you are trying to get by dmming me, e-mail aiden@xeroz.tech directly"
That was the last convo we had with Patric/wicktor.

Now aiden. I really thought he wanted to help but he was just wasting our time.
He asked me for the vps IP and I provide it to him and then he says this


very funny ^^
I show him a pic of the IP and then he decides to not reply for 2 days


then he says this


Not helpful guys
Now he literally tells us to reinstall!!


Now that's just bad company service, I was ASSURED that there would be 0% dataloss 


yet it happened.
I reply back showing him that I'm unable to ssh into the vps and he tells me to try again!


Now here's the funny part

My VPS is suspended as the bill was overdue as I didn't pay for it at that time. I'm gonna tell you what I told him.
I was promised 2 months compensation
The vps was down for 2 weeks so I've been waiting for a fix and compensation so I didn't pay it.
Now he starts talking about the invoice where Patrick/wicktor had created a new invoice for me in the past so I can renew the vps and use it to start my mc host



I thought he was talking about the present invoice and I tell him that I was promised compensation so give it to me


Now he starts talking about the old expired invoice again



I finally understand at that time and explained to him here so he can understand


Here's the ultimate scam, He gives me only 17 days compensation, not what patrick agreed to give.
He pretty much just asks for the IP &amp; pass &amp; ignores me after that. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-08-23/1692786069-372158-image.png

yet it happened.
I reply back showing him that I'm unable to ssh into the vps and he tells me to try again!


Now here's the funny part

My VPS is suspended as the bill was overdue as I didn't pay for it at that time. I'm gonna tell you what I told him.
I was promised 2 months compensation
The vps was down for 2 weeks so I've been waiting for a fix and compensation so I didn't pay it.
Now he starts talking about the invoice where Patrick/wicktor had created a new invoice for me in the past so I can renew the vps and use it to start my mc host



I thought he was talking about the present invoice and I tell him that I was promised compensation so give it to me


Now he starts talking about the old expired invoice again



I finally understand at that time and explained to him here so he can understand


Here's the ultimate scam, He gives me only 17 days compensation, not what patrick agreed to give.
He pretty much just asks for the IP &amp; pass &amp; ignores me after that. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-08-23/1692786181-142912-image.png
arrowtan - xeroz.tech was good only for 2 months.
I first had a vps with them in India location for my Minecraft server and it ran well. It often overloaded as I ran multiple servers and it pretty much just lagged my Minecraft server and nothing much.
Later I renewed the VPS to start a MC hosting so I could provide Minecraft servers in India. 
Here are some pics before I explain






he repeatedly blamed us for the often crashes


I even showed him that we're not using much CPU and something is triggering high CPU from their side


I told him this yet he never replied to this


I knew he was lying as I ran 3-4 Minecraft servers previously before starting a host and they all used nearly 600%+ and even on overload they never crashed, they basically used to just get laggy and kick all players like every normal server.
We had multiple crashes 
This is where it happened


Our VPS went down for over 2 weeks and at the first day I asked for priority support and said I was interested in paying but he never replied back on that


he asked for my vps IP and never replied back regarding it, later when I tried to get back he claims he isn't free on weekends.
Later I contact him the next day and he claims to be on a break!
Before I continue let me tell you that he did some changes to the vps panel the before day which resulted in many of the vps clients having their services down and what does he do about it? HE GOES ON A LITERAL VACATION!


He doesn't even care about his customers!
He later says he blocked my sys admin when we were literally stressed about our Minecraft host as our clients were complaining about the service being offline. I was at my worst at that time as it was very depressing.

He later talks about compensation if the issue wasn't fixed in a week


he then says "If its not fixed this week it will be 2 months."
I was pretty fine with that, I tried to move on and understand him and waited. 
Guess what...
I never received the required help


and when I ask about the compensation, he shows attitude saying "Don't know what you are trying to get by dmming me, e-mail aiden@xeroz.tech directly"
That was the last convo we had with Patric/wicktor.

Now aiden. I really thought he wanted to help but he was just wasting our time.
He asked me for the vps IP and I provide it to him and then he says this


very funny ^^
I show him a pic of the IP and then he decides to not reply for 2 days


then he says this

Before I continue let me tell you that he did some changes to the vps panel the before day which resulted in many of the vps clients having their services down and what does he do about it? HE GOES ON A LITERAL VACATION!


He doesn't even care about his customers!
He later says he blocked my sys admin when we were literally stressed about our Minecraft host as our clients were complaining about the service being offline. I was at my worst at that time as it was very depressing.

He later talks about compensation if the issue wasn't fixed in a week


he then says "If its not fixed this week it will be 2 months."
I was pretty fine with that, I tried to move on and understand him and waited. 
Guess what...
I never received the required help


and when I ask about the compensation, he shows attitude saying "Don't know what you are trying to get by dmming me, e-mail aiden@xeroz.tech directly"
That was the last convo we had with Patric/wicktor.

Now aiden. I really thought he wanted to help but he was just wasting our time.
He asked me for the vps IP and I provide it to him and then he says this


very funny ^^
I show him a pic of the IP and then he decides to not reply for 2 days


then he says this


Not helpful guys
Now he literally tells us to reinstall!!


Now that's just bad company service, I was ASSURED that there would be 0% dataloss 


yet it happened.
I reply back showing him that I'm unable to ssh into the vps and he tells me to try again!


Now here's the funny part

My VPS is suspended as the bill was overdue as I didn't pay for it at that time. I'm gonna tell you what I told him.
I was promised 2 months compensation
The vps was down for 2 weeks so I've been waiting for a fix and compensation so I didn't pay it.
Now he starts talking about the invoice where Patrick/wicktor had created a new invoice for me in the past so I can renew the vps and use it to start my mc host



I thought he was talking about the present invoice and I tell him that I was promised compensation so give it to me


Now he starts talking about the old expired invoice again



I finally understand at that time and explained to him here so he can understand


Here's the ultimate scam, He gives me only 17 days compensation, not what patrick agreed to give.
He pretty much just asks for the IP &amp; pass &amp; ignores me after that. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-08-23/1692786360-482786-image.png
arrowtan - xeroz.tech was good only for 2 months.
I first had a vps with them in India location for my Minecraft server and it ran well. It often overloaded as I ran multiple servers and it pretty much just lagged my Minecraft server and nothing much.
Later I renewed the VPS to start a MC hosting so I could provide Minecraft servers in India. 
Here are some pics before I explain






he repeatedly blamed us for the often crashes


I even showed him that we're not using much CPU and something is triggering high CPU from their side


I told him this yet he never replied to this


I knew he was lying as I ran 3-4 Minecraft servers previously before starting a host and they all used nearly 600%+ and even on overload they never crashed, they basically used to just get laggy and kick all players like every normal server.
We had multiple crashes 
This is where it happened


Our VPS went down for over 2 weeks and at the first day I asked for priority support and said I was interested in paying but he never replied back on that


he asked for my vps IP and never replied back regarding it, later when I tried to get back he claims he isn't free on weekends.
Later I contact him the next day and he claims to be on a break!

arrowtan - I was stupid enough to trust such a vps host to run a mc host
ast3risk - @arrowtan Please embed your images, I'm not opening all these damn links.



It's this little button right here. (or drag and drop images) - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-08-23/1692786122-725857-image.png
arrowtan - ast3risk hey sorry about that, I started doing that the next minute. I think its all done. You can view it now 🙂
PadowYT2 - hey arrowtan :wave:
ast3risk - arrowtan Maybe he was using consumer VPS nodes for other things
arrowtan - ast3risk well whatever it was, He did something to it and it was weird for it to randomly crash when we barely used the CPU percent also as there's a CPU limit, it should just limit the usage rather than crashing. And all we ran was pterodactyl and paymenter. It wasn't something that would crash the VPS easily while the mc servers on the panel were barely using any CPU %%
ast3risk - arrowtan In the future use real hosting providers (large corporations), not some small-ass shit company that will go bankrupt 😉.
arrowtan - ast3risk Ya I moved to OVH when we lost our data.
ast3risk - arrowtan 👍️
ast3risk - though they did suffer some fires: https://fireproof.ovh
Iris - I was using this to host my minecraft server price was best ive seen but the downtime thay had is something i did not like. thankfully i got files back and did not lose anything
SoSad - Ngl if my vps wouldve been down for longer than even 4 days I would've requested a refund or filed a chargeback
