Deleted User - Proof that samm did it:



The start:
Got a dm from my bot saying this


I got some dms from one of his alts but I forgot the name of that one so I cant get screenshots

Later on



Part 2 of the backdoor:

About an hour after this when everything is back up 
Not sure in which order this happened in but
Our bot token was regenerated so we could bring the Sryden bot back online, it was then used to kick over 600 members from the discord (My staff will talk about this in the thread when I send them the link)
Servers start vanishing from the panel, proof is below


Day later a site is made with all our stuff for download
Link is https://shittysryden.tk/

Deleted User - Some screenshots r in wrong order
Deleted User - Top one should be near the bottom
Zack - Hia, yeah I'm the manager of sryden, I do approve that happened, 
But uh- we did get way more security so nodes should not be hacked in any way
MicroBot - Heyo even though syrden is not the best (in my opinion), this is still not right you should get more security and be strict to staff about rules and not leaking stuff.
Deleted User - For more proof he did it just ask someone in the wh discord
Deleted User - Oh well samm has done other bad shit too - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-02-04/1612464225-506435-screenshot-20210204-184316.png
eraters - sam was not included in that. palpatine token logged and palp gave sam owner role
rip - But ok we get it but. Who asked?
SamCo - Then sam posted an announcement about him and palp being new owners of the host so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
eraters - SamCo just remember, throughout the entire time, palpatine was using sam
J0SH - srydencloud go brrrrr
eraters - not this though
eraters - palp did not use sam through this
Vanquish - J0SH shithost go brrrrr
Deleted User - J0SH no actually everything is up and running
u would have known if you had gone to https://cp.srydencloud.com/
eraters - badsk so you can log our ip and ddos us?
Deleted User - Trash went back to its place.
In the trashcan.
MCKingSam - I have one thing to say.

Lmao.
eraters - sam look in your discord dms
Deleted User - eraters no i dont hav ur ip
eraters - so you're saying that dashactyl doesnt log ips (which i know it does)
Deleted User - Where tf is it logged then
Z4YD - Vanquish the only thing shit is your life
eraters - badsk I don't think I wanna tell you
Z4YD - eraters they don't log ip's because bad didn't install the ip logger
MCKingSam - lmao I'm so glad I did this. someone needed to teach you a lesson, and that person was me. You're welcome &lt;3
eraters - i like how sam is just chill with it lmao
SamCo - eraters As someone who works on dashactyl, i can confirm it does log ips IF you have the anti alt setting enabled.
Jedrik - Isn't this just karma KEKW
Deleted User - @23#5849 database.sqlite in your files...
Deleted User - Z4YD Yeah they do, all pterodactyl logs has ips in it..

Bxrk - ayo sam stupid
Two - mituishere nah, he's wrong... if it were that, i'd be nuking rapidhost when it existed, because samm used to be actual sh*t (he's... somewhat ok now)
Bxrk - nice
