mentalist - I hope the screenshots say it all. Not even days after my initial interaction with the owner, he came to me asking for 40 dollars which is the price of his dedi. Not only but he also asked another member of staff to buy things such as panel for him, and took all credit whilst practically forcing his team to pay for his host. Images are in no particular order. After my confronting him about so and so he cleared customer support chat in hope nobody else would see anything. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-05-11/1683837788-354765-img-4008.png

Robman - So heres my response. 

The other owner agreed to pay for the server because i spent most money on toqi which was for billing. Also the theme was because then i did not have a payment gateway they could use for their vps 

Also i used money that i got from my other service which was reselling products for the theme


I also paid for the discord bot etc. 

I asked him and i would give it back. 

Also it was community support channel and it wasnt to "hide" anything but to remove stuff that wasnt for the right channel. 

Heres the proof that they didnt pay for everything - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-05-12/1683903166-649518-lhcbw.png

Sydney - You know, I kind of expected better. The blurring out of the name means you could have easily "asked" your alt...
