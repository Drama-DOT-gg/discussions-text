ClydeNoIQ - Graitexity (Clxudd), has been caught red-handed trying to steal artwork from one of our dear friends. And for what, you may ask? Well, apparently this shady character wanted to remove our friend's watermark and claim the artwork as his own.

But the drama doesn't end there, folks. Oh no, it gets even juicier. It turns out that this same Graitexity (Clxudd) is now running some kind of scam associated with the Donut SMP Minecraft server. Can you believe the audacity of this guy?

We strongly advise everyone to steer clear of this Graitexity (Clxudd). We're talking some seriously shady business going on here, folks. So if you want to avoid being caught up in the drama, be sure to stay far away from this individual and any schemes he may be running. Trust us, it's not worth the risk.
