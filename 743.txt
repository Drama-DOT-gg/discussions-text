samxd - Why was I muted? I smell censorship. I never see anyone with common opinions muted, just because I stated mine, doesn't mean I should be muted.
Jedrik - samxd I'd understand if it were all jokes and shit, but being homophobic in general, shoving it in our throats, offending people, etc. that's just uncool. Keep your opinion to your self, no one cares about your opinions just like how you care about other people's genders. You're so annoyed by LGBT people shoving their gender in your throat when you're out here shoving your opinion to people who don't care, the chat isn't for this. Yes, you're being censored, our chat isn't the place to be sharing your stand on LGBTQ+




This right here,

You're generalizing the whole movement as this news you've seen all over the internet cause you're cool and hip like that. None of these people who raided stores, etc. knew what the movement was about nor even cared, or supported it. They were just taking advantage of the situation. Please sam, after all of these years your brain still hasn't developed? Embarrassing. Keep your opinion to your self or share it somewhere else.

I know, I may have said some controversial shit before, but that was all as a joke, it was satire and ironic and I've made it clear before. 

You're calling for more attention than the people in this community who are LGBTQ+, please just shut the fuck up. You're worse than the people you keep shitting on about, if you hate an LGBTQ+ person irl, don't share the negativity here, the people who are LGBTQ+ in this community are actually pretty chill. But your close-minded head in your ass can't proccess that. They were supressed for many years, and you know that, for what? Having an opinion on THEIR OWN gender? Exactly. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-01/1625106741-578295-image.png

Jedrik - I approved this because I'm giving you a chance to talk and explain your self.
