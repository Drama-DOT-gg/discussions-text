Matteo - So, yesterday i ordered a vps at a dutch hosting( not gonna say the name), 
Which the owner had my client info talking about( First, Last names, adress etc.) 
And me the toxic cunt i am i start misbehaving in his discord and called one of his staff a 'Cancer sandnigger' because he was acting all tough. Then the owner dm's me and says wanna talk dude and i said 4x no, suddenly he pulls up my dads name pops him a message and he was like yeah im informing your parents about your behaviour online. But he got my info FROM HIS client panel which really should not be allowed or is this me?
