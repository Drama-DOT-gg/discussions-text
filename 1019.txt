Mocab - QloxHost about the data loss I agree but the nodes lagging? maybe attach some proof
Giyu - isnt that breach/loss ages ago?
Giyu - and lamaker have reported it to ico have proof but dont want to leak dm, so  if any staff of drama.gg want to see it dm me ig
Chirag - Giyu no, the data protection fee was paid, pretty sure the data breach wasn't reported
Giyu - Chirag i can show dm if u want btw
Mocab - Giyu no not that, he is talking about hetzner taking down nodes and users losing their data
Deleted User - Giyu oooooh yaaaaah discord messages = 100% valid proof - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-09-20/1632166153-475882-image.png
BrendansAtWork - Mocab haha wasn't it funny how I advised on exactly how an attack could occur with the data provided available to me, he said there were no issues "other people run companies like this just fine" and then was attacked with the exact poc I gave which took me like 20 minutes to do

i dm'ed him after and said haha bet you regret not listening to wait i advised and he has ignored me since ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž

mf was actively aware of the issues at hand which could result in a breach, i gave them up openly in the sake of disclosure so i could get some of his time 

ended up not only rejecting us but also plain blank ignoring the free advice i gave him which he should act on "urgently" else he'd end up in an attack
Mocab - BrendansAtWork yeah it does take a while to convince lamaker but he has gotten abit better
dchu096 - oh yeah extra note: im sure inside their ptero the right click is kinda jammed!
Mocab - dchu096 wdym?
