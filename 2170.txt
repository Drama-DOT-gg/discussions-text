PadowYT2 - cant say anything bout it, but can just say they are using a leaked theme and im just gonna take actions against them
GreenFruit - PadowYT2 Leaked theme???
Hmmmmm - If they dont have a tos or privacy policy just dont use their service + i dont think really anyone cares if they dont have a tos or privacy policy
PadowYT2 - GreenFruit dw about it, it is not there now
GreenFruit - PadowYT2 I can see that, they deleted all data ðŸ’€
saad_47 - PadowYT2 wth we changed  our theme
PadowYT2 - saad_47 i know, my reply was 5 days ago, also kinda you changed to an another theme that is from directleaks/blackspigot
arnain - Everything thing is back up and now we aren't using any theme
arnain - PadowYT2 nah we aren't using any theme now 
and many other host are also using that theme 
Idk why no one tells anything to them
PadowYT2 - arnain because they are probably running not a leaked version?
arnain - PadowYT2 hmm
