RumGuru - Hi everyone
Just wanted to write this thread mostly because of shams acting.
He has a host that is called "OTA Hosting - Europe" its a paid host that uses free domain - "otahosting.ga".
It has no privacy policy or terms of service and it has been working for 4 days already.
They are lying about having i9 nodes, which they dont - ik that because shams was broke when he was opening one other host like a week or 2 ago. And plans in theri host are like this "i9 nodes are budget and intel xeon are premium lol"
Picture 1 - 
Also when i asked where is tos and privacy, their manager responded " may i know why does this concern you, we arent even scamming people" - lol like they what should they do scam people tf lol.
Picture 2 -
And shams(owner) also says legal documents arent important
Picture 3 - 
Later i asked for proof that he has i9 nodes
Picture 4 - 
Picture 5 - 
Then i wanted to kind of trick him to show me proof of having i9 nodes so i said if he shows me that i will buy server lol
Picture 6 - 
Then he said he will show me in pterodactly panel, which you cant show any proof of specification of nodes
Picture 7 - 

After that i stopped screenshoting, but i was trying to get him to show me real proof of having i9 nodes.
And then i got banned for no reason, their reason was probably : "asking stupid questions" lol
Im 99% sure they use velocitynode.net vps budget plan, because shams wanted to purchase that for his old host.

So we can all agree that having a paid or free host on free domain is retarded, and having no privacy policy or tos, and lying about having good nodes.

At the moment there is a new owner ThunderX, i think he will fix host, so dont hate on him.

ShamsPlays - Heyo, I am sorry about your experience with me but uhh, You're quite rude yourself. I don't want to start an argument here or anything but, Thank you for your suggestions. We will use these to build our selves up. thank you.
RumGuru - ShamsPlays i am not but ok.
You should start an argument because you work ilegaly and you lied to your customers about nodes.
And also eh idk about building your host up because you already ruined it
ShamsPlays - RumGuru All of my customers know I don't have i9
RumGuru - ShamsPlays Well you said that you do
ShamsPlays - I lied specifically to you because of my past with you. You legit hate every one of my decision. I don't want to be criticized. I just don't like it.
ShamsPlays - RumGuru Nope, ask everyone of em
RumGuru - ShamsPlays lol you are lying, me and you barely have any dms lmao
you are using a free domain for a paid host, lying about nodes, no documents so you should be criticized lmao
ShamsPlays - RumGuru Criticized for using a free domain?, bitch please. I don't have my dad's money to spend like you
ShamsPlays - RumGuru How about you tell me, when you asked me to make you a free logo whilst having "money" and a domain
RumGuru - ShamsPlays First of all im broke lol, i never used my parents money to spend it on internet stuff, and who is stupid enough to open host with a free domain lmao
Yie - ShamsPlays cmon man, a .xyz costs just $1. it's not that expensive. you afford to "pay" for the nodes, but you can't afford a fucking domain
ShamsPlays - RumGuru First of all, We just released like 4 days ago, I ran out of money whilst buying nodes so please
ShamsPlays - Yie Bruh, You don't know about my country's currency
Yie - ShamsPlays which country is it?
ShamsPlays - Yie btw, i did buy a xyz domain for my other hosting server which didn't take off
RumGuru - ShamsPlays Lmao you wanted me to buy you a node in exchange for pfp - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-28/1622236287-132931-8.jpg
RumGuru - ShamsPlays And how do you explain having no legal documents and lying about nodes?
ShamsPlays - RumGuru Yeah, thats after I made you the logo. I was tired of making u logos
Yie - ShamsPlays didn't take off

didn't take off?
RumGuru - ShamsPlays You made me one and it was bad, i didnt even use it
ShamsPlays - Yie I meant, no one bought it
RumGuru - ShamsPlays And who is stupid enough to ask for a node in exchange for a pfp lmao
RumGuru - ShamsPlays You scammed your customers kidn off, you lied about your nodes
Yie - ShamsPlays ooo, and yeah, which country you're in? i wanna check their currency stuff
ShamsPlays - RumGuru how? they already know about the xeons
ShamsPlays - check yourself, we already had wrote Xeon, I lied to @RumGuru because I know he would make fun of what i had - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-28/1622236462-611301-image.png
RumGuru - ShamsPlays i wouldnt make fun of you having xeon nodes but ok.
But still how do you explain no documents?
thats like the most important thing in host
ShamsPlays - RumGuru I was gonna implement those into my Website.
RumGuru - ShamsPlays You already work for 4 days and you have customers, you shouldnt even open without documents bruh
ShamsPlays - RumGuru I didn't know until you told me, I am already working on the documents
RumGuru - ShamsPlays if you dont know that you shouldnt open a host........
ShamsPlays - We all are humans, we all make mistakes
RumGuru - ShamsPlays Tip 1: if you dont know how to manage/open host, dont open one.
Simple as it sounds!
ShamsPlays - How will I know how to make a host if I am just starting.
ShamsPlays - Yie Pakistan
ShamsPlays - ShamsPlays Also, the .host aren't for around 1 USD, If there are sites that provide a .host domain please lmk. I've been looking for a domain since last night
xgamer_tn - RumGuru So you are saying if somoene want to learn to do something but dont know how . He should just give up ??
xgamer_tn - I dont think thats a good advice
RumGuru - xgamer_tn learn before you open!
xgamer_tn - RumGuru he is learning
and you are just ruining
RumGuru - xgamer_tn scroll up and find Tip 1
Lmao
Cain - xgamer_tn No, But looking into what is required first is always a good start. This stops people like RumGuru coming in and causing issues like this
KylePlays - Ayo? Wtf I didn't get invited 🤣
KylePlays - Guru!?!?
RumGuru - KylePlays invited to what exactly?
ShamsPlays - Koisip What's wrong with my status
AlphaDarky - RumGuru Also when i asked where is tos and privacy, their manager responded " may i know why does this concern you, we arent even scamming people" - lol like they what should they do scam people tf lol.

ShamsPlays - AlphaDarky This proves them wrong. We've been working on the ToS since the day the host opened.
RumGuru - ShamsPlays Dont lie bruh, in one of screenshots you said that you didnt even know you need tos
lmaooooooo
ShamsPlays - RumGuru I didn't need it but Alpha had told me to make a ToS when I was starting the Host
RumGuru - ShamsPlays You are just big liar, you didnt even know you need documents when i asked you lmao
Deleted User - "Who needs TOS"

lol
AlphaDarky - ShamsPlays i did tell him
Koisip - ShamsPlays I just think it's ironic lol
ShamsPlays - He tried to blackmail me, He first asked me to make him Manager and then when my friend removed his role, He told me to give it back and I told him to ask the guy who removed his role, He tried to blackmail me indirectly by saying "I will ask the admin to confirm the post". Rum is trying to be so innocent. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-29/1622320126-627923-image.png
ShamsPlays - btw, He deleted the message where he said "Make me manager" after I confronted him about that hes sus, An admin of mine (AlphaDarky) told me about his plan to winterhoax my server. After I told him about what AlphaDarky said, He immediately removed his messages and told 

me he was only going to "help" me. Just imagine trying to play the innocent card in a thread. You legit deleted your messages and tried to indirectly blackmail me - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-29/1622320459-920247-image.png

RumGuru - ShamsPlays first of all thats not blackmailing.
I asked you if i can help because you apologised to me.
I really wanted to help host and make it good.
Then you removed my role and i was confused, and you said im not getting it back.
I wanted to lock thread and helo you, but now that i see that you are just a big scammer and big liar i dont want to.
And yes i asked admins to confirm post, they said they will revieve it.
RumGuru - ShamsPlays i didnt say make me manager after you demoted me, i said will i get back role.
You said no and i said ok.
And i said i will continue the thread and get it confirmed.
My plan was not to winterhoax you my plan was to help host to fix all atiff and get it better, alphy is just a stupid guy.
And also i didnt delete a single message from our dms.
You actually did dm me smth couple of times and deleted it.
ShamsPlays - Instead of being rude, I invited him back. He lied about "I wanted to say in the thread that im gonna help you fix stuff, and that admins can close the thread but ok never mind". He tried so hard. He even asked for Panel access because he wanted to "help me". Rum is pretty rude, I worked with him on my older hosting, I made a guy owner because He was willing to run the host. Rum was so rude that the guy voted to kick him out. He was kicked out of the staff team x3 and when we were planning to buy nodes, he would make jokes about us buying the nodes. We had our nodes getting delayed, he made so much fun of the idea that we're getting nodes. No one in my older server liked him because of his rude and aggressive behavior. I had a fight with my friend ThunderX and he was supporting ThunderX and I had a fight with him aswell, The reason I got rude with him in the first place was because we had a fight and I had hatred for him because he chose Thunder. Me and thunder got back to being friends and I made him the owner of OTAHosting but Rum couldn't stand it, so he decided to make a Drama.gg post so Thunder would eventually leave me because of the thread. I just don't like the idea of this guy being so jealous. He would always flex in my older hosting on how much he got, how much nodes he had and how much developed his host was. I don't believe this kid tries to be innocent by not telling the true story, If you want to come on Drama.gg, please tell your own past with me to others. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-29/1622320609-992451-image.png
RumGuru - And also dont talk how i am a bud guy when you are literaly scammer/liar/toxic/doing illegal stuff
ShamsPlays - RumGuru Hes stupid because he caught you? Bitch please, the guy you were supporting demoted you right in front of my eyes, Even thunderx doesn't trust you because we already knew what your intentions were. btw, How were you going to improve the server by getting access to our domain and staff panel? Please tell, I am dying to hear your lame coverups.
RumGuru - ShamsPlays hahaha i never said i have million nodes i had like 1 node on my host and i didnt even opwn that host.
I started to make drama.gg thread even before ik thunder became owner
RumGuru - ShamsPlays do you have proof that i was rude to you, no you dont, you were actually rude to me and you were toxic.
You demoted me from old host and later thunder invited me back.....
RumGuru - ShamsPlays i wanted to make website for you.
I never didnt want to do anthying bad because im not a raider and i dont destroy hosts like that.
And also wow being toxic again noice
That just shows of your personality.
And alphy is stupid, not just because of this he is stupid since i know him!
ShamsPlays - RumGuru So, Not having a ToS and Privacy policy whilst starting a Host is illegal, Its not like I am smoking weed, How am i toxic please tell me... Legit everyone in my Discord had a bad experience with you, which is why the whole team made another group just to get rid of you. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-29/1622321440-516904-image.png

ShamsPlays - RumGuru Do you have any actual proof that I deleted my messages, I haven't touched our dms, I only blocked you thats it. I asked for a website because It was going to make me a lot of time to make one. I never begged you, I kindly asked you to remove it... any guy who has logical sense would know that Its better talking than taking it publicly unless you're a Rumguru.
RumGuru - ShamsPlays lol if i was still in that discord i could find so much proof of you swearing at me and everyone else.
And also your people hate me and your people are like thunder and alphy lmao.
And also dont forget that you ran scamm discord server that was scamming people for minecraft alts lol
RumGuru - ShamsPlays nop you begged me

And you were toxic in dms.
And i cantget proof of you deleting because im not using message logger lmao
ShamsPlays - RumGuru I never banned you from anywhere, I only kicked you because you don't know how to talk to a Staff Member
ShamsPlays - RumGuru Do you have actual proof of me scamming people? I legit got proof of me giving things to people.
ShamsPlays -  - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-29/1622322164-420436-image.png
RumGuru - ShamsPlays you banned me like 3 or 2 times from volcanic nodes.
You banned me from ota host.
And now you banned me again from volcanic nodes.
RumGuru - ShamsPlays i boosted that server  and i never received my accounts......
ShamsPlays - RumGuru Well, If you got no proof, you got nothin' You're just making accusations. I am talking with actual proof so please stfu

RumGuru - ShamsPlays also being toxic again?
ShamsPlays - First of all, thats me and thunder fighting over the VPs, the staff team told me that I chose the wrong vps provider prohoster.info and that I shouldn't choose ever again. They teamed up on me and said very bad things, what do you expect me to do?
ShamsPlays - RumGuru I have 100 more ss
RumGuru - ShamsPlays bruh you are lying 
They didnt team up they were just mad because you messed up.
And also they didnt swear as much as you did.
And you were the first one that started to swesr.

ShamsPlays - RumGuru I already said sorry to them and they're okay. May I ask how does me fighting with my staff affect you in any way?

ThunderX - Hello! I am ThunderX 2nd owner of the OTA Hosting so you guys are saying that we have a free domain? Okay so why does a free domain matter? We can use any domain we want who are u to stop us? 2nd we bought a .xyz domain. And then someone is saying that we are using vultr free vps trial I am sorry but that ip Shams gave u guys is not that one the real ip for our vps is 94.130.100.11 this vps is from velocity and no tos &amp; pp? I am sorry for that we made that tos &amp; pp now so that is fixed now if u still have any issues from us we can clear them for u and fix everything. This is our first hosting service so we are learning as we go. Thanks...
ThunderX - Still dont trust us with the velocity nodes? ever heard of a command called ping built in your windows? yea try that - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-30/1622349695-878772-image.png

AlphaDarky - RumGuru hmm ok
FranXis - ThunderX Well, you dont made this TOS, u can stop lying??

Here is screenshot of proof they stealed it - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-30/1622382480-696875-unknown-2.png
FranXis - Can someone close this? I think all is fixed
ShamsPlays - RumGuru uhh, you sure? newer documents aren't copied

We legit used a generator and added some of our own terms

btw, who the fuck uses ghosty, I've used it. Once of the worst vps providers ever, It was first owned by ryder now idk
ShamsPlays - RumGuru stealed? please learn some grammar first before posting a thread
ShamsPlays - RumGuru We got privacy policy, could you do some research einstein?
Tomas - ShamsPlays Ghosty works fine, under different management
ThunderX - Tomas Yes it works fine
RumGuru - ShamsPlays they were copied at first, later after franxis said he will post it in thread yo lu begged him no.....
ThunderX - Also i have told u everything i had to tell u and this should be resolved now, still have any problems please let me know
RumGuru - ShamsPlays you say ghosty is trash because you use ghosty budget.
Ghosty premium is really good vps

ThunderX - But i didnt knew that friends like u exist too so now i am gonna be careful 🙂
RumGuru - ThunderX yes shams is scammer

RumGuru - ThunderX

RumGuru - ThunderX i never did anthying bad to you....
I made thos thread for shams
You hated shams but after he gave you role in his host you forgive him lmao.
You didnt even know about his host until i told you....
ThunderX - RumGuru Yea these words u deserved because of exposing private dms
ThunderX - RumGuru Yea but i fixed everything now then why u still being like this?
RumGuru - ThunderX shams owns it to and he is a bad guy....
ThunderX - RumGuru As long as i am owner he is not the BAD guy
RumGuru - ThunderX i suggest you to make host on your own.
Shams doesnt know anthying about hosts lmao
He  literaly said that....
ThunderX - RumGuru u just dont want my host to succeed dont u? because i unfriended u and removed u as staff on my both hosts which one of em didnt start
ThunderX - RumGuru Shams has owned a host before
RumGuru - ThunderX i didnt expose our dms until now lmao?
What are you talking about?
ThunderX - I would make my own host if i had any payment method and i dont wanna start a host alone
ThunderX - RumGuru u did expose shams dms didnt u?
RumGuru - ThunderX you still use bad nodes and shams is still owner  if shams wasnt owner i would stop tslking in this thread...
RumGuru - ThunderX no, i dont actually care about your hostin being good  or no.
I just care that shams is owner of it
ThunderX - RumGuru Yes we use bad nodes but we are providing cheap hosting as well and all our customers are getting 20 tps and they are satisfied
RumGuru - ThunderX yes  but he still doesnt know anthying about hosts
In that host you did everthying
ThunderX - We will be upgrading our nodes if we get more good customers and enough money to buy new nodes but if u are gonna be like this then we are going nowhere we will be stuck with these nodes
RumGuru - ThunderX yea but that means nothing to you i didnt expise our dms, until now?
RumGuru - ThunderX 1$/gb is not cheap for velocity vps
ThunderX - RumGuru He will be better as he goes trust me...
ThunderX - RumGuru Umm for now we sold all servers for 0.40 per gb
RumGuru - ThunderX like i said if shams wasnt owner, i wouldnt care about your nodes and stuff.....
RumGuru - ThunderX ik him for a wile and i dont think he will go better
He was toxic in old host and he is toxic now.
Hr scammed in his rewards server and he scammed now lmao......
ThunderX - RumGuru If you care about Shams then i dont really care i will still be continuing this host
ThunderX - RumGuru wait how did he scam u?
RumGuru - ThunderX prices alwere listed 1$/gb 
So yea you are lying 
I see that both you and shams are big  liars.....
RumGuru - ThunderX in his rewards mc account server i boosted and never got accounts
I shouldve got mfa and sfa
And his scammed his customers in ota host by saying that he has i9 nodes which is a lie
ThunderX - RumGuru We gave 0.40$ vps for now because of new host sale
ThunderX - You can ask our customers that
RumGuru - ThunderX it said 1$/gb before, now it says 0.80$/gb
ThunderX - RumGuru forgot to change that because our hosting is 0.80$ per gb and because of the new host sale we made 50% off but i think its over now and we will cost people 0.80 pergb now
RumGuru - ThunderX tbh thats still bad because you use velocity budget plans....
There are many hosts that are cheap/cheaper and use like amd ryzen, i9,i7.....
ThunderX - RumGuru Bro if our customer want to buy they can if they dont they wont
RumGuru - ThunderX can i suggest them better hosts?
jk i wont
ThunderX - RumGuru no thats just called advertising and its against our server rules
RumGuru - ThunderX i said i wont.....
ThunderX - Also Shams never made a MFA server he just worked for one
ThunderX - RumGuru lol ok
RumGuru - ThunderX he was supplier so he shouldve give accounts, i didnt receive one and thats a scam.............
ThunderX - RumGuru that not him scamming that the owner scamming 😂
RumGuru - ThunderX bruh he was supplier, that means he had accounts......
RumGuru - Even his manager thinks that he is dumb lmao...... - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-31/1622456633-918438-20210531-122251.jpg
FranXis - ShamsPlays Again with the fuck*** TOS, i made my tos i dont generated it
AlphaDarky - RumGuru Mind also telling which server that is and the back story (calling him that for tos stuff) which rum clearly *DIDNTmention
RumGuru - AlphaDarky rolledhost and  we were talking about ota and shams.....
AlphaDarky - RumGuru i was talking about the stuff he said about tos in rolled host sorry that you didn't pick up
RumGuru - AlphaDarky k then
Tom - Seems they are hosting clients on a Velocity Node VPS. (Traceroute of their IPv4 address shows this as it is Hetzner)
EestiMngur - Tom sus
RumGuru - Shams just purged messages because people were saying that host uses velocity and that its bad lmao
RumGuru - Banned me for saying
"purge incoming................."
Ryder - I the owner of velocity node myself don't recommend using velocity node's budget VPS for game hosting and for starting a host using budget VPS from velocity node is a no no.
You can atleast purchase a plus plan which is r5 3600 and costs 25 cents more than a budget server or deluxe which costs a little more but with a i9 9900k.


here is the pinned message in our support discord server^

Using velocity nodes budget lineup to start a game hosting company is not a great idea and on top of that trashing velocity node for being bad is even more trash idea. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-02/1622604514-654171-image.png
RumGuru - Hmm they fixed tos and pp i guess
https://tinyurl.com/otaprivacypolicy

AlphaDarky - @RumGuru uh u suck at hiding alts - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-09/1623254124-280316-image.png
RumGuru - AlphaDarky I have alts in your discord, that one isnt one of them lol

RumGuru - ThunderX yes i said that.
Also dont you say me about acting bad lmao.
You runned illegal host and you scammed people with shams.
Also what do you have to say abour removing Pterodactly copyright?
ShamsPlays - We have moved to contabo for the betterment of our customers. We're moving customers to our contabo vps as speak.
ShamsPlays - We're going to be using vps from velocity for hosting our website and some databases
RumGuru - ShamsPlays Contabo is also bad. Better then Velocity but still bad!
ShamsPlays - man I don't understand you
ShamsPlays - btw, I got the 30 GB one with 8 vcores
RumGuru - ShamsPlays intel epyc lol
Thats still bad kinda
jeekie - There's no such thing as intel epyc btw
RumGuru - jeekie uf yes its amd epyc lol
HenryH - @ShamsPlays Mind explaining this? Like, why are you stealing/removing copyrighted trademarks...?

HenryH
Seer - HenryH Filling onto your statement, Henry:

 Please consider giving trademark/copyright to the rightful owner of the theme, it is straight up rude to steal from an open-source project, since you can just get it without any trouble. This can cause for a lot of trouble if they find out.
Plus don't tell people to kill themselfs.
RumGuru - HenryH Because he is a dumb kid
xgamer_tn - fight still going XD
xgamer_tn - RumGuru Contabo isnt bad
xgamer_tn - i ran a server on it
HenryH - xgamer_tn No, not really. I used a host before that used Contabo and it was fine. No problems with it.
RumGuru - xgamer_tn contabo isnt bad, but it also isn t good!
HenryH - RumGuru You do not make sense, why are you thinking something is good and bad at the same time, you keep switching your opinion based on others opinions. At this point your just trying everything in your power to overpower him/shit on him basically, no one deserves it, he learned his lesson. enough.
AlphaDarky - HenryH He doesn't care if we learned or not if we fixed our issues he just wants us to close or become a meme.
RumGuru - AlphaDarky you already are meme lol
AlphaDarky - RumGuru nope
RumGuru - AlphaDarky yep  lol
ShamsPlays - Seer uh ok
RumGuru - ThunderX oo forgot to reply to this
Your manager said that i should kill myself and you laughed.
Lmao
AlphaDarky - RumGuru ah yes forget the part your racist and said to me die faggot
RumGuru - AlphaDarky never told you that wtf?
Show me screenshot?
AlphaDarky - RumGuru left the group might ask someone else who was once in it
RumGuru - AlphaDarky okay, ask now.
I never said anthying like that lmao
Im not like you...
RumGuru - Here is link to their discord
https://discord.gg/5e7aTPS4VS
HenryH - Shit host, they banned swearing as they think "all hosts on discord don't allow swearing" so they have the shittiest bot ever on their server and it doesn't even work. The staff member who added it (AlphaDarky) was quite an idiot. 2/10.
Yie - HenryH pretty sure lots of hosts doesn't really mind people swearing
ShamsPlays - Rebranding everything from the start to resolve issues
RumGuru - ShamsPlays you dont know how to run a host, so better just give up.
ShamsPlays - RumGuru At this point, You don't actually have an issue with the host. You just don't want us beating up your "valence host" and your other 99 hosts which you failed to start
ShamsPlays - RumGuru I won't give up unlike you did on your raided host or whatever that was
RumGuru - ShamsPlays Valence is my second host.
Never owned any others.
I do have issues because you guys are still liars and dumb kids
RumGuru - ShamsPlays You did give up, you owned host before, Volcanic Nodes lmao
You just left host and let thunder deal with it
ShamsPlays - All I know is that everyone whom you've worked with at Volcanic saw you as a toxic kid who just likes to brag about what he has achieved or just mock us because we weren't able to get nodes on the right time
ShamsPlays - RumGuru I never left, We just abandoned Volcanic Nodes. As VolcanicNodes was a failure due to me buying the vps from a OVZ provider. I decided to make my own hosting and then I brought the main volcanic staff onboard except you.
ShamsPlays - RumGuru You own around 20 domains with .host. quit lying
RumGuru - ShamsPlays You were "getting" a node for half a year lmao
And also you were the most toxic person in volcanic nodes.
I never was toxic there.
RumGuru - ShamsPlays are you dumb?
i have only valence.host and sparknodes.xyz lmao
and those are 2 hosts that i owned
Raided host just changed domain to sparknodes because i wasnt owner of domain
quit lying kid
ShamsPlays - RumGuru Oh you weren't, wow you're actually good at lying. Just gonna wait for thunder to get on so I can actually prove that you were toxic. I remember having a third owner onboard who had just recently joined and even he thought of you as toxic so he removed you as staff and you literally I mean literally begged him to let you back into staff chat
RumGuru - ShamsPlays Show me proof and then we will talk...
ShamsPlays - RumGuru How would I know you didn't own Raidedhost's domain? plus You did own Raided and theres no way you could deny that. I can also say that Volcanic is OTA but the domain is changed
ShamsPlays - Also, I found the MidNight theme on a forum, I didn't know who owned it or whatever which is why I changed the branding and fyi, I left Pterodactyl logos for a reason
ShamsPlays - RumGuru You too, Provide me with the proof that I was toxic in Volcanic.
RumGuru - ShamsPlays I owned raided host , but domain was owned by Tomas, so i just switched domain to sparknodes.xyz

Volcanic isnt Ota lmao, you left Volcanic and after month you opened new shitty/scammer host called "ota"
RumGuru - ShamsPlays i dont need screens from volcanic, go scroll up a bit and you will see screnshot of you swearing a lot lmao
ShamsPlays - At this point,  You hate the host, whatever I do to resolve this situation you're like "OMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG LEAVE THE HOST OMG DUMB KID1!!!1!! XDDXDXDXD"
RumGuru - ShamsPlays Lmao who cares, you removed ptero "mark"
ShamsPlays - RumGuru We're talking about Volcanic here. so talk about Volcanic 😃
RumGuru - ShamsPlays Yes because you dont know how to run a damn host lmao
RumGuru - ShamsPlays Im talking about Ota and Volcanic....
ShamsPlays - RumGuru How will I know if I don't make a damn host? Please explain
RumGuru - ShamsPlays Maybe work at host?
Investigate a bit.
You literaly didnt know you need legal documents to run a host.
And you lied about nodes and much more.....
Timanttikuutio - ShamsPlays learn Linux administration, business management, etc...
ShamsPlays - What are you tryna say? If you're making mistakes because Its your first time you should quit? Please man, You're talking bs at this point. You're talking as if you own multimillion dollar businesses.
RumGuru - Timanttikuutio or atleast get people that know that and they will help you
You have 2 manager dadcuy and alphy(they dont know anthying about hosts)
And thunder who also doesnt know much about hosts lmao
Get real people or learn yourseld
ShamsPlays - RumGuru I only lied to you for the sole purpose of you not making fun of me. Thunder and my customers know that we're using Intel Xeon
ShamsPlays - RumGuru yk, dadcuy and alphy are your co-workers tf are you tryna say?
RumGuru - ShamsPlays nah, you are working with money, with real people, emails, ips and data.
You need to learn stuff before you open
Opening host is easy, but managing one isnt
And you clearly dont know how to manage host
RumGuru - ShamsPlays Nop you lied to everyone lmao.
RumGuru - ShamsPlays  im saying they dont know anthying about hosts lmao
ShamsPlays - I do know a bit about Linux but I am not really good at business management, I could only learn business management through making my own company or working in one which is why I have created OTA.
ShamsPlays - RumGuru 
How so?
Timanttikuutio - ShamsPlays You should do some research and get people who actually know what they're doing to help before you start a host. Besides, the mc hosting market is already over saturated, way too many hosts
ShamsPlays - RumGuru Do you have actual proof of me telling my customers that my cores are i9 or i7? If you got no proof please don't talk bs
RumGuru - ShamsPlays You created ota without documents.
your host is and it will always be a big joke lmao
Timanttikuutio - RumGuru this^^
ShamsPlays - Timanttikuutio True but Alphy and Dadcuy have worked in numerous hosts.
RumGuru - ShamsPlays you said it in chat multiple times but you banned me so i have no proof...
RumGuru - ShamsPlays Only rolled lmao
ShamsPlays - RumGuru So what? I have fixed those issues... How can you call my host a joke when your own minecraft server was a joke?
ShamsPlays - RumGuru That isn't my issue. Join with an alt see for your self.

ShamsPlays -  - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-28/1624868974-106476-image.png
ShamsPlays - RumGuru Deleted the message? tf you on about? I literally have a logs channel, If i had deleted the message It would've showed up
RumGuru - ShamsPlays bruh that was when this thread started you can delete it easly lmao
ShamsPlays - Wow man. You seriously got some brain damage
RumGuru - ShamsPlays says a kid who cried in my dms to delete/stop this thread lol
ShamsPlays - RumGuru I did because I didn't want to fight you infront of all of these people and to resolve issues before they get bigger
ShamsPlays - Since you like fighting so much you chose to ignore my requests and chose to fight me instead
RumGuru - ShamsPlays by answering here, you made bigger issues to yourself
RumGuru - ShamsPlays I like to fight bad people like you tbh
ShamsPlays - RumGuru bad people, People haven't seen the side of you which I saw. Please keep the fight to yourself. I only said "rebranding everything to resolve issues" but you're so desperate for a fight so you chose to start the thread again
RumGuru - ShamsPlays show me side you saw lmao
i  just dont want other people to get scammed by you or have bad experience lol
and i am giving you the best advice you can get
"close host and learn about it more"
If you even can learn
ShamsPlays - RumGuru first of all my customers know I use xeons and how will I scam them? PayPal doesn't give us the money before 7 days so they can get a refund if the hosting isn't like they thought
ShamsPlays - RumGuru How about you close your mouth and stop lying
RumGuru - ShamsPlays you lied about nodes before, and most people dont know difference betwen xeon and i9 lol
RumGuru - ShamsPlays i aint lying about anthying
ShamsPlays - RumGuru Is that my problem? If they ask me I'll make sure to tell them the difference?
RumGuru - ShamsPlays it is your problem....
ShamsPlays - RumGuru I don't want to talk in this thread anymore, Your argument is wrong, You can't win an argument from a stupid person.
RumGuru - ShamsPlays This whole thread is my argument, and you know that you lost this battle lmao.
Every persone except your friends that messages something in this thread said that im right
RumGuru - ShamsPlays And sure go away
when you get scared you always leave or block lmao
ShamsPlays - RumGuru How did i lose this battle, OTA is still going strong
RumGuru - ShamsPlays Yes ota is going strong with INTEL XEON lol
And also with bad reputation....
ShamsPlays - RumGuru Yep you're actually desperate, what else could have I expected from a retard like you who wastes his parents hard earned money to buy domains for his failed hosts
RumGuru - ShamsPlays Bruh i owned one host before valence lmao.
And i didnt take my parents money lmao, thats so dumb
RumGuru - ShamsPlays And also you actually have 2 failed hosts "ota" and "volcanic"
So yea
ShamsPlays - RumGuru Yk, OTA isn't a failure Its atleast making more sales than your host made in a year
RumGuru - ShamsPlays Ota is the worst paid host tbh.
Paid hosts should use better nodes unlike you
And also my host just opened a week ago lmao
So it isnt running for a year....
Yie - RumGuru I rarely see a paid host uses Intel Xeon tbh.
_MrKnight_ - Yie jeekie's host Singapore budget lines does
Yie - _MrKnight_ oh yea I did say rarely?
_MrKnight_ - Yie well i shown an example
ShamsPlays - Yie  What about Pebble?
ShamsPlays - Yie What about Aquatis.host?
ShamsPlays - Yie What about plox.host?
RumGuru - All those hosts you mentioned are 100% better then yours lmao.
And they actully have website, documents, nice and proffesional people that know how to run a host unlike you and your staff lmao
Yie - I've never heard aquatishost and ploxhost before.
BBB-Complaint - you both r acting like childs.
BBB-Complaint - BBB-Complaint RumGuru is jealous because OTA hosting has decent staff &amp; managed to get a donor node, get some sales, and made some money, &amp; Rumguru was not successful until like 10 trys &amp; was not able to get sales, thats why hes mad and jealous. managed to get a 30gb Contabo node, most people dont like Contabo cuz of ddos protection or something, but they have improved that (b4) &amp; are affordable, but ofc being affordable WILL have SOME flaws. Sham said that Rumguru used to brag about his nodes &amp; stuff in the server, and rumguru is making claims like he used to swear, but he has no proof to back it up! Sham has actually acted professional except for some times, and he is also underaged to be running a hosting company. OTAHosting has not acted professional. Except some people.
Timanttikuutio - BBB-Complaint i wouldn't brag about getting a "donor node" lol, that node could very well be cancelled by the real owner and it is a real security threat. DO NOT use nodes for your business given by others, anyone should be able to understand how dangerous and irresponsible that is. just because you got it for free, doesn't mean they'll keep paying for it just so you can use it, that node could go poof any second
RumGuru - BBB-Complaint Who would be jealous  of bad host lmao.
Ota has bad staff that dont know anthying about hosts.
What 10 yrs lmao?
I dont use Contabo for my host.
Never bragged about my nodes lmao.
I have proof that he sweared, read the whole thread and you will see a lot of screenshots were shams is swearing
Shams isnt proffesional, he is just a dumb kid.

Also to be clear you are probably alt of one of ota staff or you are just a dumb guy that doesnt understand anthying lol
RumGuru - Here is their discord link if anyone wants to join.

ShamsPlays - awhile back, rum was actually in a group ThunderX made for my other hosting company (VolcanicNodes). He actually said the n word and kept saying it in the group. Sadly after we abandoned the company, We deleted the company aswell.

RumGuru - ShamsPlays show full screenshots dude lmao
RumGuru - ShamsPlays so im gonna say for those sreenshots what i remeber.

ScreenShot alphy send something that crashes discord.
Screenshot you were talking that my host is bad and much other bad stuff
Screenshot your and thunders host was opening for like 2 months and thats why i said that.
Screenshot alphy was saying my chatbot was bad, then i asked bot is alphy stupid as a joke 

So @ShamsPlays all those screenshots are out of context lmao
RumGuru - ShamsPlays and what is this supposed to mean lmao?
ShamsPlays - RumGuru "bad" I never said anything related to it. I only said who runs a host at 4 vcores. It wasn't even related to your server
RumGuru - ShamsPlays nah you were saying bad stuff about my host
RumGuru - Also everyone just to alert you.

Shams is a little scared kid.

When he needs to tell me something he unblocks me, and right after, he blocks me so i cant respond to him lmao.
RumGuru - they hosting fivem now lmao
