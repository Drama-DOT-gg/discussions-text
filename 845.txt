I guess another mod banned him for spamming and he cried to me. Logged his IP and he lives in Kolkata. It gets even better. I guess his friend or his alt messaged me. I checked and the accounts are friends.

Logged his IP and he is from Sweden. Please spam these annoying kids who waste my time (blocked out my name as to not leak who I am...)
Kowone - sigh why do people love to log others' ip
Harrib - Why not? At least I now know they are not alts.
Rufus - ok
Deleted User - Harrib Added both, waiting for them to add me back.
