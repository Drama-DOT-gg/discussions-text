Ryan - Jen

Ryan - BabyAces ur just mad because we didn't want to buy a node from u .
KatSystem - Let us reiterate, YOU GUYS ARE RATING A HOST THAT HASN'T EVEN GOT ON ITS FEET YET.
Jedrik - KatSystem ok and
Ryan - Jedrik i think what katsystem trying to say is that drama.gg likes destroying host

i mean sure the ones that scam and stuff but ones like this with minor issues but good nodes like cmon 

if u dont wanna use our services its fine but don't make everyone hates us
BabyAces - I am mad at the unperfestional your staff disrespect to your "clients".
ItsYaBoyBanana - what's the website?
KatSystem - Ryan exactly
Ryan - BabyAces litterally there was no disrespect unless if bad grammar is considered disrespectful these days . check our public chat and our general there's 0 disrespect we love our clients and we always treat them well , as i said "our client "

not people who tries to destroy us
Ryan - ItsYaBoyBanana https://client.catservices.cloud/
BabyAces - ItsYaBoyBanana scroll all the way to the top of the thread
ItsYaBoyBanana - so you're telling me that the privacy policy and terms of services are in a Discord channel?
KatSystem - BabyAces Unprofessionalism can be respectfully addressed, not fucking ousted. And we disrespect you, who are directly disrespecting our effort in creating a brand new host. Not clients. You aren't even a fucking client.
Ryan - ItsYaBoyBanana they were on the site but now we're editing some stuff on it and we're experiencing issues that was temporary
KatSystem - KatSystem Oh, and btw, we (KatSystem) will be talking with Ryan and Cat about staff professionalism. We have been a part of over a dozen hosts previously, and know how/when to be professional.
BabyAces - You guys realize that your making your self look bad about this. I have owned more host's than you and I have been staff on more host's than you. You guys are not respectful to your clients or anything. You guys shouldn't try to make yourself look good cause you can't. You both have just been making your rep go down. So I recommend being kind and respectful.
KatSystem - BabyAces Right. How many years have you been in the hosting business?
BabyAces - Over a year in half.
KatSystem - Try two, going on three years.
BabyAces - If you been in this for over 3 years you would know what to have and fucking fix. Use your dan brain.
KatSystem - BabyAces Get a life
BabyAces - I got one unlike you.
Ryan - BabyAces you keep saying we were mean and disrespectful send photos that prove that 

if you dont have anything to send shutup
BabyAces - I already showed that so ya.
Ryan - BabyAces thats not disrespectful thats grammar mistakes
BabyAces - What kat said to me was disrespectful.
Sloth - mtt 
Termly is alright for a permanent TOS or Privacy Policy. It's valid, and nobody gives a fuck to have $300 legal docs if nobody's gonna read em'.
Vanquish - so, just to get this straight. you made a full thread to show that they can't spell?

BabyAces
PugRug - this is rlly sad lollll i was working at cat services then they gave me admin for a bit i was working hard and moderating etc and then they demoted me for being inactive i thought this would get hoaxed anyway.

TME - BabyAces Let me know, if you find any mistakes in any of the announcements I have made. First of all, you come up to use asking for Owner rank and when we refuse you hoax us ..........
RusJS - TME babyaces your an actual idiot bruh.. they done nothing you just demand for owner on every single host same with me lke u wanted some free dashactyl themes and i said no and u blocked me and banned me from all of ur hosts lel (dis guy is rocket/rectrox/endermined/smiley btw)
