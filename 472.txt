Rectrox - PugRug  You guys should follow Drama.gg rules fyi.
Verse - Rectrox we are lmfao.
EdwardSnowde - Rectrox should we mention the past homophobia, and past racism. As well as your unbelievable time offline. Man is a gold digger. Asked for a node, provided a node, and then "THIS ISNT GOOD ENOUGH" then goes to some random vps panel and shuts it down
Verse - EdwardSnowde sounds like something Rectrox would do, tsk tsk tsk.

Jedrik - That's enough move to the Rectrox thread if you're gonna shit on him
Rectrox - @Jedrik  Can you add Maple/Verse in the name?
Jedrik - Defend your self or add to the thread, it's getting off-topic
EdwardSnowde - Jedrik this is funny, he makes a thread about verse, and gets shit on his head. like legit water boarding toilet.
Jedrik - I agree, it's funny, but either defend Verse or add to his "expos√©". The threads is on Verse

If you want to shit on him feel free to do so on his already existing thread.

Thanks!
eraters - Daftscientist agreed
EdwardSnowde - Jedrik there has been legit nothing about verse. This man @Rectrox dosn't even know how to use OBS.

Zugirf - J0SH We did discuss this.
No administrative roles would be given to the COO and no access to our hosts via our platform.
Everything would be safe as possible, but I'm glad the "merge" didn't go through.
