mtt - Now, let me get started.
I was in BlueFox Hosting server and i have the "Other Host owner" role which allows me to promote my host in there.
I created an ad and promoted my host there as usual.
After some days, this dude (_Player1) casually steals my ad which was literally above.

My ad


His "ad"


Here is the first confrontation where he tried denying it while admitting to it...


My other owner tried confronting him about it and he just got banned lmao.





I got the owner to remove his role as the host is also sketchy.


Now lets look at this host.


Using contabo.
Now hear me out, it's not them using contabo that matters.
Their prices are ridiculous and also have the lowest vps plan on the contabo vps line.


Prices:



Owner also has no clue what they're doing.


While banning my other owner, he removed the Pterodactyl bot LMFAO.

Also lets see that they have their panel as glizhost.firewalk.host.
A host in a host? welp...

Vanquish - sick thread, but for that last part "A host in a host? welp..." _Player1 is using a temporary sub domain and has purchased his own domain and is preparing to transfer things shortly.
mtt - Vanquish makes sense. i remove that but the other stuff still stands lmfao
Vanquish - also, an explanation for me having the co-founder role

I volunteered to help _Player1 out with his new host, he's new to the game give him a break.
but I do agree that he shouldn't of taken the advertisement.


What did Flaring remove on that screenshot by the way?
mtt - Vanquish He removed his "Other Host Owner" role. I was not clear
EmeraldMike - Those are the most outrageous plans I have ever seen. Like who would by them.
Shiv - EmeraldMike he said they're only that bad so he gets money to buy a better node... He ain't getting a single sale with that trash tho
Shiv - Vanquish sure, but he was also asked to remove it, which he didn't.
EmeraldMike - Shiv makes sense but still. You can get better specs for free

EmeraldMike - 0 just means unlimited
Vanquish - understandable have a nice day 

was that funny at all? no? okay

anyway, I recommended that he reduced the pricing juristically and he did it.

EmeraldMike by the way, what's that first image?
EmeraldMike - Vanquish  From my host. Won't say the name because mods will think I am AdVeRtIsInG
Vanquish - doubt it, dm me on discord though. Vanquish#5889
EmeraldMike - FlaringPhoenix ik (;
Vanquish - no fuck this host ignore my old replies
EmeraldMike - Vanquish 😂
mtt - Manz selling his host with 100 members and 1 node for $50 lmfao
