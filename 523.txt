dslpDev - Hello everyone. You probably clicked this because you thought it would be some sort of funny joke and maybe you are right. Let's look into server.pro's website.

nice grammar.

professional terminology.

Okay, let's just say VPS is a new feature and nobody has noticed these mistakes yet. Let's move on.

Editing Files, the Right Way. I have my entire life edited files the wrong way, thank god server.pro is here to save me. With all fairness, however, their file manager and text editor are terrible. They lack any keyboard controls, e.g. ctrl+s to save the file esc to close it. Navigating files is a nightmare. You can't see the full path you are browsing but only the name of the parent directory. To get back to an upper directory you need click multiple times the parent folder.
I am a little concerned about this comma but I'll just pretend I don't see it. 

Ah ye thanks for giving me a subdomain for free, it usually costs a lot of money. Thank you. But at least don't lie to me about owning it. If your server expires, anyone can take your subdomain.

I am a bit confused here. Are we getting sexual or we are just pretending to be 5 years old?

I keep on being confised here. What is this supposed to mean? "We have enough features to keep you using our services for a few days"?
Let's dive in.

Ignore the grammar, you've seen nothing! What a scam, they don't actually create a website for you but just a page with ads on their website.

Thank god this hosting provider has a powerful console, the most powerful on the market! I am so done with hosting providers with weak consoles.

Actually this is very nice. But wait a moment, didn't bukkit implement this into Minecraft? Oh yeah, I forgot, server.pro limit your .jar files in /plugins to 10 so I guess they have a finger here too.

I always found it very inconvenient to change level-name=world in server.properties. Thank server.pro for implementing this important feature so that you no longer have to change a single word in the config.

Excuse the question but isn't this called upscaling? "Select an upgrade and wait for a reboot. Easy as that." Yeah, pay us for a better plan then just wait for your server to randomly reboot and you should be fine.

Please translate this to me. I don't get what they are saying.

Yeah we talked about this already.

I think we can be pretty confident they just ran out of space.

No, I am not. I am not a hosting provider.


So far so good.

Let me scroll down so you can read the rest. Oh my bad, that's all of it. Let's enjoy this Privacy policy with 2 lines of text and 3 sentences.

Let's not talk about the general grammar on this page. It is clear server.pro learned english from a falix staff member. At least I can't spot many differences in the language both websites use.

I know you are all impressed by server.pro. You probably already want to work for them. You might be in luck!

I have always wanted to work as a "role" especially as a "customer support role". And I also always wanted to work for a VPS server. I could never imagine a better boss.
Some of the requirements. I will not even comment.

And the most important, the bonus:

If you are willing to go the extra mile, you are perfect for this job. I am not sure what this is trying to hint, but the entire job posting gives me vibes that you will be involved in some illegal activities. "Diffuse tense situtations", "take responsibility in front of customers", "18+", "use Slack (an any other software that we require you to install)". I don't know, you tell me.

By the way this post is longer than the server.pro terms of use and privacy policy combined.

They lack any keyboard controls, e.g. ctrl+s to save the file esc to close it. Navigating files is a nightmare. You can't see the full path you are browsing but only the name of the parent directory. To get back to an upper directory you need click multiple times the parent folder.
I am a little concerned about this comma but I'll just pretend I don't see it. 

Ah ye thanks for giving me a subdomain for free, it usually costs a lot of money. Thank you. But at least don't lie to me about owning it. If your server expires, anyone can take your subdomain.

I am a bit confused here. Are we getting sexual or we are just pretending to be 5 years old?

I keep on being confised here. What is this supposed to mean? "We have enough features to keep you using our services for a few days"?
Let's dive in.

Ignore the grammar, you've seen nothing! What a scam, they don't actually create a website for you but just a page with ads on their website.

Thank god this hosting provider has a powerful console, the most powerful on the market! I am so done with hosting providers with weak consoles.

Actually this is very nice. But wait a moment, didn't bukkit implement this into Minecraft? Oh yeah, I forgot, server.pro limit your .jar files in /plugins to 10 so I guess they have a finger here too.

I always found it very inconvenient to change level-name=world in server.properties. Thank server.pro for implementing this important feature so that you no longer have to change a single word in the config.

Excuse the question but isn't this called upscaling? "Select an upgrade and wait for a reboot. Easy as that." Yeah, pay us for a better plan then just wait for your server to randomly reboot and you should be fine.

Please translate this to me. I don't get what they are saying.

Yeah we talked about this already.

I think we can be pretty confident they just ran out of space.

No, I am not. I am not a hosting provider.


So far so good.

Let me scroll down so you can read the rest. Oh my bad, that's all of it. Let's enjoy this Privacy policy with 2 lines of text and 3 sentences.

Let's not talk about the general grammar on this page. It is clear server.pro learned english from a falix staff member. At least I can't spot many differences in the language both websites use.

I know you are all impressed by server.pro. You probably already want to work for them. You might be in luck!

I have always wanted to work as a "role" especially as a "customer support role". And I also always wanted to work for a VPS server. I could never imagine a better boss.
Some of the requirements. I will not even comment.

And the most important, the bonus:

If you are willing to go the extra mile, you are perfect for this job. I am not sure what this is trying to hint, but the entire job posting gives me vibes that you will be involved in some illegal activities. "Diffuse tense situtations", "take responsibility in front of customers", "18+", "use Slack (an any other software that we require you to install)". I don't know, you tell me.

By the way this post is longer than the server.pro terms of use and privacy policy combined.

I am a little concerned about this comma but I'll just pretend I don't see it. 

Ah ye thanks for giving me a subdomain for free, it usually costs a lot of money. Thank you. But at least don't lie to me about owning it. If your server expires, anyone can take your subdomain.

I am a bit confused here. Are we getting sexual or we are just pretending to be 5 years old?

I keep on being confised here. What is this supposed to mean? "We have enough features to keep you using our services for a few days"?
Let's dive in.

Ignore the grammar, you've seen nothing! What a scam, they don't actually create a website for you but just a page with ads on their website.

Thank god this hosting provider has a powerful console, the most powerful on the market! I am so done with hosting providers with weak consoles.

Actually this is very nice. But wait a moment, didn't bukkit implement this into Minecraft? Oh yeah, I forgot, server.pro limit your .jar files in /plugins to 10 so I guess they have a finger here too.

I always found it very inconvenient to change level-name=world in server.properties. Thank server.pro for implementing this important feature so that you no longer have to change a single word in the config.

Excuse the question but isn't this called upscaling? "Select an upgrade and wait for a reboot. Easy as that." Yeah, pay us for a better plan then just wait for your server to randomly reboot and you should be fine.

Please translate this to me. I don't get what they are saying.

Yeah we talked about this already.

I think we can be pretty confident they just ran out of space.

No, I am not. I am not a hosting provider.


So far so good.

Let me scroll down so you can read the rest. Oh my bad, that's all of it. Let's enjoy this Privacy policy with 2 lines of text and 3 sentences.

Let's not talk about the general grammar on this page. It is clear server.pro learned english from a falix staff member. At least I can't spot many differences in the language both websites use.

I know you are all impressed by server.pro. You probably already want to work for them. You might be in luck!

I have always wanted to work as a "role" especially as a "customer support role". And I also always wanted to work for a VPS server. I could never imagine a better boss.
Some of the requirements. I will not even comment.

And the most important, the bonus:

If you are willing to go the extra mile, you are perfect for this job. I am not sure what this is trying to hint, but the entire job posting gives me vibes that you will be involved in some illegal activities. "Diffuse tense situtations", "take responsibility in front of customers", "18+", "use Slack (an any other software that we require you to install)". I don't know, you tell me.

By the way this post is longer than the server.pro terms of use and privacy policy combined.

nice grammar.

Okay, let's just say VPS is a new feature and nobody has noticed these mistakes yet. Let's move on.

Editing Files, the Right Way. I have my entire life edited files the wrong way, thank god server.pro is here to save me. With all fairness, however, their file manager and text editor are terrible.

I keep on being confised here. What is this supposed to mean? "We have enough features to keep you using our services for a few days"?
Let's dive in.

Ignore the grammar, you've seen nothing! What a scam, they don't actually create a website for you but just a page with ads on their website.

Thank god this hosting provider has a powerful console, the most powerful on the market! I am so done with hosting providers with weak consoles.

Actually this is very nice. But wait a moment, didn't bukkit implement this into Minecraft? Oh yeah, I forgot, server.pro limit your .jar files in /plugins to 10 so I guess they have a finger here too.

I always found it very inconvenient to change level-name=world in server.properties. Thank server.pro for implementing this important feature so that you no longer have to change a single word in the config.

Excuse the question but isn't this called upscaling? "Select an upgrade and wait for a reboot. Easy as that." Yeah, pay us for a better plan then just wait for your server to randomly reboot and you should be fine.

Please translate this to me. I don't get what they are saying.

Yeah we talked about this already.

I think we can be pretty confident they just ran out of space.

No, I am not. I am not a hosting provider.


So far so good.

Let me scroll down so you can read the rest. Oh my bad, that's all of it. Let's enjoy this Privacy policy with 2 lines of text and 3 sentences.

Let's not talk about the general grammar on this page. It is clear server.pro learned english from a falix staff member. At least I can't spot many differences in the language both websites use.

I know you are all impressed by server.pro. You probably already want to work for them. You might be in luck!

I have always wanted to work as a "role" especially as a "customer support role". And I also always wanted to work for a VPS server. I could never imagine a better boss.
Some of the requirements. I will not even comment.

And the most important, the bonus:

If you are willing to go the extra mile, you are perfect for this job. I am not sure what this is trying to hint, but the entire job posting gives me vibes that you will be involved in some illegal activities. "Diffuse tense situtations", "take responsibility in front of customers", "18+", "use Slack (an any other software that we require you to install)". I don't know, you tell me.

By the way this post is longer than the server.pro terms of use and privacy policy combined.

EDIT: I forgot the actual scam I was going to post about. Expectation:

Reality


The choice isn't limited because of the free plan. I have selected to pay $40 for 12GB - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-20/1621529517-921082-image.png
dslpDev - Hello everyone. You probably clicked this because you thought it would be some sort of funny joke and maybe you are right. Let's look into server.pro's website.

nice grammar.

professional terminology.

Okay, let's just say VPS is a new feature and nobody has noticed these mistakes yet. Let's move on.

Editing Files, the Right Way. I have my entire life edited files the wrong way, thank god server.pro is here to save me. With all fairness, however, their file manager and text editor are terrible. They lack any keyboard controls, e.g. ctrl+s to save the file esc to close it. Navigating files is a nightmare. You can't see the full path you are browsing but only the name of the parent directory. To get back to an upper directory you need click multiple times the parent folder.
I am a little concerned about this comma but I'll just pretend I don't see it.

Ray - wtf $40 for 12gb
RusJS - dslpDev dude they are like the best host out there... also their prices are actually worth it so dont even try blaming on them if you dont even have a server. because that page can be accessed only if you dont have a server... also you need to learn grammar too lmao... those screenshots make perfect sense. if your saying "so far so good" then what are you on about lmao also what they mean by "read to starting hosting" is that the users would start hosting their MINECRAFT. SERVER. FOR. FRIENDS. TO. PLAY. also what grammar is wrong on those VPS selling on their page
Sydney - Final verdict: EVERYONE NEEDS TO GET BETTER IN THE GRAMMAR DEPARTMENT.
Iceey - Their PRIV is GDPR breaching
J0SH - 🤦‍♂️
Pamar - off topic but wha- nice about page - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-20/1621538500-601695-image.png
dslpDev - RusJS What page can be accessed without having a server? I have had a premium server with them. "So far, so good" is an idiom. Excuse me for missing the comma there. And no, they are not correct. "All vps serevrs comes", "that let's you share": this is some nice grammar straight out of falix though.

Here is some knowledge for you:
to host (verb) means that you are providing the service. E.g. "We will host your website". "Start hosting your server" means start hosting it on your own.

And if anyone wants more server.pro scams:


Not a major difference I would say. Oh and the 6vCores plan on a 4-core i7-7700K is also very interesting.

Their cheaper VPS line has a better CPU so you are definitely doing some gambling here haha


Anyone else still claiming this is a good host? And yeah 12 GB for $40 is such a bargain! - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-20/1621543195-279631-image.png

dslpDev - Sydney Especially hosting companies with a website in production that is seen by thousands of people. I am not from the USA and I don't pretend to be perfectly fluent, but then, I am not a a popular company with a website in production.
Jamie_ - I used to use them when I was a lot younger for a Minecraft server I always dreamt of running, their prices and website were a lot better back then but then I think they got bought out and their website and everything changed. Their also a Swedish company.
Jamie_ - They were fine for me and had great support.
leastile - eh
