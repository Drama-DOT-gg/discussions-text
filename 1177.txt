wtf
 if you do break the rules or just harass the staff team at all you will give the owner aka. â˜¯ Qlox â˜¯#1000 full right to sue you.
i will have full right to take over your discord server and your any servers on my host!
no vpns
we do not allow freenom domains so if you wanna make a custom domain it has to be paid
we do not take ANY responsibilty for data loss if your using this host you agree that it can happen and there is nothing you can do about it such as taking legal action!
any data uploaded on our services will be owned by us meaning if u do get your server suspended we have the right to not give your data back!
if you get banned you give us full right to sell your data!
just put the funniest in bold
CharityLexus - Deveroonie any data uploaded on our services will be owned by us meaning if u do get your server suspended we have the right to not give your data back!
if you get banned you give us full right to sell your data!
