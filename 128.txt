mxnugget - Who is Kyoto? Kyoto is a Romanian hoster. He owns ValmHost, which is a rebrand of his previous hosting "company", Point-Host.

Let's say I'm a client and I want to see their "high quality services"!

I bet this page was made in 10 minutes. Really, I mean the CPanel logo is scaled &amp; the LightSpeed logo has png transparent squares behind.

Oh, and he's really a FlatIcon (owner of BillingFox &amp; thos-host) wannabe. He copied his TOS word by word.
https://thos-host.com/terms-and-conditions
https://valmhost.com/terms

And this is not enough. This man is that big of a wannabe that he created his billing system called BytBilling, like FlatIcon did. If it was good/better, I would not mention this. But its crappy af. I tried making an account &amp; logging in it, but guess what - email invalid! (test it at redmarket.xyz)

Also, I got this error too:


At least if you want to be wannabe of FlatIcon, do it good/better. What you did is a website for your host in 15 minutes, without even organizing the type of hosting &amp; a cheap copy of BillingFox. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-10-27/1603775557-341869-image.png

FlatIcon - Yeah, looks like this guy try to copy me.
I will check if BytBilling is against my intellectual property and issue a DMCA compliance if it is.
Sincerely i'm a little bit proud someone try to do something like i did, but in the same time i feel like it is not okay because working on BillingFox was extremely hard, months and months of work and learning, simply to someone try to copy my ideas.
mxnugget - FlatIcon At least if BytBilling would be better, or good. But it's crappy. Really crappy.

Also, Kyoto got the domain valmhost.biz suspended 1 mo ago because he completed random info. Very professional host indeed. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-10-27/1603791022-306527-image.png
mxnugget - Oh dear Kyoto, you're now deleting the TOS because you can get a legal punishment by copying Thos-Host's TOS?
https://gyazo.com/d95b6c206f14ab8c9288d728effbe018
don't worry, I have saved the HTML file of your previous TOS. https://ufile.io/l27bkjks
Don't think you're getting away.
mxnugget - (deleted the previous message because some wrong translatation - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-10-27/1603797785-745415-image.png
FlatIcon - mxnugget valmhost.biz* was suspended.
He completed domain info with totally random information like... "Vlad Tacto" (Tacto is a gramatical issue, but it can be understood as "Your dad"), you know every registrar's account (+domains) can be disabled if the contact information is set wrong, if there's an extreme case  it can even conduct into legal binding.
mxnugget - haha Kyoto changed his whole theme &amp; TOS xD
loser
Withdrawal - CrackerXD You will fuck his mom with what?
mxnugget - lmao @CrackerXD .
Jedrik - @CrackerXD Relax. 1 day suspension, please contact me on discord for appeals or complaints Jedrik#4495
mxnugget - no SSL on their website, I love ValmHost - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-11-05/1604556573-835218-image.png
eraters - hold on that looks like my own free host
eraters - also to register they need your address? - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-11-05/1604582188-343611-image.png
mtt - I registered under fake details and got into the panel. That's just the BillingFox panel with a new color and name...
eraters - they use billingfox which is open source meaning its easier for hackers to look through files for a way in. 
Hmm. How odd. 

Where's http://cpanel.valmhost.com/ then?
Also, if you go to http://valmhost.com:2082/ which is included with every cpanel hosted site, it in fact does not load - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-11-05/1604582460-707473-image.png

mtt - They say they have BillingFox but when entering their panel it says 'Thanks for using BytBilling' huh?
mxnugget - when will this be confirmed
also, here is a link to ValmHost's official Discord server: https://discord.gg/4cydV7YuYS
mxnugget - can this post get some attention
Kyoto - Hello, Nugget!

As I see, your problems are persisting.

First of all, I reply you because you said that you want attention: https://imgur.com/HJdUQ1y.png

Ok, i will give you attention, no problem.

I don't copy BillingFox.

As you can see, BillingFox Login is this: https://imgur.com/7H20c8Q and BytBilling Login is this: https://imgur.com/zJJVurV

I consultated with some friends, and they said that BytBilling is total different than BillingFox.

Related on Copying BillingFox. Hmm, I think BillingFox is copying WHMCS: 
Langs WHMCS: https://imgur.com/sWDEJt5
Langs BillingFox: https://imgur.com/PTHogJ7

As you can see, they are absolutely the same, but text are different. Oh, that's a problem for BillingFox.

Also, if you are so curios, BytBilling is not copying anyone: https://imgur.com/k8BaiXK

Related on Themes &amp; Client Area themes.

BytBilling Default Theme it is not the same as BillingFox Default Theme or a copy of it, the CSS And HTML Code is total different, you can see yourself.

Related on valmhost.biz, i bought it fast, because my principal domain were not working and i needed, now everything is solved.

I am proud that you are following me everyday and you are UP with all my Updates.

Have a nice day / afternoon / night!
mxnugget - Kyoto lol, as i said to you, I don't bring up anymore the argument that "you copy FlatIcon"
You're now trying to be innocent, after you denied what I said in our DMs, then said I'm right and then after yet again you started to deny what I was saying
Also, how about the copied TOS that you deleted because you were so right. 

Oh, as I see you copied it again from Thos-Host.

what a coward
Kyoto - Oh, also I forgot to say that Nugget joined on my Discord Server and started talking about BytBilling making false statements and making spam with this topic link.

https://imgur.com/oPQiote

Why are you spamming me? Hmm.

https://imgur.com/ToHIJMO

Oh, his friends was spamming also: https://imgur.com/gIX4vwf

Nuggets, why are you stealing my clients? https://imgur.com/uNR7tsA

Why are you sending to all your friends messages like: Kyoto is stupid? https://imgur.com/YLvYIFc

Hmm, that is not ok, i thinked that you were a good fan of ValmHost, i don't think this comportament will help you with remidore.
mxnugget - and how about your website that wasn't secure for some time? ( no SSL on login page)
Kyoto - mxnugget Can you provide me a proof that i copyed Thos-Host?
mxnugget - Kyoto stealing your clients? I know that guy for like 6 months
Kyoto - mxnugget There is a SSL on login page. https://imgur.com/k2HarWI
mxnugget - Kyoto for some time it wasn't. I have proof, look at my posts above
Kyoto - mxnugget Yes, you are stealing my clients. I provide you all the proofs you need, now I want you to provide me proofs that I copied BillingFox.
mxnugget - Kyoto you copied Thos-Host's TOS, not Thos-Host, read correctly
Kyoto - mxnugget In your above proof, I don't see anything to be same as Billingfox and also i consultated with some friends before said that.
mxnugget - Kyoto bruh, as I said, you're a wannabe of FlatIcon, but I didn't say you copied BillingFox's template or design.
Kyoto - I want proof for coping BillingFox, you didn't provide me a clearly proof that BytBilling is a copy of BillingFox. I gave you a screenshot that, Langs Code from BillingFox is the same as WHMCS Langs Code, but text different
Kyoto - mxnugget I am not wannabe of FlatIcon. I provide you all the proofs you want.
Kyoto - FlatIcon is my friend and that is.
Kyoto - But, what about your comportament on my Discord server and my friends?
mxnugget - Kyoto do you know how to read and do you know how to speak with the right person about some things that I did not tell you? What langs 
 theme thing do you dream
Kyoto - mxnugget Bro, you said that i am coping BillingFox. Correct? I show you a proof that BillingFox is coping WHMCS, it is the same code but text different.
mxnugget - Kyoto I said that you're copying the concept, like the type of software, not the design or code, and i did f*ing tell you that let's forget about the "you copied flaticon" argument, can't you go over that
mxnugget - Kyoto show the proof that BF is copying WHMCS
mxnugget - i know that BF was copying some popular WHMCS theme
Kyoto - mxnugget I showed you the proof up,

Langs WHMCS: https://imgur.com/sWDEJt5
Langs BillingFox: https://imgur.com/PTHogJ7

No, i don't want to forget about copied Flaticon, you said that i am FlatIcon wannabe.
mxnugget - and yes, my comportment on your server was childish - but look what a coward you are, it's not like i would do that without a valid reason
Kyoto - It is not a Theme, it is BillingFox Language Code, not a theme.
mxnugget - Kyoto if you weren't such a [redacted] i would not tell you wannabe ok
you got a small point here tho
mxnugget - Kyoto ok you confused me now
Kyoto - If i was a coward, I wouldn't answer your topic. I don't think that your comportament was coward, you wanted to defame ValmHost and BytBilling with a lot of spam and 50+ tags.
Kyoto - But, what about your Free WebHosting for remidore.com? Hmm. Why are you using Free WebHosting, i thought that remidore is a good project, but with your comportament and free hosting you will never have success.
mxnugget - Kyoto you excuse yourself being coward 1 week ago by now responding to my post

genius
Kyoto - Hmm, I think that you don't know the meaning of coward.
Kyoto - And i don't excuse myself with nothing
mxnugget - Kyoto there's a difference between remidore.com and remidorecloud.com
remidore.com is kind of like a gateway to all my projects, so i don't really care about what webhost i use
remidorecloud.com is my future hosting company.

also, pointhost had a free domain before it was renamed to valmhost
Kyoto - How do you explain that? https://imgur.com/cKxHEm2
Kyoto - mxnugget Sure. I know that Point-host had a free domain. Every Hosting Company has a startup.
mxnugget - Kyoto how many times do i have to explain you that i know this guy from like March or April 2020 and I had some drama with him before all this valmshit madness
mxnugget - Kyoto cough COUGH

Kyoto - mxnugget ValmShit? Hmm, why are you offending ValmHost?
Kyoto - mxnugget Yea, i didn't know that you are at start with remidore, i am sorry about that.
mxnugget - Kyoto because you can't even make your own tos or at least use a generator, no, you need to copy someone's else tos (which is illegal btw)
Kyoto - mxnugget I already have my own TOS. The old TOS,  I know that is my mistake, I copied it from my old theme, i didn't checked it, but every company  have small / big problems. I don't think that reproval will cover up what you did.
Kyoto - I will stop there, we are making too much spam here. Contact pe on discord if you want to talk.
mxnugget - lol excuse after excuse xD
mxnugget - ok gn
Kyoto - mxnugget Lol, I think you have problems. Where I excuse myself?
mtt - Kyoto

"I already have my own TOS. The old TOS, I know that is my mistake, I copied it from my old theme, i didn't checked it, but every company have small / big problems. I don't think that reproval will cover up what you did."
Kyoto - mxnugget Sure. I don't think that recognize the truth it is a problem or a shame.
Kyoto - You said something with ValmShit. Why are you offending my company? I didn't offended Remidore.
Kyoto - I will stop here. We posted too much comments and we are making spam there. Good Night! If your problems are persisting, you can find me on Discord. Kyoto#2020
mxnugget - I see that your website doesn't have an SSL yet again.

Kyoto - mxnugget Yes, i am sure. I think you are using al old browser, idk.
Kyoto - Try here: https://valmhost.com/
mxnugget - Kyoto oh, when i type "valmhost.com" it redirects me to the http version. You should solve this issue, otherwise data will be sniffed for clients that not include the "https://" and only type "valmhost.com".
mxnugget - tried on Chrome (I use Edge Dev) too - if you don't include the "https://" in the search bar, you'll enter the http version of your website.
Jedrik - mxnugget Redirects to https for me
mxnugget - Jedrik weird
mxnugget - https://gyazo.com/2860b8d19e57809ddbef1c49bff05adc
this happens to me
weird, it probably is a problem from my browser
Kyoto - mxnugget probably you have cache salved or something like that. For me and others, it works.
Kyoto - Nugget, when do you want to rezolve your problems and stop hating ValmHost? We are making too much spam there and that's not ok.
K1nder2019 - I don't know why it won't work - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-11-06/1604663011-428642-image.png
K1nder2019 - BillingFox and BytBilling are not exactly alike, I agree that some of my money, services, domains and bills are put exactly where BillingFox is put but let's not forget that this is the only similarity, I'm not saying BytBilling is better than BillingFox , I'm just saying that it doesn't look exactly like BytBilling, the design is a little better than BillingFox and BytBilling is translated into several languages.
K1nder2019 - This is the only similarity but if you keep saying that there are many things that look like BillingFox we will launch in v7 a new version much better than the current one with a unique look and that will not look at all like whmcs / BillingFox - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-11-06/1604663447-720404-image.png
Kyoto - K1nder2019 Hmm, i see  that WHMCS and other softwares are exactly puted in the same place.
K1nder2019 - I also like BillingFox and BytBilling but considering the fact that I have a BytBilling license and I had a BillingFox license I can easily figure out the similarities but if you mind you can contact me on discord K1nder2019 # 6331 and you can tell me what it looks like with BillingFox and we will change
K1nder2019 - From my point of view BytBilling and BillingFox are almost equal but each has something that the other does not have, for example BillingFox has a very good security but the design is not really super wow but it is quite nice, BytBilling has a very nice design but a security almost as good as BillingFox
FlatIcon - To finish that thread, BytBilling is NOT a modified BillingFox version, BytBilling is a remake-attempt of BillingFox.

I will try to be neutral and i have to say "BytBilling have a lack of base features of a hosting company, it is not usable and it should not be used until is finished.".

I'm too tired about this war, Kyoto have to finish his billing software and don't name it "software" until it is not fully finished, how is it also on 1.4 version (or whatever) without having a stable release?
Iceey - Don't use third-party billing software like this go for whmcs
Tomas - Iceey Isn't WHMCS a third party billing service too?
Iceey - Tomas Yes that's true, I've chosen the wrong word to bold, but WHMCS is above all standards and actually certified to do what it does. I personally wouldn't use something like hBill if it was third-party.
Kyoto - FlatIcon I disagree you, BytBilling is not a remake of BillingFox. Also, if you want to  stands up this ideea, i can say that BillingFox is a remake of another software, i don't want to give name.
INfoUpgraders - lol
Jedrik - Kyoto i can say that BillingFox is a remake of another software, i don't want to give name

I swear to fucking god this is one of the shittiest excuses ever, it's like the whole Battle Royale argument, just because it copied something doesn't justify copying the exact same shit and adding small details to it calling it an "original" or "not a remake" "not a copy"
mxnugget - Jedrik That's what I tried to tell him too.
mxnugget - Oh shit, Kyoto is back again. Selling nulled licenses.

I don't think you realize @Kyoto , but these nulled licenses may do bad things like:
They can carry viruses, because they're not from an official source, they're from some edgy software crackers from nulled.to, cracked.to or other shitty "hacker" forum/website.
Show unprofessionalism for your business. Nobody likes nulled licenses, do they?
Can ruin buyer's reputation.

As you see, there are no lifetime/one-time licenses available, and even if they were unless you were a big-ass company throwing money on the roof, you couldn't afford to sell an offer like this.

And you except me to "forget about all these things and be friends" in DMs.
no.

Kyoto - Ok, so i am too tired about this sh*t subject and your character.

I understand that you have nothing else to do, but you are too annoying.

I will skip to describe you, so

I am NOT using WHMCS Nulled, but i see that you don't know how to check it, I will help you

You go there: https://www.whmcs.com/members/verifydomain.php and type the domain you want to check

Stop lying people, dude, you are so annoying.
mxnugget - Kyoto not using, selling
can't you read properly

🤡🤡🤡

you're trying to make excuses at each accusation...
Kyoto - mxnugget 

DUDE, go on the FU**KING  link I sent you and check each of my domains to see that i am not using nulled. 
Are you hit in the head?
mxnugget - Kyoto No, you're.
I'M SAYING AGAIN, DO YOU KNOW HOW TO READ ENGLISH?

I said that you're selling nulled licenses, not using.
Look:

You're such a liar and clown who tries to make excuses at each valid proof that I send... - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-11-19/1605811502-448367-image.png
Kyoto - mxnugget Where i am selling nulled licensing man? are you blind? Check on the link i gave you: web-services.host
Kyoto - mxnugget Also, you are a clown, because you are fu**king my head every day with your lying accusation and all your frustrations about ValmHost, because you can't have success with remish*t.
mxnugget - Kyoto The fact that you mention "lifetime" WHMCS automatically means it's nulled. There's no lifetime WHMCS.

And also, there are ways to authorize nulled software very easily, most probably by abusing the trial or some other bug that lets you have authorized WHMCS.
Kyoto - mxnugget https://imgur.com/vIDgvCu.png
Kyoto - mxnugget No, it is not nulled. Stop lying people.
Robert - Those are not legit WHMCS licenses, they are in fact just fake and verified by a method or backdoor. (Otherwise, you wouldn't be able to sell them for such a low price.) This is what mxnugget refers to as "nulled licenses".
mxnugget - Kyoto hmm, ig I won't consume my time anymore trying to deal with brainless people like you. Goodbye and expect the worse.

By 'the worse' I don't mean DDOS attacks, Discord raids, or anything else like this, I mean karma.
mxnugget - Robert Thank you, that's what I'm trying to say too.

(for example, Andrei verified the domain remidoreisshit.com, even tho the domain is not even valid nor someone bought a license for it. He used some weird tool from the internet.)
Tomas - Well, you see- the licences aren't necessarily "nulled", I'd describe them as "glitched" as they are obtained via a glitch in the WHMCS licencing system.
mxnugget - Tomas still, lifetime licenses don't exist.
Kyoto - mxnugget bruh, you are brainless 🤣🤣, you commented on this topic: “Kyoto is selling nulled whmcs license”, without any proof, you are trying to get attention and more of things. You didn't checked on their website to see if is nulled or not. Also, i am not using a tool or something, i get the licenses from their original website, lol. 

About karma, to karma me, before that you need to have arguments and proofs. I will stop there, you are disgusting me.
Kyoto - Go to play Minecraft, good luck!
Korudo - Kyoto, most licenses which are "Lifetime" are abusing HostGator.
Tomas - mxnugget it's glitched, so yes in a sense
