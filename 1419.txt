gavinx2031 - I have already emailed them on this issue i just want to archive there mistake
Deleted User - mate, everyone makes mistake dont fucking go around archieving everything if you already emailed them they will sort it out but if they are too lazy to do so or are unprofessional you could post it here
Deleted User - did you read the fucking community guidelines? contact the person/host first about the issue and if they refuse to do anything then you can post them here, your just being a dick not going to lie
gavinx2031 - Zachery *you're

Please learn to spell if you're going to harass someone and be a overall dick, and act more professional as using profanities is not professional at all

Also i already emailed them about then issue awhile ago üëè
dvrfgre - gavinx2031 This fucking kid, go back to drink your milk. This is not wayback machine, if you want to archive it, just do it at your basement.
Deleted User - gavinx2031 Are you sure you want to do this? drama.gg is not a 'professional'
community in any way, this was also stated by Sloth himself. And second of all im not harrasing you, i'm telling you to buzz off because your literally not following our community guidelines
dvrfgre - gavinx2031 *doesn't
dvrfgre - gavinx2031 It's not privacy statement, it's privacy policy, dumbass!
