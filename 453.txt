yeyeyeye - You probably never heard of leetnodes as its a shit hosting company owned by $MoneyBoi$#0999

Yesterday they were exposing email addresses of there users.

They say its because of them migrating all users into there new database but that is a lie.

Because they are still using tickets to create users and servers.

I think they were doing this to get there customers hacked.
RumGuru - yeyeyeye Discord Link?
Knifeworm - As the owner of leetnodes we were not exposing emails we were trying to migrate everyone to our new database. And the emails were ###### out so they cant see most of the email.

If you have any other issues with us and more exposing to do on here i will love to here it
ItsYaBoyBanana - what's their website

Knifeworm - ItsYaBoyBanana As the owner of leetnodes i can tell you no exposing of emails were going on and terms of service and privacy policy are in the work as the working on the new dashboard for users of our hosting.
Yie - Lmao "sakura hosting" - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-05/1620211427-589818-screenshot-2021-05-05-18-43-09-22.png
Knifeworm - Yie We used to be called sakura hosting. and to be far. i forgot to change the rules thats my bad
Bruhmeme - yeyeyeye they are moving members to a new database for an actual website(i know this since I am helping them with the new site). And most of the email was blurred so I don’t get your point on “leaking" emails. They just trying to move people to a better and more optimized website. And they aren’t "shitty" they have plugins and mod support for there mc host side which many hosting services don’t have. I don’t want to be involved in the drama just trying to explain what happened Edit; added a new point and fixed some spelling
TheMGDEV - yeyeyeye Glad you saw it too. However, I saw it when it was just theemail@#####.com, which is very very insecure.
Knifeworm - TheMGDEV Hello i am would like to inform you which i did in your post. the email when was posted was always # out. and the edit was to create a spelling mistake that he made. And i would like to say as well you have no evidence of the unedited message.
