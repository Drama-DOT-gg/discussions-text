FlyingMane - Right, so i wanna start off by saying Badsk is in fact Plexed 


Kind of portante to notice his bio lol

"New way of hosting bro" ðŸ’€ðŸ’€
Not to mention that he opened like 20 hosts and all of them ended up failing badly

Now Badsk has 3 different servers : he has mc world, hexit and his support discord

Needless to say, his reviews are absolute shit and his staff are beyond unprofessional 


(Notice secret)

Now, their trust pilot is shit as well. They seem to have inflated their recoews, probably by making their staff give them a 4l5 star review or by giving rewards for fake reviews 

These are actual reviews:


And these are inflated reviews obviously written by mods 

Here is the proof he is a mod lel

Their usernames are the same and i feel like he made more than one account to 5star ping

Plexed does inv rewards (which is.scummy as shit)


And his shitass staff are backing him up. He makes false claims about being the best host which just shows how self delusional he really is. He is too far gone 


Now this brings to another issue: how is he hosting so many people's servers? 
Keep in mind his server has almost 5.4 k people 

I think that he is yet again abusing card payments and all of this is just a huge data leak just waiting to happen. It might seem reliable because it has a big following and lots of kids trying to host q free server but this is just sad.

FlyingMane - Sorry if I made grammar mistakes, i am on my phone
Dubss - FlyingMane Hello. I have many questions about this thread. Plexed in fact, has absolutely nothing to do with mcworld. I am the owner of MCWorld and Plexed is not.

I am aware of the unprofessional staff team we have at MCWorld and I will be working to get rid of a lot of them and bringing on many new ones.

I have never encouraged or asked our staff members to review the hosting. In fact, I had encouraged them to not write a review about it. Nothing I can do about it if they do. 

There is absolutely nothing wrong with doing invite rewards. It's a way of getting members and it works. It isn't against tos (that I know of) and it's just a easy way for our clients to get resources for their servers. It benefits us and our clients.

Our "shitass staff" did not back him up. I typed ".-." because he has pinged twice. I was just trying to help a friend by posting his host in mine because mcworld has been down for some time because of some personal reasons with myself.

Plexed may be carding.. I have no idea. I provide all the nodes for MCWorld and I pay for them all. (I can send proof when I'm on my computer). 

If you have any further questions please contact me on discord!
