Hey so I remember using their host which has been running 2 nodes with literally only 15GB ram instead and upto maybe 500 members into I don't really remember so I just joined and saw the owner or an admin say that they're resetting their node due to lag and are giving us 24 hours to backup but then he's like screw this and resets the node and puts only 5 allocations lol an I swear it was the laggiest shit I've ever seen the server took forever to start.

The other part is their donator node just got boomed and here's something a donator said:
This was sent by my friend as he does not own a account on drama.gg


If you can clearly see the caps about zeusnodes its like the access was just made public or something because they never share their passwords
the admin aka the one who handles havengames network had lost all their hard work just because of some data breach because havengames has been running for a few months with no issue and right after moving to zeusnodes they got boomed just in a few days.

Can someone find out more about zeus nodes? their discord is invalid and Whenever I try to create a server the data resets the next day - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-09-03/1630685266-271774-image.png

Dviih - What a good host - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-09-03/1630686918-479622-screenshot-20210903-133458-chrome.png
Dviih - Also what does they mean by "100% DDOS Protection" normally is used a "tier list" for that like basic, advanced  etc - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-09-03/1630686985-132660-smartselect-20210903-133610-chrome.jpg
Kowone - Dviih pretty sure it's 100% non-existent ddos prot
Dviih - Kowone lmao yes
DeadBush - idk if he still is one of the owner but it was named as exotic nodes before and here are some stuff

old thread https://drama.gg/d/857-acehosting-privacy-policy-generator-freenom-domain-and-a-lot-of-swap - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-09-03/1630687473-129789-image.png
tan_playz - looks like they did allocate proper slots but the resets were too much
tan_playz - DeadBush Nah zeusnodes is different its not of exoticnodes and I think zeusnodes was closed but the panel is still access able
Scripted - Hey there! I am from ZeusNodes
Scripted - i may not be executive in discord server but I do own zeusnodes
Scripted - lemme say them to rank me
Scripted - tan_playz 
i think some fucking staff in zeusnodes got the dashactyl or api token leaked
ZeusNodes - xD - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-09-03/1630693629-498166-image.png
ZeusNodes - Btw he is making his host private. And he use statup credits from aws. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-09-03/1630694228-340353-image.png
ZeusNodes - tan_playz havengames network had lost all their hard work just because of some data breach because havengames has been running for a few

Btw this happen because Heaven games enemy (Minetrax) owner is staff there and have access to panel. So it is 100% sure that, minetrax owner deleted there server.
MrHealer - Hey, i am  not a part of zeusnodes Any More But , i Want to Say They Only Have Issues With Their Dashdactly after , one of our staff member ditched us id it is 878209278320705536 , he raid and nuked our discord also leaked our freebie data here are some for that what happen. 


Well i think you should give zeusnodes a little time to fixed all thier issues ðŸ˜Š. 

Also the one open the issues with zeusnodes name is not a zeusnodes executive. - https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/868022667415023646/881772281565679656/unknown.png
ZeusNodes - LMAFO I didn't leaked any data  and I didn't nuked any nodes I just only nuke discord server. And you all are scammers. And I want to ask @Sloth that using startup credits from aws for paid host is scam or not?
ZeusNodes - And please learn real meaning of ditched. I was executive in zeusnodes and when they disrespect me after doing lot of works, They also abuse there preivous staff. There owned told me to make miner on there afk page. And they told me that they only hire me for miner after that they give me load of managing all things. And when ever I pinged related issue is solved then owner abuse me.
Owner never reply to tickets. Only I reply. Then to he abuse me infront of everyone in annoucements.
IoNetty - ZeusNodes Using startup credits proves that you don't have money to spend, noone uses aws otherwise.
IoNetty - ZeusNodes Miner? I thought arctic did that, confusion?
IoNetty - Also, I usually say this to hosts. If you need some help making it or with some problems, just ask me. I'll help a bit. Sometimes I can understand the feeling of a drama.gg thread being made on you, as long as it isn't pretty bad i'm willing to try and help get you back on your feet in most cases.
ZeusNodes - IoNetty Yes they have 2 things: arc , btc miner.
IoNetty - ZeusNodes Oh, well anyway. Need any help starting back up? It looks like this thread did something.
ZeusNodes - IoNetty Nope I left that shit host a while ago. And I heard that they are making it private host.
IoNetty - ZeusNodes Private host? Never heard of that crap in my life.
ZeusNodes - IoNetty I also never heard of that thing. Maybe they will use nodes for there own. Or for there friends.
Scripted - IoNetty 64gb on aws, how can we get that for free.
Scripted - IoNetty 
It means the host will be shutdown and will only be private, Destiny will become CMO of LegacyNodes.
demon - IoNetty not the threads dude when my own Frnd betrayed me, I felt bad 
guys talking about the free thing which we made 
I dint add so many server to that node. 
And speaking of it being private, this is was always a host for my frnds and for my server. I just have a try of making to public. And the guy who is speaking as zeusnodes you have proven that you are the guy from that ss in which you clearly told I was not the one to nuke , you are the one behind this mask. And after he nuked and deleted all the servers I did not this public again. Website everything was in build stage this all happened in the span of 3-4 days. (Re read my post ))if any mistake from my side I apologise for that and to the user who used it for that span of 4 days
demon - Scripted the guy behind zeusnodes name donno these things
Scripted - Scripted 
LegacyNodes has no dataloss over the past 20 days nd we are purchasing a new node.
demon - Scripted we dint do any kind of data loss to. I was not only the owner of zeusnodes at that time ,
the guy in the ss who told I only and stuff . He has access and did these things overnight
IoNetty - Scripted Free plan can be abused for a few days then banned.
IoNetty - demon I don't understand your grammar or spelling, sorry.
IoNetty - Scripted Huh alright
IoNetty - Scripted 20 days? What about within your whole host.
Scripted - IoNetty we never got banned
Scripted - IoNetty It never got a dataloss, it has been 20 days since it released.
Scripted - Only host which I was owner at got dataloss is FusionHost.
RusshvithSJ - ZeusNodes i was a staff at that time and the issue was with neither of us it was a mistake done by havengames i have talked to them if you want ill get whole staff team here.
