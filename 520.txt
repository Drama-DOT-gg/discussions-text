FlamingPhoenix - guitarhost.xyz a free host which gives 2 free "dedicated servers", They are actually just pterodactyl docker containers. Let me start explaining,

First of all, They say they have no ToS or Privacy policy. They also say they own their servers though i have ran an ip lookup and all of their vpses are from the following companies:

Digital ocean, Runs n2.guitarhost.xyz and panel.guitarhost.xyz. 
Microsoft Azure, Runs n3.guitarhost.xyz
Contabo, Runs n4.guitarhost.xyz

They are most likely using a free trial for the vpses except contabo since it doesn't have any free trials as far as i'm aware.

FlamingPhoenix - They say they have their own owned servers though all are rented/leased and most of the servers they have are obtained via a free trial.

Ayaan - FlamingPhoenix okay sooo first of all pranking a member is just a simple thing bruh + that you are telling me abt free trial VPS, we bought everything and we have invested a lot of money for buying VPS + domain mail server and everything. You just said right that telling members lie. Note this PRANKING A MEMBER is simple stuff
FlamingPhoenix - Ayaan "Pranking member" 

I'm sure you weren't "pranking" and you were trying to tell people fake news. You have no ToS or Privacy policy so it isn't just pranking.

Can you use grammar please?

Got proof you paid for stuff?
Ayaan - And before saying bad service check thank us channel, everyone's review, and I have seen you all going every small hosting services and making fun of it, like WTF let them run their services like they want, you didn't given them money or something, did you?? Soo just mind your own business man. üëçüèª
FlamingPhoenix - Ayaan 

They are thanking you for a service that you haven't even paid for. You have just straight up ignored my question about you having proof for paying for your vpses. Guess you don't, huh?
FlamingPhoenix - What we want? We just want for people not to be involved in data loss, It's unbelievable on the amount of free fake hosts opening up and no i don't think i want to mind my own business, Thanks.
Ray - Ayaan  'and I have seen you all going every small hosting services and making fun of it, like WTF let them run their services like they want'

We are here to defraud and expose people, you can't just let them run their servers like they want, there are rules.
Ayaan - FlamingPhoenix 
Wait till he comes on, I will definitely post the proof here - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-19/1621454992-267990-screenshot-2021-05-20-01-39-12-60.jpg
Ayaan - Ray we just started our services soo. We are making our ToS

Jxck_KV - because no
theMackabu - Ayaan lmao amd64 also known as x86_64 is an cpu architecture, not cpu brand.
RusJS - Ayaan That isnt just the case. You are putting users data into risk. Espicalky having no Pruvacy Policy for users to know what they are registering to
BaconHead - FlamingPhoenix They should have a tos and privacy policy + they are friking lying about having dedicated servers in their home when they should tell the truth but even if they told the truth about using vpses then what's the problem with using free VPSes? Some may not have money for vpses
Foxyfox - BaconHead If they don't have money for vpses then why tf start a host. There's plenty of wrong in using free trials to start a host, One of them being: What will happen after the trial ends? Will all users just loose their data just like that?

Ayaan - Here, I don't want to increase this mess. Yes I accept my fault. But it was not real, I was just bored, just thought of pranking, and of course I was going to tell the truth, but this came out. And sir, we are not scammers. And yesterday I was telling to only 1 member. If also I would tell this stuff to 10 members then you all can say, we lie to members. But it was only 1 guy. I'm really really sorry about whatever happened. Sorry for this controversy. üôÇ, I just started this host because I had a dream to make a good host. üôÇ, Btw how are you all doing in this this covid situation, is everything good in everyone's house?
FC5570 - This dude (the owner) got immature kids as dev's/admins in his server,  they have absolutely no idea how to act professional:

vikingww2 - FlamingPhoenix for the record, these are stolen images from a legitimate hosting provider called dan. He's been providing free hosting for users for a few years, is legit and is based only on donations. Kinda hurtful that he would claim those are his servers. You can check out the real images in #server-pics in discord.gg/dbh. He also posted a few videos. Any purchases he makes, he most of the time asks the comunity wether we want for example more storage or more ram. Overall a really friendly guy.  (Just thought I'd explain where those images originate from.)
Deleted User - They stole CentroNodes' logo animation, and they claim that it was for their beta testers Twitter. Wdym, if it was for beta testers, then why it's public? :KEKW:

They are also claiming that they're giving 2 free dedis on the same Twitter account, and they have the same excuse, the Twitter account is pretty old, and that it was for beta testers.

Itz_Ak - Anybody know the fact that @Chirag Is an IP grabber? He have shown me my IP and even told my location, acc name. He pretends that others are grabbing his IP while hiding the truth he is an IP grabber. Tip: He even friks up his friends IP and will misuse it. Just be carefull when dealing him, dont share data with him.

BaconHead - Itz_Ak is there a problem with him being gay? Anyways, how does posting some screenshot of some dude using alts make you gay? Stop being a bitch and homophobe.

Pornhub - I can confirm. they actaully watch new users servers too. Plus they are using free trials. i have now reported them to contabo as the are using a customer account not a business. against their ToS. Along with digital ocean too
