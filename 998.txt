Aaron_ - hello there, so today someone created a ticket on a server that I moderate and he wanted to partner. Here's a screenshot.



When I joined their server I couldn't find their Terms Of Service nor their Privacy Policy. Their nodes were also a bit too overpowered considering they just had 7 paying users.



Heres the ticket recording: https://streamable.com/2wyb2f

When they told me they resell nodes from https://darynode.online/ I immediately joined their discord server and created a ticket. Here's how it went 




We voice chatted for about 5 minutes and I got a lot of information about Unseen And smr. smr scammed the owner of DaryNodes for 1000 INR. Kiku the owner of DaryNodes sold them a VPS that was worth 2000 INR but smr just sent him 1000 INR when it expired or something like that.



While I was asking for privacy policy and ip address of their 3 dedi's he created a ticket on DaryNodes and started begging for their privacy policy and an ip address to one of their VPS. 

Here's the recording: https://streamable.com/n2phqx

Aaron_ - They also copied DaryNode's ToS And Privacy Policy. 

DaryNodes ToS: https://hastebin.com/kidixokapu.sql
The ToS that Unseen sent: https://hastebin.com/ajomimuxuy.sql

The PP Unseen sent: https://hastebin.com/omusoyozus.sql



Kiku claims that its the same as his but I can't see a privacy policy in his server so can't tell. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-09-13/1631551604-982359-image.png

hampter - https://hilexnodes.xyz

Still no legal informations + they banned me for arguing with them LOL
RAM1759 - Really Hilex Nodes Is a scam Hosting They scammed me The Dary Nodes too This smr was one of the co founder of Dary Nodes And kiku also was founder of Hilex Nodes I think they are using free vps and scamming people They have no indepenent vps
Aaron_ - RAM1759 I doubt it, Kiku was always on dary nodes side and smr was hilex's. I used to have a good relation with kiku and I had learn a ton about them. They both hate each other and they gain nodes in different ways. They do not share vpses.
