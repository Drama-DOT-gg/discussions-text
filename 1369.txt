RapedHost - It has been a while writing a thread but here we are. A user called: Akame (Akame.#3339
/324984665838583809) talked about Do Not Disturb "being gay". The fact that he said this alot was getting on my nerves. I told them stop joking about me and other stuff as I hate jokes. Well, he and his friend "Imad" (Imad#9793/511212466487689216) started participating. Eventually THEY removed me from their group chat. I blocked them because it's the right choice for me to do so because I got annoyed at them. Eventually Akame banned me from his server, proof:  for something that happend in DM and not his server, weird though. A few hours after my dinner he dmmed me including this chilish picture. . I think there will be more pictures soon though. - https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/891366730876715008/928717689856331826/unknown.png
