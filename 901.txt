Jerome - I know Freenom is bad, no matters free or paid domain they just bad at doing it but I don't think we should judge people/company just because they use free domain. 

Companies and creators use free domains because it's free and they don't need to spend any money to start using it, it's good for development and early stage. Some people/company might be providing good services and helpful for the community. Drama.gg isn't built for "exposing companies and people using free domain", it's meant to "exposing fraudulent companies and people" and I don't see any legal issue against free domain. 

When you should hoax a people/company using free domain?
unprofessional
scamming
shady link and transaction (such as through crypto currency which cannot be refund)
illegal activities 

Should I use free domain?
I wouldn't recommend someone to do so if you have budget as your SEO and spam mail rate is high and in most cases you will not rank in the search engine and getting your mail at your customer spam folder. It didn't give good first impression for people as well.

Anyways, it's just my thought about it. You are welcome to share what do you think about it and why.
