His MC-Market sums it up, he's was the owner of Jetnodes and some other crappy host. He sold dedicated servers to a much more stupid me and some of my friends.

Was on the old summerhoax, have no idea why it isn't here - in the morning I'll post more evidence but just look at his mc market scam reports.
MCKingSam - Dear Akash,

Thank you for taking the time to address your concerns regarding myself. JetNode was a legitimate company ran by myself in 2019 and all customers were happy. I don't see how it was a scam at all. Regarding the "scam reports", everyone who purchased a dedicated server received a full refund. I've offered to show you PayPal screenshots 100s of times, but you've never accepted the truth. @AYS himself can confirm that all dedicated server customers were refunded.

I do not wish to go into anymore detail as this has been settled for over a year now. You clearly are some sort of clown as you've attempted to hoax Contabo, and now myself for something that happened over a year ago, and wasn't even a scam.

I will not reply to any further comments made on this thread. You can send me a DM if you have anymore concerns.
Akash_ - MCKingSam cap, where's my refund. You blocked me on discord and never ever even dared to refund me. Maybe I was nieve and sent a friends and family payment, probably was tbh.
Akash_ - MCKingSam I found your deleted discord account - why not contact me on your new one - your proof is very compelling.
