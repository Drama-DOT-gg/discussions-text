Maru05 - So, recently, I have been getting a lot of these openseacoins.com scams. If anyone is reading this, and won some money, do not get too excited. It is just fake numbers. Do not do what the instructions say, and if you share your details, R.I.P ur cc lol. Heres some obvious scams for me to expose.
