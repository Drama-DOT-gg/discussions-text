vainki - Hello! I come to this platform to expose a guy named Daxo, formerly called DianixGTX. First of all this guy and his hosting already has several threads on drama.gg.


SharkHost, Relefree and Relehost are from the same guy, this hosting was first called Relehost, then Relefree and now it has changed its name to SharkHost.

Well, let's go to what we are interested in, first let's talk about when this hosting was called Relefree. 

First, this hosting stole the css style of the login page of my dashboard, I attach proofs where I show it and later he admits it.




And here I'm going to show when he admits that if he was stolen, I helped him with something so I asked him not to use my css.

After that he made us a drama.gg to my hosting, which by the way he deleted it and then I found out that he scammed several people with vps, and I went to ask him about it and he blocked me.

After all that, some time later he literally stole the website from a hosting company called ColourNodes, he literally didn't even delete the css credits.


Also, actually and this is new. He copied from the maintenance page of my hosting lol.



I recently found out that their hosting is currently using Ionos Spain's free trial dedicated for their nodes. Basically what he does is hire a dedicated there because the first month they don't charge you, they charge you the following month. But when you hire them you use a card that then blocks it so that when the time comes that ionos wants to charge you they can't do it.

Translation of the screenshot: 0 €
The invoice amount of 130 € will be charged after one month.

Going back in time, this guy was using Google Cloud Free Trial for his nodes, then he started using Oracle Free Tier and is currently using ionos free dedicated server. Here is a screenshot of an ad he posted on his hosting discord, what a coincidence that the ad was posted a month after he contracted the dedicated hosting.

And this is not the end, there are too many things missing only now I must go to sleep, so I post this thread and tomorrow I will continue it. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-08-22/1661129877-826476-image.png
vainki - I'll leave one more thing before going to sleep, you can check out the free dedicated servers on this page.

vainki - Update: A colleague reported the machines two days ago by sending an email to IONOS sending them the IPs of their nodes and today their machines were deleted. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-08-24/1661372669-229796-image.png

Pelotudo_ - Are they really going to believe him?

First of all
vainki#0001 CEO of Starnode is trying to screw after ajneb97 finds his StarNode host scored 0.3
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhLJsVDVtN8

according to vainki#0001 we copy your css code but it is false we are willing to show it to check it
vainki - Pelotudo_ First of all, those are not arguments and I already showed the proof that they did copy the CSS, plus the owner of ColourNodes already reported them to DMCA.
Pelotudo_ - vainki I already saw but that is not proof that we have copied you we may have been inspired by you as you say the login code may be the same but not the entire page may be inspired by color nodes also you make a whole mess and then throw away the nodes ? there are proofs of payment of the nodes
vainki - Pelotudo_ No, there is no proof of payment of the nodes, surely they are passing them the capture of the purchase, but in the bank they do not charge them, they charge about 10-15 euros that are returned to the minutes and at the end of the month would be charged the full dedicated but they take out the money so they can not charge them, plus my friend reported the machines two days ago and they erased the machines, that's weird no? If they paid there would be no reason to delete the machines, a company does not delete your services just because. And the evidence of the copy of the CSS is above, it is literally the same variable.
HackioCrack10 - Pelotudo_ When i join you "hosting" one member group said. "We pay or nodes, They are down because a maintenance." I told him the real reason after that the ban me if you pay your nodes then why you are banning me from your main hosting?
Thats Suspicious
LlamaFachera - XD
Pelotudo_ - Starnode Oracle FREE?

Why?

first of all these days the STARNODE Hosting and did many nodes reset
because they are from oracel free.

Honestly, we don't have proof, but what considence they have that just passes the oracel free license.

It will not be to renew it and change to another free account?

Those messages were extracted from the Starnode discord server - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-08-26/1661527920-136291-image.png
AngelGuerrero - Exactly, they also say that they have invoices but they never show them if it is true that I sent vanki the invoices here. It is more always put as an excuse that it is not fair that free users have more resources than paying users and so take advantage of each month to change your account to another free. I also noticed that they use 6 machines that are the exact ones that the free trial gives you. In short starnode FREE TRIAL

Pelotudo_
vainki - Pelotudo_ I left out this drama.gg but, first of all, why do you change the topic? In this drama.gg we are talking about SharkHost, NOT StarNode, stay on topic, and secondly, I did not delete any node in this time, and the times that the servers were deleted were done by me and it was about 3 months ago, I did it because I had to delete the panel database because it was corrupted by the mysqldump that I did from the previous panel machine, and if I have to delete the panel database I have to delete the servers so I did a general deletion of servers, and also those deleted servers is only delete the folder /var/lib/pterodactyl lmao, you can see yourself that the IPs are always the same. And third, not because a random says that, means it's true, besides that capture is not the StarNode discord. bruh
vainki - AngelGuerrero First of all, what horrible English, secondly, when starting StarNode i showed the invoices, moreover with the same logic that SharkHost also show the invoices, which is no good even if they do, because the invoices are editable, this is all a matter of morals and logic. And the Oracle free trial only gives ONE Ampere machine which is ARM architecture and only has 24gb ram and 4 cores. And by the way... Disguise better that you are NOT a friend or a multi-account of Pelotudo_
DarkKing - It's funny to see that they keep arguing without evidence, the sharkhost guys got their asses hurt too much when they got all their servers deleted for scamming hahaha
Jellz - 🤣
