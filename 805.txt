Abooz - So this bryce guy came to my host and was happy with the service until today when i refused to give him staff. He wrote a 1 star review over not being allowed to be staff (deleted it later on, kid scared). Now is ddosing me for being banned. - https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/730023081489203241/865173065837838336/unknown.png
