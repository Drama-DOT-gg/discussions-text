and
https://www.reddit.com/r/TLAUNCHER/comments/tg9j70/exposing_bs_of_the_owner_large_server_of_a/

Hi, I'm u/FireTrail846 , an ex member of the Minecraft server R-SMP. I am here to expose the owner of the server. (Note to moderators: if you see this being reported, it's the admin asking it's members to report the post, as he did before Also, credit to u/Inevitable-Cry7214, u/SortFit, "Sir William Domfoe Chad üé©" (the owner of funcraft), and u/padfoot9446 for supplying me with proof.


The owner and co-owner IP-grabs members of his server. Here is an example of one of his many victims-https://ibb.co/PwFjFH4 Alternative link: https://rsmp-exposed.am0g.us/raid-assy-man/PKFTNDt8

The owner has doxxed (leaked the information) of one of his moderators (ask u/SortFit for more information, he is the one who got doxxed)

When I was still a member, I saved the server from a hacker. The co owner then tried to take all the credit (in reality, he did nothing at all) The co owner also has threatened one of my friends with DDOSing. - https://ibb.co/rstz3DJ

The players are very toxic. (image of members saying the N-word-https://i.imgur.com/n2H88Vh.png Alternative: https://rsmp-exposed.am0g.us/raid-assy-man/IND4E6TT)

There is no anticheat. (i think they put one, but i haven't joined their crappy server in a really long time so idk)

The owner crashed and griefed a different SMP server (named funcraft), just because it was a competition to his SMP server. Another player made a post on it- https://www.reddit.com/r/smp/comments/pvsl5s/rsmp_is_rading_the_funcraftsmp_and_hacking_into/
Archived version in case raid tells his members to spam report the post: https://www.unddit.com/r/smp/comments/pvsl5s/rsmp_is_rading_the_funcraftsmp_and_hacking_into/

Pictures of them griefing the different SMP- https://ibb.co/c1LJHNk Alternative: https://rsmp-exposed.am0g.us/raid-assy-man/QHHmkz6L

After they destroyed the other server, the owner framed one of his moderators to have done it- here is a leaked photo. https://ibb.co/JxqTPMY Alternative: https://rsmp-exposed.am0g.us/raid-assy-man/qliEhBbD

If you ask raiduzzaman about them griefing funcraft, he will say that the person who griefed was a different person on reddit who found out that there was no /login. Yes, this has happened before, but it was on a completely different occasion.

I spoke with the moderator whom the owner framed, and these are his responses-

Here is his proof that the owner framed him - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Vfum_j5sIU2QZu6G-p2A85vlBpMb62PM

Explanation of the pictures-

Emperor_g is the moderator, his reddit account is SortFit

Domfoe Soot is the owner of the other SMP server, who leaked his information because he thought he was the one who destroyed his server.

SortFit saying what happened (this is an archived post because the owner of R-SMP reported his post until it went down.) https://ibb.co/cTFwD0p



Raiduzzaman said that he griefed funcraft because they apparently nuked the Discord server of R-SMP. I have talked to the owner of Funcraft, and they admitted to doing it. Why? Because the ex-co-owner of the server, Zachery, leaked the IP-addresses of multiple of his friends. When I told Raiduzzaman this, he didn't answer and just called it "old news."

People who witnessed Zachery ip grabbing Domfoe Soot-

Swap#3414

Losare#6854

USERNAME 3

People associated with Zachery-

AEugene#5558

soistas#5962



Raiduzzaman also nuked another SMP lately, (named Solecraft SMP) owned by one of Domfoe Soot's friends. -https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/880764481624506419/953642156915056690/unknown.png

He admits to it here- https://ibb.co/3FgWQjc

They're probably just going to say that this was inspect element, but here's a picture my friend took on his TABLET. You cannot use inspect element on a tablet. https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/952951753719050280/953658413978648616/unknown.jpeg?width=243&amp;height=406 (it's at the bottom, might be quite blurry on a computer but that's probably because tablets and computers have different screen res)



TLDR summary of this drama:

Zachery leaks ip adresses of doomburs friends to assert authority for some reason

Doomburs friends nuke rsmp discord

Raiduzzaman removes access to the server he gave them (funcraft)

and then raiduzzaman griefs funcraft, their server

A lot of people are suspecting raiduzzaman for nuking funcraft

Raiduzzaman frames emperor_g

Doombur leaks emperor_g's ip because he thought he was the one who destroyed server

Emperor g manages to reason with doombur

People try to expose rsmp but raiduzzaman spam reports their posts

that leads to now



So that's it. If Raiduzzaman tells you to spam report this post until it goes down, please do know that you are on the bad side, not the good side. Anyways time for the special mentions of people who helped me expose rsmp-

Sir William Doomfoe Chad üé©#0951

hatful √Üsir#6476

K4TBO1#8106

u/SortFit

u/Inevitable-Cry7214

u/padfoot9446

and NeonX who helped me make alternative links for images 

Some other pictures collected by K4TBO1: https://imgur.com/a/7Xtk1bv

ok thats it theyre gonna be exposed imma post this post, hope people see how bad rsmp actually is. Time to post!

P.S. if there are any wrong stuff / things that were worded incorrectly i will be editing this post.

Quick edit: zachery has a botnet he uses to ddos here it is-

Picture of botnet gui or hud idk what to call it- https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/880764481624506419/953999875668852786/unknown-1.png

Another edit: raiduzzamans reddit account is u/raiduzzaman3

Edit: raiduzzaman is also anti ukraine: (i dont want any political arguments in this thread) https://discord.com/channels/@me/954025263019196456/954035088440561704

https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/954025263019196456/954027592623730718/unknown.png

Raiduzzaman has admitted to doing (some) of these stuff in a recent announcement in R-SMP-
Image 1: https://rsmp-exposed.am0g.us/raid-assy-man/iPbhn1c6
Image 2: https://rsmp-exposed.am0g.us/raid-assy-man/lA59Hi1s
This is not true, funcraft did not get jealous of R-SMP. They nuked the R-SMP discord server because the co owner, "zachery" leaked their IP-addresses for no reason. (fun fact: zachery is in drama.gg! https://drama.gg/u/Zachery)
I have a pretty controversial opinion about these messages in the announcements: Raiduzzaman is using a psychology trick. Basically, when you lie, you put a bad thing about yourself in the lie, so people believe it. In this case, he admitted to framing Emperor_G. 
That's all for now, I will be editing this post (can i? i don't know how this forum works) to add more things if needed in the future.
Edit; please dont make raiduzzaman popular- https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/954744883627819079/955015726920503326/unknown.png?width=669&amp;height=406
NeonX - I had to repost this in drama.gg because they kept on spam reporting the post in reddit, which caused my reddit account to get a 7 day suspension.

NeonX - Tazhys what do you mean "good drama"

raiduzzaman - i amma try to ignore the things happened 4 months ago
Zach - NeonX AEugene#5558

why is my son associated with this?
Zach - NeonX People who witnessed Zachery ip grabbing Domfoe Soot

lets get real here, if you have a problem with me having your ip why even join the server?
Zach - FatGrizzly 

FatGrizzly hi bb

hey  ‚ù§Ô∏è
eraters - Zach aren't you like 9 lmfao
Zach - let me just wrap this up, raid here is the owner of R-SMP and hes been bugging me for months now to join his smp and when i did join i was given co owner, one thing i did notice is that MANY of the members were using 'hacked' clients and thus i banned them, simply put the author of this post is merely throwing a tantrum due to me banning him, anything related to raiding of servers has nothing to do with me as that is all Raid's doing. Next up for IP logging, that is a feature every minecraft server possesses(except if they manually remove it ofcourse), and for me threatening to DDoS them, i never did DDoS anyone of them

next up, i dont possess any botnet and the 'specs' are complete 'bogus' me and soistadas merely were there to troll him, and its not a 'botnet' if there are 0 bots/devices'
NeonX - Zach "bb?" So are you online dating now? Did you really have to make a new account? Isnt @Zachery already here?
NeonX - Zach oh nice you dont have any proof. Show proof that you dont own any botnet. Dont be the guy that has dozens of proof against them and just says "thats fake."
Zach - NeonX "bb?" So are you online dating now?

yeah? whats wrong with it? ü§®
Zach - NeonX uh, i just dont?
Zach - whats your proof that i DO have a botnet?
Zach - that picture clearly says '0' devices, and what proof is there that its 'mine'
NeonX - Zach - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-03-21/1647840096-72713-image.png
NeonX - Zach also there's another account of you with the same pfp and name and he's literally talking about ddosing right now, its in another thread near this one
NeonX - Zach it's very unethically illegal and proves you are a kid
NeonX - eraters uhh what is a GCP
NeonX - Zach also why did you make another account just use your https://drama.gg/u/Zachery account
NeonX - Zach true, many members were using hacks. some werent even abusing them. Do you seriously think I'm still crying about you banning me? Do you think i want to be unbanned and play on your shitty server?
NeonX - Zach you two sound like cnc slenders in roblox aww üòä
Zach - NeonX not my server.
Zach - NeonX what the hell is that?
Zach - NeonX so your saying its wrong of me to be in a relationship with grizz?

Zach - NeonX uhh, as to what i know im sure im using my own 'skin' and how am i in any way 'emo'
Zach - NeonX uhh?, since when is it ethically wrong for 2 males to have feeling for each other
Zach - NeonX ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
NeonX - Zach i'm not saying youre an emo im just setting an example of online daters
NeonX - Zach when did i know that you both were males? i'm not saying i hate samesex dating but what im saying is online dating is cringe. ### Also, why are you using a new account in drama.gg? Why dont you use @Zachery ? Are you trying to avoid publicity?
NeonX - Zach you are trying to avoid publicity ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
NeonX - Zach tell me why or im going to ping everyone associated with you in this forum
Zach - NeonX cough cough grizz is a ocean's length away so this is how we contact each other ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Zach - NeonX uhh sure?
Zach - i really couldn't care less about who is here
Zach - im using this account because i lost access to my first one. Check the last active date on my other account then check the date of creation on this account.
FatGrizzly - NeonX yo yo, I'm not dating him or shit, it's just a nice way to call someone in drama, get your thoughts off.
Zach - FatGrizzly you broke my heart üíî
raiduzzaman - Zach 
LOL
kids like @NeonX  should get a job rather than wasting 4 hours on drama.gg and reddit
NeonX - raiduzzaman - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-03-22/1647965028-29635-emotional-damage.gif
NeonX - raiduzzaman oh no what a great insult i am so offended and hurt üò≠üò≠
Zach - NeonX you really did just take 2 days to type that out.
NeonX - Zach thats because you guys didnt reply
NeonX - NeonX so i decided to start conversation
raiduzzaman - Zach 
btw gimme ur discord
NeonX - raiduzzaman you already have his discord
NeonX - raiduzzaman stop fighting just apologize and confess to your fanbase instead of saying that proofs were done on "inspect element" even though it was took on a PHONE and looking like a dumb ass
Zach - NeonX i can vouch that raid did do all this, he dmed me everything he did
NeonX - Zach send me screenshots, using phone on amoled dark mode, and in the discord app with a betterdiscord theme
Zach - NeonX lost 2fa on the account, 2 weeks ago.
Zach - NeonX i aint gonna violate discord TOS
NeonX - Zach sure, you dont want to violate the discord TOS but you have violated multiple cybercrime laws. Idiot. Its not as though discord cares about betterdiscord users. They don't care about the reports you send them about some random betterdiscord user. They're just too lazy to add those features betterdiscord has.
NeonX - Zach send me screenshots on a phone in amoled dark mode and in normal mode, send me screenshots in the discord app as well (asshole raiduzzaman got a 3 day ban in drama.gg XD ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£)
NeonX - Zach anyways, no one has been banned for using betterdiscord
Zach - NeonX violated multiple cybercrime laws

which crimes exactly?
Zach - NeonX not gonna do it.
Zach - i dont trust random software on the internet
NeonX - Zach ddosing without consent and doxing without consent
NeonX - Zach if you dont want to use BD then just send screenshots on a phone, or take a video of you showing the message on your pc(dont use screen recorder use ur phone recording your monitor)

Zach
NeonX - Zach stop acting dumb
NeonX - Zach sure then why are you using software, any software can be classified as "random" if put on a randomizer
Zach - NeonX doxing isnt illegal. and no i dont ddos.
Zach - NeonX I have my own way of counting what is 'secure' and what is not.
Zach - NeonX randomizer? what the hell is that
NeonX - Zach not knowing what a randomizer proves that you are a kid
NeonX - Zach i dont exactly have proof but you once got my ip, threatened to ddos me and then my internet stopped working. -annoynis
NeonX - Just send me screenshots of raid confessing in ur dms like u said
Aplimmm - :iceey:
Zach - NeonX umm? excuse me?. you just made that up.
Zach - NeonX man probs lives in a place with bad internet if it keeps cutting off
Aplimmm - NeonX the person that say other ppl is a kid is the real kid 
-isaac newton ceo of gravity
Zach - NeonX I WOULD if i didnt lose the 2fa to my account.
Zach - Aplimmm uhh pretty sure Isaac newton didnt say that‚Ä¶
Aplimmm - Zach how you know your parent not evem alive in that time :p
Zach - Aplimmm umm, true‚Ä¶. üëÄ
NeonX - Zach my internet is 50-60 mbps (with two people using it)
Zach - NeonX thats pretty slow, and assuming that your not using fiber. maybe it did get cut off.
Zach - it isnt about internet speed, its about the connection from your ISP to you.
NeonX - Zach a randomizer is a tool that picks a random thing from a list
Zach - for more info DM me on discord dchu096#8700(raid dont even try friending me)
Zach - NeonX AND HOW DOES THAT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH ME SAYING I DONT USE RANDOM SOFTWARE ON THE INTERNET?
NeonX - Zach dchu is a different person b
Zach - NeonX we swapped usernames.
Aplimmm - NeonX my grandma dosent know wht that thing is does that make my grandma a kid?
NeonX - Zach it is verry fast for the country i am living in
Zach - NeonX it also depends on the infastructure.
Zach - because there are 2 probable causes, either raid ddosed you(maybe) OR your internet cut off
NeonX - Aplimmm fuck off
Zach - NeonX AYYYYYYY FOLLOW THE COMMUNITY GUIDELINES
NeonX - Zach just send the screenshots of raid
Zach - NeonX NOT UNTIL YOU READ THIS WHOLE THREAD https://drama.gg/d/1845-rules-and-information/3
NeonX - Zach SEND THE FUCKING SCREENSHOTS
Aplimmm - NeonX why whould i do what a 12 yo say?
Zach - Aplimmm good point.
Zach - NeonX N O.
Zach - feel free to dm me on discord tho üôÇ
NeonX - Zach Use your common sense.
Just don't be a dick. That's about everything this rule is.

Advertising/offering services is strictly prohibited.
We are not an advertisement forum, for that stuff you should go to something like¬†MC-Market.

Treat others with respect.
Regardless of role, rank, gender, age, affiliation, etc. Any kind of discrimination is prohibited.

Do not harass members.
If a member wishes to not be contacted by a person, respect the person's decision.

Do not discuss illegal operations.
Such as hacking, DDoSing, doxing, leaking, or threatening to attack the server/other users.

Do not use alternate accounts.
Unless within reasoning, and the request has been approved by a Drama.gg team member.

Ignorance of the rules is not a valid excuse for breaking them.
If a team member pursues a punishment, which is within reason, there is no need to fight it.

DONE SEND THE FUCKING THING
NeonX - Zach DIDNT ASK SEND THE SCREENSHOTS STOP AVOIDING THE QUESTION YOU TWISTED DARKWEB MINDSET
Zach - NeonX DM me on discord first, im lonely ‚òπÔ∏è
NeonX - Zach NO YOU FOLLOW THE REAL LIFE LAWS AND GUIDELINES SO SHUT THE FUCK UP AND SEND THE SCREENSHOTS OF RAIDUZZAMAN CONFESSING
Zach - @Robert  does this count as harrasing? ü§î
NeonX - Zach good for you, of course no one will be friends with an asshole that defends people who ip grab doxx and ddos
Zach - NeonX im not defending raid in anyway lmao
Zach - im quite fed up with him at this point.
NeonX - Zach go on moderators, you know that i'm on the right side here, these assholes have harrassed and ddosed multiple people
Zach - but i cant send you stuff if your gonna harrass me üò≠
Zach - NeonX right side? uhh you do realise they dont care if you break the guidelines.
Aplimmm - NeonX i want be friend with zach üòÑ
Zach - NeonX Treat others with respect.
Regardless of role, rank, gender, age, affiliation, etc. Any kind of discrimination is prohibited.

despite affiliation all must be treated with respect.
Zach - Aplimmm dm me on discord.
Aplimmm - Zach Aplimmm#0001 üòâ
Aplimmm - NeonX in anyway i also gonna defend ppl that doxxed if there wasnt any falid proof üòõ
Zach - Aplimmm üòè
NeonX - Zach I CAN NOT DM YOU ON DISCORD, YOU BLOCKED ME DUMBASS
Zach - NeonX wait what
send me your user ill unblock
i have bed memory üôÅ
NeonX - Zach I'm under the impression that not sending proof of a bad person knowing that the bad person is bad, and having proof of it is hiding proof and therefore defending that person.

Zach - NeonX ayy dont do that to my man comfyy
comfyy - Zach yeah. you do ask for perms, atleast from what I know

Zach - I invoke the fifth, and i will not speak until you take off your beluga PFP üòÅ
NeonX - Aplimmm i use the beluga pfp not because i like it its bc its my go-to pfp for accounts that i wont use long term like this
NeonX - Zach i dis invoke the fifth because in my country we do not have the fifth thing and so that you  look like a dumb ass crying over a cat picture
Zach - Heh? Whats that? Couldn't read your bad english.
NeonX - Zach I dis-invoke your "fifth" because in my country, we do not have laws like "The Fifth" you are talking about. In the Philippines, we have a different system of laws unlike you Americans.
NeonX - no dchu, i will not unblock you, i dont even know how to play roblox
Zach - NeonX uhh
Zach - NeonX why block me üíî

Zach - NeonX that is 1.1.1.1 sir.
Zach - NeonX I JuSt WaNt My OnE MiLlIoN DoLlAr PeT SiMUlAtEr PeT
Zach - NeonX LMAO WHY ARE YOU USING TOR FOR 1.1.1.1
raid_sus - NeonX 
He isn't on anyone's side
but maybe raid and zach are the same person
maybe
like there is a chance
Zach - raid_sus if that was true, my brain would have probably melted by now, i have been 2 people at the same time once, but being 2 ENTIRELY different people thats impossible
NeonX - Zach oh, that's possible. Raiduzzaman is a 14 year old claiming to be 23 24 something. Meanwhile, zachery is apparently an "adult" but still plays Roblox.
NeonX - Zach the hell is a one million pet simulator pet, i dont know how this game works but one million is a lot, are you serious?
Zach - NeonX nothing what wrong with playing a game ü§∑
Zach - NeonX no idea
raid_sus - Zach 
nothing impossible to me
2 chrome profiles lol - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-04-02/1648905779-4521-image.png
raid_sus - NeonX 
repeating the statement again
i am 25 not 23
NeonX - raid_sus @Robert @raiduzzaman made an alt
NeonX - raid_sus 
You don't act like one.
You online date minors in your server. Pick being 25 or 14(your real age.) If you insist on being 25, then you get exposed for being a pedophile, and possibly get doxxed. If you are 13, people might forgive you because, you know, its just a kid!
You can't pay crypto.
What kind of 25 year old wastes time on discord
Aplimmm - NeonX yk 13 dosent count as a kid? It count as a teen and im pretty sure alot of 25 yo spend most of the time on discord and what is the connection between 25yo to paying crypto?
Aplimmm - NeonX and im sure you like 12 or 11
Aplimmm - NeonX go to youtube search roblox and you will find alot of adult youtuber there is even some that are married and have kids üòõ
NeonX - Aplimmm raiduzzaman can't pay for hosting, pretty sure he uses free falix
NeonX - Aplimmm maybe, at least it's a 11 year old with a very wide range of vocabulary.
NeonX - Aplimmm one of the anti rsmp members tried to scam raiduzzaman out of $20 to "take down the posts", also 25 year olds would have a job at this point and raiduzzaman is online like 8 hours a day
NeonX - @raid_sus @raiduzzaman 
Pick one:
Option 1: Be 25 and be accused of being a pedophile because you online date kids in your server
Option 2: Be 14 (your actual age) and get off easier, but you'll still look like an idiot.

(Side note: Your discord account was created on October 13, Tuesday 2020. You once said (in the old rsmp discords) that you created your account when you turned 13.
Aplimmm - NeonX not everyone does have a job at 25 dum. Some ppl might choose to continue collage for better job in future a kid like you wont understand a thing
Aplimmm - NeonX that technicly possible lmfao since 11yo now in 5/4th grade so the vocabulary should be good
Aplimmm - Aplimmm i was saying you like 11yo/12yo bc you just act like one+ you dint understand alot thing about being a 25 yo you just like having a 12yo brain or we can say dumb
Zach - NeonX raid dates who now!?, also yes he is 14
NeonX - Aplimmm ik about college degrees, okay?
NeonX - Aplimmm i'm not 25. I'm 16.
NeonX - Zach he apparently has a gf named "Imagination" and before that he had a gf named "Alliah" and he told me in my dms that he has a gf irl
NeonX - Aplimmm Well then, how old are you?
Aplimmm - NeonX you dum? No one say you are 25
Aplimmm - NeonX liar ik you atleas 12 just see from way yoh act, you dont even understand smthing simple
NeonX - Aplimmm What kind of 12 year old has better grammar and punctuation than most people in this forum?
NeonX - Aplimmm You type like an eight year old.
BreadKitten - aplim getting fucked cus of his grammer :lol:
Zach - NeonX ahh yes, the alliah girl(its his alt btw)
Zach - NeonX Probs some raiduzzaman supporter
NeonX - Zach what? Alliah is raid's alt?
NeonX - Aplimmm Anyways, I'll correct this sentence.
"Liar, I know you're 12. I see it from the way you act, you don't even understand something simple"
Suggested insults you can use on me:
"Cope"
"Didn't ask"
"Don't care"
"Your Mother"
Zach - NeonX Those insults match Aplimmm, immature. üòâ
Zach - raid_sus Fool, I don't use chrome.
Aplimmm - BreadKitten SHUTUP
Aplimmm - NeonX a smart 12yo?
NeonX - Aplimmm 12-year old's can't be that smart.
Aplimmm - NeonX you dumb? Its possible
Zach - NeonX well that is actually possible‚Ä¶, after all we are comparing them to you not the average human being.
NeonX - Aplimmm * Are you dumb? It's possible.

NeonX - raid_sus why should you care if someone uses the browser they want
NeonX - raid_sus choose one:
Be 25 and be accused of being a pedophile because u date kids in ur discord and (possibly) get doxed by someone who hates pedos
Be 14 (your actual age) and get off easier but you'll still look like an idiot
NeonX - raid_sus i don't know what nodes are and I don't care

NeonX - Milan1000 the main post isnt boring lol
Milan1000 - NeonX i just speedran looked through it and it just looks like ppl are fighting about smthing
Zach - NeonX no its overallocated.
Zach - and he uses oracle free trial
Milan1000 - Zach bro there aint no way üíÄ ive actually used oracle free tier and it fucking sucks ass
Milan1000 - and lets not talk about how annoying oracle can be anyways
Zach - Milan1000 yeah exactly
Aplimmm - NeonX try to get some knowledge before doing smthing
Milan1000 - Zach they might as well use falix or sum shit like that cuz falix is defi better than oracle or they could use centro basically there are tons of better ways to setup a mc server then use oracle
Aplimmm - Milan1000 i can just pay 1/2 bucks for freetrial on  azure
Milan1000 - Aplimmm azure is weird ive tried getting a trial on them for yk to mine on their instances until my trial is over but those fuckers keep declining my card

NeonX - Zach pls dont give me a long winded monologue on website and server hosting
Zach - NeonX thx for the idea! It will be in your DM's tommorow! ‚ù£Ô∏è
Alaalolz - im kinda late for this post lol
CharityLexus - this post is literally just people fighting over grammar üíÄ like bruh who cares about grammar this is a casual forum where people expose skids, not a court lmao
Zacch - CharityLexus i guess so, haha
raid_sus - NeonX

Milan - ngl this thread is just kids fighting about some fucking mc shit
Milan - and about grammar, who gives af uck if someone has shit grammar this is a drama forum
raid_sus - 280th post lmfao
Aplimmm - 281th post lmfao
NeonX - raid_sus @Robert this guy evaded a 3 day ban by making an alt, raid_sus is @raiduzzaman 's alt
raid_sus - NeonX 
just send me your email and i will give u a 32 gb ram server to prove u wrong
NeonX - raid_sus nah ur just going to send me some virus file or some virus email, or you'll sell my email to advertising companies.
NeonX - raid_sus also i searched what pterodactyl panels are and i don't need a website, sorry.
NeonX - raid_sus and how are you going to send me a server anyway? "Free RAM Download"? if ur going to send me a server, make me some falix nodes panel or a shockbyte giftcard
Aplimmm - NeonX ptero arent only used for website lol, it can be used for multiple things, alot free host also use pterodactyl
Aplimmm - NeonX lmfao so dumb, he can simply create an account for you on his pterodactyl panel and he can just create the server simple
NeonX - Aplimmm I don't use websites, that's why I don't know them. That does not make me dumb, grammar boy.
Aplimmm - NeonX you dont use website? Oh so you use application for drama.gg?
NeonX - @Zachary @Zachery @Zach - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-04-06/1649223435-996127-screenshot-20210927-220812-discord.jpg
Aplimmm - NeonX what wrong with that? Ip logging is normal alot big servers use that. As long as they dosent leak the ip its fine and legal
Aplimmm - Aplimmm and just for information there is tons of plugin that log ip like essentialx
NeonX - Aplimmm but... but... they leaked some person's IP. have you even read the main posts?
NeonX - Aplimmm no, what I mean by that is I don't buy stuff like "Domains" or host servers, so I don't know what those are.
Aplimmm - NeonX i read but i wont click random link to just see proof
NeonX - Aplimmm yeah, do you know that the first post on this thread is a fucking COPY PASTE of the original reddit post? Do you not know what REDDIT is? Are you that much of a fucking idiot that you don't know what REDDIT is? Reddit is a SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANY WITH FORTY-EIGHT MILLION MONTHLY USERS. That's the amount of users DISCORD had at May 2017. That's one of the shittiest things that came out of your mouth, considering that it throws out shit every message. (Insult credit:k4tb01)
SLiOg - NeonX (btw im milan but i keep getting banned) my guy an ip? that is nothing all that can do is get him ddosed i mean just setup ddos prot or get a new ip or get a dynamic ip, and sure u can also get his local location and if he somehow does end getting doxxed SOMEHOW it wont rlly matter basically leaking his ip doesnt matter nothing bad will happen.
NeonX - SLiOg still, ddosing is both ethically and lawfully illegal.
Aplimmm - NeonX ik it is copy paste. I just say "i wont click random link" Are you that dumb? I dint say i dosent know what reddit is or its wasnt copy paste i just say "i wont click random link" Thats all
NeonX - Aplimmm you lost the argument, do you really think reddit is a random ip grabber link? You're making it sound like the link is harmful. ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ Stop supporting rsmp, there's dozens of proof against them.
Aplimmm - NeonX you are so dumb. I dint talk about the reddit link i talk about other link dumbfuck. Like example https://rsmp-exposed.am0gus.us even a dumb ppl will atleas think its redirect to rick roll or smthing. I suggest you get a better brain
NeonX - Aplimmm oh. That one was made by upload.systems (basically some sharex upload thingy, made by players in the anarchy minecraft community i think?) well, you do have a right to be scared of links like that.
NeonX - Aplimmm then you could have just said that you thought the am0gus.us domain was weird. Open it in tor browser if you want.
