Two - A ton of people say some servers are "toxic", and drama.gg is "toxic." "Toxicity" is an opinion of manner probably.

I would personally say drama.gg is toxic (but the community is pretty cool when you get to know them, and you aren't hated), but:

Would you consider drama.gg toxic?

I'm fucking bored, so I'm putting up this shitpost poll.
moviear - imo half the time drama.gg is no less toxic the people it exposes, half of this site is 9 year old skids trying to prove their "hosting" site is better than the next dudes
Plexed - Drama.gg consists of salty 9 year olds exactly
Triassic - 90% of the people who consider drama.gg toxic are really just skids running scam hosts really.
Aaron_ - Triassic True, most of the users in the drama.gg discord server are so cool and chill.
Dviih - Two I'm just toxic if ur a skid / scammer if not welcome
Tato - Most of the times when swearing gets to us is because at that point we've had enough of your shitty excuses, poorly done photo editing and, bad English (the last one is really a 50/50 chance)
CharityLexus - Two I would personally say drama.gg is toxic (but the community is pretty cool when you get to know them, and you aren't hated)

this is exactly what i think, but not necessarily toxic, just rude
Two - CharityLexus that makes sense yah
