BlackCat - hi so there is a host called virtualnodes. They give out free and paid webhost

They use vps with 1gb ram, 1 core, 20gb disk for webhost. And they host paid webhost on the same machine
They dont have TOS &amp; Privacy
One of executive was literally begging for vps in my friends gc untill someone from the gc give him vps
FatGrizzly - BlackCat give some proof bitch, and give discord link too
BlackCat - FatGrizzly 
this is him begging

i got banned from virtualnodes cant send link - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-11/1620707898-164583-image.png
BlackCat - oh yes they use freenom domain also
Spo3ger - This all is not true our host is not even done yet
RusJS - Spo3ger Firstly, do not start  the host without funds and you should already have a copy of legal documentation as you are making it seem like the host has already been released.. When apparently it isn't? Just don't start the host when you are not even HALF WAY finished, it just makes no sense okay. Hope that your host can probably improve a little bit more?

Chirag - wait, is this the real HasX from paqet? if yes, then virtualnode is garbage.
HasX also admitted to raiding discord servers.
Deleted User - PugRug His name is HasX, yet he still doesn't have his tos or pp.
Deleted User - PugRug calm down, it is illegal, so just report &amp; move on..
Deleted User - BlackCat They use vps with 1gb ram, 1 core, 20gb disk for webhost. And they host paid webhost on the same machine

oml, can I get invite pls üòè üòÉ
RusJS - HasX umm a report wont do anything just for that.. youll just receive a warning from discord that its false
RusJS - KylePlays I did not understand a single word you just said.. Also Contabo is really decent, explain how it would make the host bad if your literally using it
BlackCat - oh btw the owner of virtualnode is raider. Before virtual and mine host merged and techy did just steal the discord and bannd everyone from it
Spo3ger - BlackCat our host never beg for vps and we are buying vps from hetzner
Yie - VirtualNodes kinda renamed to SkylineNodes.

EmeraldMike - CAUGHT IN 4K - https://i.mythicalkitten.com/f1qPYSU.png
Sappy - EmeraldMike 

Ok first of all I did not decide on Mofh. I don't even have credentials or access to it. Second I am not begging I am just encouraging them to buy a paid plan, it is still their choice if they want to or not.
Daniel2519 - Hi, I'm daniel.py, administrator of VirtuaNodes.
As you mentioned at the beginning, we have a VPS of 1 GB of RAM, but later we added another node (A raspberry PI) and that is why we made the decision to use a free service like MOFH to host the web pages of our free clients, which I do not understand that It is wrong because we are only trying to give customers the best possible experience and regarding a comment that says "THEY ALSO ARE BEGGING FOR YOU TO BUY!" We are asking customers if they have the opportunity to contribute financially to the hosting and that is why we are using MOFH and Sappy already has the credentials.
All the best.
Daniel2519 - EmeraldMike Yes, we mencioned cPanel becouse MOFH use cPanel.
Yie - Daniel2519 but later we added another node (A raspberry PI)

Best way to get yourself here lmao. Also, PI for free server hosting? Nahhh
Daniel2519 - Yie Yes I know thats why we transfer all our websites to MOFH
Saqib - Isn't MOFH free reseller web hosting?
MythicalKitten - Saqib yea
Daniel2519 - Saqib Yes it offer unlimited reseller for free.
Daniel2519 - You can now order a free hosting on http://virtualnodes.gq
EestiMngur - what the f is this shit host, even dont have https

mtt - Daniel2519 LetsEncrypt is fucking free, just install the addon
mtt - my messages are sending like two times help
Daniel2519 - mtt We are using free reseller host, so I can't install any plugins
Daniel2519 - Daniel2519 IDK why my message is like deleted
EmeraldMike - Daniel2519  They use something LIKE cpanel. do your research
Daniel2519 - EmeraldMike Yes I know is a modification of cPanel called VistaPanel
Daniel2519 - We are going to have a SSL cert for all our sites soon. üôÇ
EmeraldMike - Daniel2519  Also ad moment
luca - Daniel2519 mate, mofh doesn't use cpanel
