LucaDev - We do not state anywhere that we have to give people proof of our invoices.
Literally uses a random screenshot and video which proves nothing.  
Doesn't have any evidence of us using a Free trial. 
   
Answer to NEXGEN_GAMER:   
We stated that we're moving to our own nodes in a couple of days in the latest announcement.
   
Answer to Scripted:
We have a similar ToS, however it is not copied.
