J0SH - lmao I love hosts like this, so full of shit
Parallax - I don't know if they're using GCP credits as if I'm not mistaken you can not have instances with over 16GB of ram while using credit.
INfoUpgraders - Parallax 

I can create one with 16vCPU's and 128GB ram lol - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-03/1620077888-763462-image.png
TtomiiiHCF - the boy is leggit wtf
INfoUpgraders - TtomiiiHCF totally bro
Prudentia - lol its fine to use google cloud with or without free credit, as long as you don't abuse the system
TtomiiiHCF - Prudentia totally, I do not know the truth that they are complaining.
Phase - send discord of them
J0SH - Prudentia 
Of course, It's fine to use Google Cloud for your instances but not when you clearly bullshit about it. They were claiming that the GCP node was a proxy to avoid DDoS attacks, which is obviously bullshit.
INfoUpgraders - Phase banned me for no reason ;(
