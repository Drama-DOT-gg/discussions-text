Deleted User - Idk found some host thats using a stolen template (I think) and more.
Also they had a data loss hours after they release?

Why tf are they doing invite rewards if they dont even specify how much resources u will get:


they release:


they have a data loss:


Also they dont have a privacy policy or tos. - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-11-28/1606551260-939252-screenshot-20201128-0802542.png

Deleted User - Found out the website was using a free template not a stolen one
Tomas - This guy actually contacted me the other day &amp; asked for a web hosting plan from me (which costs money, obviously) and he wanted it for free.

He said he'd give me access to his Pterodactyl stuff. I told him he could probably host his website on his VPS and he said he didn't have it yet, so now if he has one it's probably really really small because he also claimed to have no money.
Daftscientist - how did he buy the vps?
Daftscientist - btw tf is my pfp here, its my old one....
Deleted User - not sure
Deleted User - cant get any info from it 
can confirm it isnt hetzner, contabo or ovh
Deleted User - *him
Albert - @ThatBad Do you really tink you can just join and create an winterhoax post just becouse he made an mistake and deleted all the data?
Albert - Like man we are 1 day old and you alerty doing that
Tomas - Albert Having a data loss on your first day just shows that you aren't really cut out for it lol
Albert - Tomas it whas bc he made an mistake trying to turn the node off and he hosts it at his house so
Tomas - Albert So, he hosts the node on his home network (on what device?)

Sounds like a PoundLand version of a host, bad equipment &amp; rubbish setup
Albert - Tomas oh so you want the node spects don't u
Tomas - Albert Send them. Hosting on your home network is generally a bad idea as it is.
Deleted User - They have no tos or privacy policy which just makes this worse
Albert - Tomas 4 cores (unknow)
Storage 800gb ssd
Ram 6gb whit swap (ddr4)
Triassic - Albert nice specs
AspectOfficial - on what is this shit hosted?!
Albert - Triassic yes
Albert - AspectOfficial on what is this shit hosted?!

on Anton's node
Deleted User - actually no its probably a dusty old pc
Deleted User - do I smell a scam xd? - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-11-28/1606569283-351495-screenshot-20201128-1313582.png
cat-toy - ThatBad do I smell a scam

I smell scam also
cat-toy - Scam confirmed by research
J0SH - Tomas lmao poundland you mean bins in the alleyway land
J0SH - Albert unknow didn't even finish the word so im assuming its an Intel Core 2 Duo
J0SH - Albert hosts it at his house lmao so many things can go wrong with that
Tomas - J0SH nah, love poundland!
poundstretcher has gone downhill though
Deleted User - Rizon has been shutdown
i think hes gonna make a new host
the fun begins again
also he has changed his name to "Lellis#0001"
J0SH - @ThatBad ngl you cant say much either with your 4 illegal hosts. srydenhost (reseller of falixnodes), viahost, exohost, and apparently srydencloud, none of which had GDPR lol
Iceey - J0SH doesn't mean they're illegal and you clearly don't seem to know what GDPR actually is.
J0SH - doesnt mean they're illegal? I didn't say the policies we're the only reason it was illegal lmao
J0SH - oh btw i would remove heimsnet from your name since i was told you no longer work there
Saqib - Albert Deleting all data is a MAJOR problem. you could probably get sued
