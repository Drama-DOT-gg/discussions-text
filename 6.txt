Mitu's context about experience with FabitHost:

So, i was working at my server, and i called Jay, the owner of the host where my server was hosted. He liked my server (BedWars) and i asked him if he want a tournament server. He said now, and after a few day he said yes. I helped him with some “Cards” (Claim your server, use code “XXXXX” for 15% free) and i made him an UI for his landpage. before that. So i started working, and the problems appeared. 10 Errors in 1 hour, i could not connect to the ftp, he fixed it and then they started again. I told him that if he will not fix the errors i will not be working anymore. He didn’t even respond. After this, we was calling in a group and joking. He left, i added him back, he left and unfriended me, and i told him what you will see in the photo below.


– i have the full rights to give it to someone else as the server mine. He didn’t even helped with something. I asked him to

So i can call him a thief, for stealing my work and abusing my kindness.

He haves a node with 30gb ram if i’m not wrong from Contabo that he can’t even fix.

Even Pamar paid me double for the work that i did him in the past.

Addition to the thread -

A few weeks ago I’ve purchased the advertisement service from FabitHost, payment went smooth and an advertisement was provided however after a while, the FabitHost owner did not provide me with the promised conditions. The first condition was to put my advertisement on the channel where no one could type.



However, the advertisement channel was available to type by anybody which resulted in their staff member (@Jedrik) to make random advertisements to hide my advertisement.

The 2nd condition was randomly made without my vote after the payment about “Owner of FabitHost (Jay/Snowman) will remove the advertisement message after 7 days” however he never mentioned that once I wanted to make the payment, which means I did not get my full service.

Then I’ve tried to contact the owner of FabitHost however no success, the owner refused to provide me with the full service with my promised conditions.

ALSO:

The owner of FabitHost is using the stolen/leaked version of other business’s system code and he is also trying to tell about it is not other business’s code.



Due to this fact, the hosting is also using the stolen system.

NEW DATA!!!
FabitHost have 1 node of 30 GB memory which is from Contabo, and in the machine - probably runs a lot of servers (let's say 500 servers OUT OF 1.6K MEMBERS WHICH ARE IN THEIR DISCORD GROUP!!!)

It's craziness! I would never recommend anyone to use FabitHost since not only they scam people, but they also provide bad service! - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-07-15/1594831078-452341-1593074143-792005-image.png

Pamar - Proof about only having 1 machine:
If Someone create the Minecraft server in FabitHost, it instantly goes to node01 no matter how, You won't see any other machine.


EDIT: If You ask how I know it is 30 GB memory, I sadly was employee of here and They had 30 GB memory contabo vps in those times. I checked their node01's IP Address and it's dammit the same as old 30 GB contabo vps! - https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-07-15/1594831563-520895-image.png

even LaMaker's host has more progress than your shitty ass hardware
Fx1z - Soy usuario de este host desde hace tiempo, se podría decir que estoy desde los 2k de miembros en fin.
El host a tenido muchos problemas los cuales se deben a la popularidad de el host el cual llevo a que se sature y diera errores de conexión con el panel o mientras estabas subiendo tu server.jar en el File Manager te saliera ese error terrible (lo recuerdo como si fuese ayer jaja) pero no solo era eso si no que existían 3 nodos los cuales estaban saturadísimos nos iba demasiado lento los servers pero era un poco jugable (en mi opinion), luego entre los 5k o 7k de usuarios el Grandioso "Jay" nos trajo un nuevo panel el cual era mucho mejor, pasaban las semanas y iban bien los servers pero en las primeras semanas de apenas instalar el panel habían muchos problemas como por ejemplo: el error de que no se encontraron usuarios con esas creedenciales o cuando los nodos se caían, pasaron unas semanas y todo parecía ir bien hasta que un día empezó a ir lento en lo personal no usaba el host yo solo escribía y ayudaba a algunos usuarios (aclarar que también fui un Community Support de ahí, no era el único existian unos 4 mas) ya para entonces entre los 8k de miembros o talvez menos ya no era 24/7 aunque esto ya estaba mucho antes, la nueva norma consistía en que si tu servidor pasaba 15 horas online procedía a apagarse (para evitar el lag) aunque no creo que ayudo mucho luego ampliaron los nodos con mas memoria ram y mas cores para ese entonces iban muy bien los servers pero tambien se elimino un nodo o lo movieron (también hay un nodo donador que esta en USA pero a ese ni caso porque nadie compra o por lo menos nadie pregunta por el) yo tuve que moverme al nodo1 que mucho pero mucho antes era un nodo muy muy saturado pero ya no lo era aunque no por mucho hasta ahora van muy algo bien pero no es algo que te sorprenda la verdad solo con tener el Paper y sin nada de plugins te andaba a unos 18 o 19 tps pero eso era la semana pasada, ahora es un caos (en mi opinión) hay un error el cual afecta a todos a continuación la captura de pantalla de un usuario:   el servidor no nos quiere iniciar ya que al parecer el startup no quiere leer el minecraft.sh aunque revise el archivo y no contiene nada algo que para mi me parece raro yo que se, no soy ingeniero experto en eso del Pterodactyl y el multi-egg, volviendo a comentar que tal va y es que el Sr. Jay no se reporta ni nos ha dicho que pasa, ningun anuncio o aviso sobre ello (asumo que talvez este trabajando en solucionar ese error o simplemente lo quiere dejar por alto) puede ser el fin de Fabricio Host?

PurpleCube - I tried FabitHost a long time ago, and they gave me like 8gb of RAM and multiple cores. Nothing would work, the server could not even handle it.

Now I know how to host things on my own hardware, I don't use free hosts anymore, I laugh at them.
