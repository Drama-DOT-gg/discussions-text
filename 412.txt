MysteriousK69 - Hello, everyone!

So, I am here today to talk about Olympus Hosting.

First of all, I would start off with their TOS. It's not even anything proper and does not clarify a lot of things https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/828989597978591252/835873329356996649/Screenshot_212.png. (Please correct me if I am wrong)

They also claim to have datacentres, but are reselling Contabo &amp; OVH, and it's so obvious, its just sad to see him deny it. Specially after he, himself admitted it. The screen shot's contain him saying that they have datacentres, saying that they are partnered with Contabo and OVH after I said that their plans are the same as Contabo, him admitting to reselling Contabo &amp; OVH, then denying it https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/828989597978591252/835873332876017674/Screenshot_215.png https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/828989597978591252/835873329088954398/Screenshot_213.png https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/828989597978591252/835873332980219924/Screenshot_214.png https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/828989597978591252/835873336205639730/Screenshot_217.png. 
(is he fine mentally?) Even if you were to say that they are not reselling Contabo/OVH, it does not make sense for a company with a total of 250 Discord members (not even customers) to have multiple datacentres, does it?

They also have a website hosted on 000webhost, https://olympushostinger.000webhostapp.com/. I am pretty sure it's their free plan. Also, they claim to sell domains, but don't even have a domain themselves. When I asked about it, he said that they are waiting for the developer to put it up with their new domain.

Oh, and their staff is unprofessional and can not even be bothered to capitalize the first letter of the sentence.

They also just ignore the questions they do not want to answer.

After this, I just got banned with no reason specified so I could not get anything else on them.

I am sorry about some of the screen shots being glitched.

Deleted User - Wha- what does Defence Minister role does bruh.


And one more thing I'm pretty annoyed about. Most of their messages is in FULL CAPS. Like why. As if their messages are unreadable. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-04-25/1619360980-403044-screenshot-2021-04-25-22-28-06-71.png

ikr lmfao
Chirag - Chycada I think he means that the internet speeds are so high that chrome crashes when we run speedtest.
that's just dumb smh
typicalGta - Chirag lmfao, first of all, they should use cli even if that were the case but what's more important is that chome has never crashed for me running speedtests of over 40+ gigs at least in my experience so it clearly doesn't make sense (I'll admit the counter thingy does lag a bit at high enough speeds)
Yie - Chirag Hi Chirag, I moved account to this new one. And truthfully, running a speed test with a "very fast" internet speed wouldn't crash the browser, no matter how. The browser crashed probably because the machine probably low on RAM? Or too less processing power. Idk. Saying the browser crashed because the internet speed is too fast is too idiotic. Even if God forgives them, but I won't. ðŸ¤£
Chirag - Yie ikr, they're dumb.
they could rather use inspect element to edit the result than actually saying that smh
