MysteriousK69 - Hello, everyone!

I recently found this company going by the name "Moon Host".

There is just so much wrong about this company, that it would take years just writing this post so I briefed it out a bit.

First of all, the CEO is a kid (Mr. P Willy LR, the owner of NexusNodes, there is a post about it here) who is underage to even be working. I could not find the proof for it, but he did admit on being 16.

Their staff is unprofessional too, and clearly does not know what are they even doing. I even asked for the privacy policy &amp; but got banned (Which was, later given. Wrote about it in the post below).   

I was banned after the conversations shown in the above pictures, and no reason was specified for it. 

When I talked to a staff member, they were really unprofessional too, and gave me reasons like "Because you would harrass members", "ruin the host", "dox us", "ddos us", etc. While not being able to give proof to any of it, then accused me of trying to impersonate the CEO Willy.       

They are also using Vultr (prob free trials), and Contabo. (Don't get me wrong, nothing wrong with Contabo, but thought I would mention it to avoid misunderstanding) 

He also accused me (Lawliet.Host) of abusing Digital Ocean's free trials, while we use Contabo on all of our nodes, and "ipscanned all the ips". (We do have Digital Ocean and Alibaba Cloud's VPS's added to our panel, but there are 0 servers on them. They were added for testing the quality.)
  

All words like "drama.gg", "fake", etc. Are banned to even say in their Discord server. That just shows how scummy they are.  

I reviewed their privacy policy, and its full of fake information. I am 100% sure its copy pasted from somewhere else. They say that they will tell the users what information is being collected and why, but it never is. In the next ss, it says that they will receive information such as email, name, etc. When we contact them, but that's not possible, because you can only contact them through Discord. They also claim to use Google adsense, but they clearly do not have it on their website. (https://moonhost.ga | https://moonhost.xyz)   

As I was writing this, Nai Aypro and toxic_recker (the people who helped me with this post) got banned. 

Now, abusing Hetzner too? (I apologize for the bad screen shot, I just spammed the button to capture wht I could before he deleted.)


After this, I just did not have the energy to continue.

Thanks for reading this, sorry for any grammatical errors. English is not my first language.


Update: The other CEO of the company reached out to me. We sorted everything out, and he was an understanding person. The ban on me has been revoked, and he apologized for the staff, and accusations on Willys behalf. The only thing left to do is remove Willy from the company, as he is still underage to be owning a business. - https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/828989597978591252/835818993633853450/Screenshot_137.png

The ban on me has been revoked, and he apologized for the staff, and accusations on Willys behalf.

MysteriousK69 - Hello, everyone!

I recently found this company going by the name "Moon Host".

There is just so much wrong about this company, that it would take years just writing this post so I briefed it out a bit.

First of all, the CEO is a kid (Mr. P Willy LR, the owner of NexusNodes, there is a post about it here) who is underage to even be working. I could not find the proof for it, but he did admit on being 16.

Their staff is unprofessional too, and clearly does not know what are they even doing. I even asked for the privacy policy &amp; but got banned (Which was, later given. Wrote about it in the post below).   

I was banned after the conversations shown in the above pictures, and no reason was specified for it. 

When I talked to a staff member, they were really unprofessional too, and gave me reasons like "Because you would harrass members", "ruin the host", "dox us", "ddos us", etc. While not being able to give proof to any of it, then accused me of trying to impersonate the CEO Willy.       

They are also using Vultr (prob free trials), and Contabo. (Don't get me wrong, nothing wrong with Contabo, but thought I would mention it to avoid misunderstanding) 

He also accused me (Lawliet.Host) of abusing Digital Ocean's free trials, while we use Contabo on all of our nodes, and "ipscanned all the ips". (We do have Digital Ocean and Alibaba Cloud's VPS's added to our panel, but there are 0 servers on them. They were added for testing the quality.)
  

All words like "drama.gg", "fake", etc. Are banned to even say in their Discord server. That just shows how scummy they are.  

I reviewed their privacy policy, and its full of fake information. I am 100% sure its copy pasted from somewhere else. They say that they will tell the users what information is being collected and why, but it never is. In the next ss, it says that they will receive information such as email, name, etc. When we contact them, but that's not possible, because you can only contact them through Discord. They also claim to use Google adsense, but they clearly do not have it on their website. (https://moonhost.ga | https://moonhost.xyz)   

As I was writing this, Nai Aypro and toxic_recker (the people who helped me with this post) got banned. 

Now, abusing Hetzner too? (I apologize for the bad screen shot, I just spammed the button to capture wht I could before he deleted.)


After this, I just did not have the energy to continue.

As I was writing this, Nai Aypro and toxic_recker (the people who helped me with this post) got banned. 

Now, abusing Hetzner too? (I apologize for the bad screen shot, I just spammed the button to capture wht I could before he deleted.)


After this, I just did not have the energy to continue.

You are free to add anything to this post if you feel like it. Their Discord: https://discord.com/invite/kvx4FG9U5z

Thanks for reading this, sorry for any grammatical errors. English is not my first language.


Update: The other CEO of the company reached out to me. We sorted everything out, and he was an understanding person. The ban on me has been revoked, and he apologized for the staff, and accusations on Willys behalf. The only thing left to do is remove Willy from the company, as he is still underage to be owning a business. - https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/842607156661846047/843488415479758848/Screenshot_509.png

MysteriousK69 - The staff is also toxic.

MysteriousK69 - LMAO https://moonhosts.com/ is a thing already
NotAypro - Also, turns out that their admin is the owner of NexusNodes. Which, as mentioned in the post by MysteriousK, has a thread on drama.gg
Willypro7 - Hi i am here. First of all, UNDERAGE? I am a 16 yo. 
Our staff is professional, just mohamol334 is based on the Spanish support as he Spanish.

I have proof of him doxxing, https://doxbin.org/upload/WillyPro7, that's me! Made by MysteriousK. The reason was not specified because we needed to ban you asap, You where harrassing staff members very hard. We are not using vultr, we are using contabo and we will move to velocity soon, that image it's fake.

Your host was accused because you accused mine, and yes you are using digi ocean and alibaba cloud, they for your nodes. If someone wants to check, can join https://discord.gg/kvx4FG9U5z and go to general chat. I  checked every ip of him, just two of them are real paid.

All non-related links are banned, not just drama.gg. "Fake" word is default banned for the discord bot we using, https://probot.io. Our privacy policy its not copied, we remade it. The information we collect is specified. We will soon use google Adsense, that's why we posted that in it. You where banned for: 1- Telling staff dumb | 2- Telling that we abuse vultr when clarely the ip shows CONTABO 3- ban evading with alts -4 harrasing users telling him to stfu and kids, 5- telling the host scummy without reason, not without reason.
z_t0ht - kid please stop trying to embarrass yourself like no wonder why your parents left you all you do is sit on drama.gg and talk shit about hosts
z_t0ht - MysteriousK69 kk so what it can have the same name
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7

Hi i am here. First of all, UNDERAGE? I am a 16 yo. 

Cool, you admitted that you are underage. I appreciate that.

Willypro7 Our staff is professional, just mohamol334 is based on the Spanish support as he Spanish.

No? All of the staff members shown there are unprofessional and even toxic.

Willypro7 I have proof of him doxxing, https://doxbin.org/upload/WillyPro7, that's me! Made by MysteriousK

Oh, yeah. That reminds me of you scamming me over a 16 gig VPS and $10. And, care to explain how does banning me prevent anyone from doxxing? Also, the doxbin post can not even qualify as a dox to be honest.

Willypro7 The reason was not specified because we needed to ban you asap

And, you never bothered to give me a proper reason afterwards too.

Willypro7 You where harrassing staff members very hard

I was not harrasing anyone. If I was, please send proof to support your argument and don't blame me without any proof.

Willypro7 We are not using vultr, we are using contabo and we will move to velocity soon, that image it's fake.

It is not fake. Proof of being fake?

Willypro7 Your host was accused because you accused mine

And, that is not a good reason to accuse pointlessly.

Willypro7 yes you are using digi ocean and alibaba cloud, they for your nodes

Want proof mate? https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/834801917967597658/835830631812431872/Screenshot_200.png US 1, HK 1, US 3 are the Alibaba, Alibaba and Digi respectively. The 1 server on HK is owned by me.

All non-related links are banned, not just drama.gg. "Fake" word is default banned for the discord bot we using, https://probot.io. 

Alright.

Our privacy policy its not copied, we remade it.

Then, why the fake info?

Willypro7 The information we collect is specified.

It is not.

Willypro7 We will soon use google Adsense, that's why we posted that in it.

Literally just do it once you add Adsense?

Willypro7 You where banned for: 1- Telling staff dumb | 2- Telling that we abuse vultr when clarely the ip shows CONTABO 3- ban evading with alts -4 harrasing users telling him to stfu and kids, 5- telling the host scummy without reason, not without reason.

Proof? I never did any of that.
MysteriousK69 - z_t0ht ok
toxic_recker - Willypro7 one second, you just copy pasted the same reasons as you did on discord for Nai Aypro LMAO

MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 Also, you have still not given me proof for the things I was accused for aside from doxxing.
NotAypro - toxic_recker Weird how they decided to ban me after I asked a few questions, and accused them of using free credits. Also, I wonder why did they delete the message which contained the IP of the nodes.
toxic_recker - NotAypro a failed attempt of trying to prove themselves clean
MysteriousK69 - @Willypro7 I wonder why did you delete this post?
""Not all staff members are toxic.

I never scammed you a vps lol, give proof?

I gave you the reason. Harrassing

Proof of harrassing: https://ibb.co/zfp8pZZ

It is fake, the vps was from contabo clearly.

You got just two alibaba, that means you have 3 digis and 2 contabos, you are using a digi one."

do you really call that harassment?
Willypro7 - I wonder why u kicked me from the group we where complaining saying " I don't trust willy, he can send an ss of here anytime. Maybe cause I got enough proof of harassing and ss I took for this moment?"
Willypro7 - toxic_recker No, he told that @MysteriousK69 harassed.
NotAypro - Willypro7 The group got fucking private info, I thought of you as my friend that's why you were in that group anyways but you can just leak anything from the group including people's name, IP and our VPS's password.
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7

Willypro7 Not all staff members are toxic.

Yeah. Though, many are. I can not say that others are not since I have not talked to them.

Willypro7 I never scammed you a vps lol, give proof?

Did you forget about it? You added a 1 gig VPS as a node and said "It's 16 gigs"

Willypro7 I gave you the reason. Harrassing

Proof of harrassing: https://ibb.co/zfp8pZZ

That is not even proper proof.

Willypro7 It is fake, the vps was from contabo clearly.

You gave 2 IPs, 1 was from Contabo and the other from Vultr as I mentioned.

Willypro7 You got just two alibaba, that means you have 3 digis and 2 contabos, you are using a digi one.

No? I mentioned it earlier, in case you did not read it, we have 1 from Alibaba, 1 from Digital ocean and 3 from Contabo. Anyways, this thread is about your shitty host. Make a new thread if you want to discuss Lawliet.Host.

Willypro7 No info is fake, literally what do you find fake in a tos?

I did not read the TOS. And, I mentioned everything WITH PROOF about it being fake in the privacy policy. Please, give us some proof of it not being fake.

Willypro7 It is, check. I already applied for Adsense that's why I putted their tos too.

Okay. I am not saying that you did not apply, I am just telling you to put it in AFTER you have been accepted and have implemented.

Willypro7 You did, let me send proof.

MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 No problem. Waiting for your reply ❤️
babyharpseal - toxic_recker Ok, first of all, he’s a normal member, not a staff member.

And as Willy said on Discord, the “Vultr" VPS it’s just for testing. We don’t have any member's servers on there.
MysteriousK69 - babyharpseal Just a member? He has ban perms.
Willypro7 - toxic_recker He was just an user, 
pink color is for users. But, he has reason because @NotAypro was also insulting him and telling him to shut up. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-04-25/1619349232-515556-captura-de-pantalla-2021-04-25-a-las-131350.png
babyharpseal - MysteriousK69 No, he didn’t?
Willypro7 - MysteriousK69 Man, https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/760419623950221342/835827206353715240/Screenshot_from_2021-04-25_16-08-29.png that shows that he has not perms
NotAypro - Willypro7 So you are telling me that you can give any user owner rank and permissions just to ban someone? I even saw you giving him Jr. Admin, but don't have proof as I got banned right after that.
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 My bad.
Willypro7 - NotAypro I did not give owner rank, proof?
MysteriousK69 - babyharpseal Yeah my bad. Sorry about that.
toxic_recker - Willypro7 my bad man, i didn't capture the screenshot of him while he had the owner role, the audit logs might have it but pretty sure you're never gonna reveal it

toxic_recker - Willypro7 can you give me the permission to view audit logs for a minute?
MysteriousK69 - @Willypro7 Why so cropped out? Mind showing whats above?
NotAypro - Willypro7 He said audit-logs not mod-logs and anyways you can just delete the messages in mod-logs and send the screenshot

this guy
toxic_recker - also it's impossible for audit logs to have no record of him considering the fact that he got member role added by a bot
MysteriousK69 - toxic_recker Audit logs show the actions performed by him, and not on him.
toxic_recker - MysteriousK69 oh yeah true, sorry my bad
MysteriousK69 - @Willypro7 Honestly, just give up on trying to defend yourself. You are just humiliating yourself. If you correct the mistakes, this thread will be deleted.
MysteriousK69 - toxic_recker no worries m8
toxic_recker - Willypro7 can you please filter it by Update member role action?
MysteriousK69 - @Willypro7 You wanted proof of you scamming? Here is you scamming a guy I sent to you to buy a theme for Dashactyl. https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/771714728368013333/817458719671451688/Screenshot_from_2021-03-05_23-38-57.png. And, here is you telling me that the 1 gig VPS is a 16 gig VPS you bought, and the proof of it actually being my VPS https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/771714728368013333/835844479004311552/Screenshot_202.png https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/771714728368013333/835844477050421298/Screenshot_201.png https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/771714728368013333/835844479876333578/Screenshot_204.png https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/771714728368013333/817416055135141979/unknown.png. Honestly, you are just the scummiest person I have ever met. I considered you as a good friend, and even gave you a second chance after all that.
MysteriousK69 - MysteriousK69 This is all I could find now, but you have scammed me multiple times for $3, 10, 10, and for some items too. Could not find proof so lets not talk about that for now.
MysteriousK69 - Also, I think it is pretty clear that @Willypro7 is not going to respond. Can someone add the "Confirmed" tag? Thanks!
Willypro7 - MysteriousK69 Hi i am here, I was just eating mate. What more do u want as proof?
eraters - ..you were eating for 2 hours?
Willypro7 - eraters Nah I was eating now, but I was with some friends, now, what more do u want lol
Willypro7 - toxic_recker Ok

MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 God damn, you take a lot of time to eat.
Willypro7 - MysteriousK69 Ok
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 Not update member. Update member role. Those are 2 different things.
MysteriousK69 - luffyy Thanks.
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 Yes. You still have not proven anything. Proof of you not scamming me a VPS? Proof of me harasing staff? Proof of your privacy policy not being fake?
Willypro7 - That's the moment where just toxic_recker joined - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-04-25/1619358117-596531-captura-de-pantalla-2021-04-25-a-las-154151.png
Willypro7 - MysteriousK69 The privacy policy it's just not fake, what more do you want me to provide? I literally just store what I tell in the Privacy policy. I cannot send the proof of the Harras because the server got raided, but as I shown in another pic, not aypro told that u where harrassing.
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 Alright. I will wait for Recker and Aypro to look at this.
toxic_recker - Willypro7 i would say again can you give me perms to view audit log for 2 minutes?
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 

Willypro7 The privacy policy it's just not fake, what more do you want me to provide? I literally just store what I tell in the Privacy policy.

As I mentioned earlier, you say that you use Google ads, while you don't. You also don't tell the users what information is being collected, and why.

Willypro7 I cannot send the proof of the Harras because the server got raided,

Are you really that desperate? Send ss of it being raided, please.

Willypro7 but as I shown in another pic, not aypro told that u where harrassing.

Just because he said that does not mean its true. I never harassed anyone without a reason, and never will.
MysteriousK69 - @Willypro7 Also, you gonna ignore the part where I asked for proof against scamming?
NotAypro - toxic_recker He won't, he is way too scared that he would get exposed lmao.
toxic_recker - Willypro7 
I cannot send the proof of the Harras because the server got raided

can you please stop lying? im in the server and I don't see any raids
MysteriousK69 - toxic_recker Watch as the server gets "deleted" because his account got hacked, and suddenly disappears from your servers list.
babyharpseal - toxic_recker A raid happened some days ago, but we loaded a backup from Xenon.
MysteriousK69 - babyharpseal What were the damages in the raid?
babyharpseal - MysteriousK69 Hmmm do I need to specify that? Anyways, all channels got deleted, and the server got a lot of pings, I can provide proof if you'd like.
MysteriousK69 - babyharpseal No need for proof. Anyways, if you can not give proof of me harassing, please don't bring it up. Also, all of the other reasons for banning me are complete bs.
Willypro7 - MysteriousK69 Are you really that desperate? Send ss of it being raided, please. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-04-25/1619365469-871834-screenshot-2021-04-24-10-04-27-56.jpg
Willypro7 - toxic_recker check
Willypro7 - MysteriousK69 YOU literally harassed, everyone in server seen. Just everything got deleted
Willypro7 - MysteriousK69 Just because he said that does not mean its true. I never harassed anyone without a reason, and never will.

Proof you didn't or something?
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 and, why so cropped?
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 are you literally mentally retarded? no one was active, and the only staff member kept on going off and on.
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 You are the one accusing, you are the one who needs to give proof. Please stop being retarded
MysteriousK69 - MysteriousK69 And, as always you ignore what you don't want to see.
Willypro7 - MysteriousK69 Idk personally I don't know which message refers to the one, can you please quote
MysteriousK69 - @Willypro7 So, shall we assume that you have admitted defeat?
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 Sorry, did not see the msg. I quoted it in the msg
 And, as always you ignore what you don't want to see.
BlackCat - how being 16 is underage? lmao
Willypro7 - MysteriousK69 no?
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 Yeah mate, read the message below it.
MysteriousK69 - BlackCat Not sure about the laws of Spain, but it is underage to work in most countries.
toxic_recker - Willypro7 i was away at that time and I don't have the permissions right now
GLCream - MysteriousK69 
As far as I understand there is no country in which a person 16 years of age or younger can work in a company, but there is also a law which dictates that a person not less than 16 years of age can work as long as they have the permission of their fathers
MysteriousK69 - GLCream By knowing @Willypro7 for a while now (an year or 2), I can quite confidently say that his father does not know about this.
MysteriousK69 - @Willypro7, what is taking so long to reply? Are you out with your non-existent friends or eating food?

MysteriousK69 - Znilla Its a bother to do that, but sure. I will use it.
Willypro7 - Bruh I already responded to everything u told ;-; @MysteriousK69
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 no? I don't see your reply.
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 You scammed another one of my ex customers about an hour ago. How would you go about justifying that?
MysteriousK69 - MysteriousK69 I don't know the exact amount, but I can gurantee that your broke ass will scam over a cent.
MysteriousK69 - @Willypro7 And, now you raid my server using the bot Lawliet Host. You are the only one who had the token except for me and my partner.
Willypro7 - MysteriousK69 Proof? maybe token got compromised
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 Look at this thread. And, no the token did not get compromised.
MysteriousK69 - Updated the post for those who are interested.
GLCream - MysteriousK69 Do you think that really matters or is it just to annoy because most of the hosts are run by kids? An example is Falixnodes.
MysteriousK69 - GLCream True, I guess it does not even matter anymore.
z_t0ht - Willy doesn't reply back to me anymore so why should I trust him he was a good friend back then but now something is wrong with him
PugRug - new invite?
MysteriousK69 - Mohamol334 

Mohamol334 1- I'll admit I'm not very good at English but I have a good enough level to communicate.

Your English is good enough to be in an international company. If you were Spanish only, your level is more than enough. Plus, you are really unprofessional.

Mohamol334 2- willy is lying, he is not 16 years old.
HE IS 12 YEARS OLD*.

We know. Everyone knows that Willy is 12.

Mohamol334 3- the terms and conditions are made with an online generator. It is this https://terminosycondicionesdeusoejemplo.com/

Yeah, one of the owners admitted to it.

Mohamol334 4- I was admin on MoonHost, once we got angry because he was talking bad to me behind my back and I couldn't stand the rage, so I raided the server.
(I have solved these problems of not holding back my anger)

Okay.

Mohamol334 I could prove that willy is 12 years old but he threatens me that he will call the police if I leak information about him.

Don't worry, no one will call the police, if he does I will deal with the legal mumbo jumbo, just prove that he is 12.
MysteriousK69 - Mohamol334 His father being a policeman will not affect the outcome.
MysteriousK69 - Mohamol334 If his father even arrests you, tell him about the illegal activities Willy is involved in.
Willypro7 - MysteriousK69 We know. Everyone knows that Willy is 12.

And then I created my discord account with 9 years? lol

MysteriousK69 If his father even arrests you, tell him about the illegal activities Willy is involved in.

MysteriousK69 - updated Discord link, and embedded images thanks to someone who reported it
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7
Wich ilegal activities lol

Account theft, aka token logging, scamming.

Willypro7 And then I created my discord account with 9 years? lol

Yeah, I guess? You should know that better.
MaiDub - MysteriousK69 Account theft, aka token logging, scamming.

Do not take it so seriously that, 2021 and stealing accounts is normal, cracking is the biggest thing that is happening and there are 8-year-old children taking out 300 Netflix accounts per day and see if the police are going to go to them
Deleted User - But its still 100% illegal
MaiDub - RiversideRocks Yes I know, illegal it will always be, anyway for me they should mature, it seems more envious for being both host
MysteriousK69 - MaiDub I am well aware of that, but its still illegal and always will be.
MysteriousK69 - MysteriousK69 Don't have proof of it, but Willy is involved in cracking too.
Vanquish - Mohamol334 powerful message
MysteriousK69 - Vanquish powerful, indeed.
Mohamol334 - Vanquish thx
Spoony - @Willypro7 Man quit responding you're just embarrassing yourself you're proving yourself more stupid than I thought you would be, for your knowledge, anyone under 18+, is underage unless you live in a brand new country/planet that's how that works, You can't spell illegal nor which just delete your server until you grow up, understand how to run a proper company/server. I feel ashamed calling it a company.

Spoony - Willypro7 If your referring to your account date of creation, discord Isn't 9 years old, if your referring to your age when you made your discord account, yes you can make it as a 9 year old faking your info online is possible, Unless you provide me proof of your age I will keep your age + mentality as a 12-year-old's if you add me on discord and prove to me your over 12, I will post it in this thread

I have tried to help him, but there's no point in it. He will just be toxic, won't listen, say "lol u lesvian gayoony xdddd" and block you, or never respond.
Spoony - MysteriousK69 Give it a few month's and he 'll prob end up shutting it down since you made the thread I am pretty sure no one uses his host.
MysteriousK69 - Spoony ok

Tomas - Willypro7 users / services ≠ actively used
Willypro7 - But they get used
Willypro7 - I want to resolve this thread

MysteriousK69 Their staff is unprofessional too, and clearly does not know what are they even doing. I even asked for the privacy policy &amp; but got banned (Which was, later given. Wrote about it in the post below).
  
That staff already got demoted. 

Also you where banned for begin irrespectful 

MysteriousK69 When I talked to a staff member, they were really unprofessional too, and gave me reasons like "Because you would harrass members", "ruin the host", "dox us", "ddos us", etc. While not being able to give proof to any of it, then accused me of trying to impersonate the CEO Willy.

You literally do that, I've got doxxed by you and you doxxed a lot of more people, that's why I don't trust you anymore. Ah, and also, remember that you got banned a lot of times from discord, for distribution cracked accounts, harassment, and other ilegal stuff, you even don't know how much times you did got banned

MysteriousK69 They are also using Vultr (prob free trials), and Contabo. (Don't get me wrong, nothing wrong with Contabo, but thought I would mention it to avoid misunderstanding)

We are not using the vultr one, was never related to us.

MysteriousK69 All words like "drama.gg", "fake", etc. Are banned to even say in their Discord server. That just shows how scummy they are.

It's the default thing banned by our moderation bot.

MysteriousK69 I reviewed their privacy policy, and its full of fake information. I am 100% sure its copy pasted from somewhere else. They say that they will tell the users what information is being collected and why, but it never is. In the next ss, it says that they will receive information such as email, name, etc. When we contact them, but that's not possible, because you can only contact them through Discord. They also claim to use Google adsense, but they clearly do not have it on their website. (https://moonhost.ga | https://moonhost.xyz)

You are right. We generated it with Termly now. It is valid now.

MysteriousK69 As I was writing this, Nai Aypro and toxic_recker (the people who helped me with this post) got banned.

Literally, you can join moonhost server and scroll in the chat, you will see that the reason is real.

MysteriousK69 Now, abusing Hetzner too? (I apologize for the bad screen shot, I just spammed the button to capture wht I could before he deleted.)

It's not abuse lol, we paid for the nodes, if no our nodes would be wiped in this time.

Also, not related to this post, you are acusing me to be 12 years old, you have no proof, just a friend of mine got angry for something personal and lied about my age, the message already got deleted when we got friends again, you have no more proof about it and you are acusing? 

Also @Jedrik idk why adding the confirmed tag if the only confirmed thing was invalid tos, that is fixed now

Can this tread get closed? - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-30/1622373239-998161-captura-de-pantalla-2021-05-30-a-las-131356.png
NotAypro - Willypro7 u wot m8, why are you putting commas literally after every 2 or 3 words, sorry if I look dumb but I cannot understand some stuffs from the message is saying :c
Willypro7 - NotAypro I used google translate bruh
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 

Willypro7 That staff already got demoted.

Great!

Willypro7 Also you where banned for begin irrespectful

Mate, you can't call that "disrespect". "Skid" is not even a bad word, its a word used to describe someone who skids something. Plus, you call YOURSELF a skid, and you have never minded me calling you a skid. So, why so suddenly? 

Willypro7 You literally do that, I've got doxxed by you and you doxxed a lot of more people, that's why I don't trust you anymore.

You said that the dox was incorrect. Also, how will I dox you by being in your server? Is this some new exploit in Discord, where you can somehow get everyone's information? Please don't be retarded. 

Willypro7 Ah, and also, remember that you got banned a lot of times from discord, for distribution cracked accounts, harassment, and other ilegal stuff, you even don't know how much times you did got banned

I have never done any of those things.

Willypro7 We are not using the vultr one, was never related to us.

You were literally a representative on Nexus, but ok

Willypro7 It's the default thing banned by our moderation bot.

ok

Willypro7 You are right. We generated it with Termly now. It is valid now.

Not going to bother checking, but ok

Willypro7 Literally, you can join moonhost server and scroll in the chat, you will see that the reason is real.

Mate, it is not a valid reason. They were toxic only in response to your staff being toxic. I think its fair for them to use a couple of swear words if the staff is also doing it, because literally anyone would think that its allowed.

Willypro7 It's not abuse lol, we paid for the nodes, if no our nodes would be wiped in this time.

You literally agreed to abusing, look at the ss.

Willypro7 Also, not related to this post, you are acusing me to be 12 years old, you have no proof, just a friend of mine got angry for something personal and lied about my age, the message already got deleted when we got friends again, you have no more proof about it and you are acusing?

If its not related, don't talk about it here.

Willypro7 Also @Jedrik idk why adding the confirmed tag if the only confirmed thing was invalid tos, that is fixed now

Do you is are have a mental illness?

Also, please go learn some actual fucking English, and don't just guess where to put commas.
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 Google Translate does not add random commas. You are just making fun of Google Translate at this point.
Willypro7 - MysteriousK69 You literally agreed to abusing, look at the ss.

I was joking, I said I mean no later in the ss lol
xgamer_tn - Is this fight going for 2 months ?? 0_0
You guys have some big patience
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 If it was just a joke, you wouldn't delete it just after, and say "fuck".
MysteriousK69 - xgamer_tn Willy just likes to randomly ignore the thread, probably because of depression due to his uncle repeatedly raping his ass
xgamer_tn - MysteriousK69 XD
Willypro7 - MysteriousK69 Mate, you can't call that "disrespect". "Skid" is not even a bad word, its a word used to describe someone who skids something. Plus, you call YOURSELF a skid, and you have never minded me calling you a skid. So, why so suddenly?

Well that's against our rules

MysteriousK69 You said that the dox was incorrect. Also, how will I dox you by being in your server? Is this some new exploit in Discord, where you can somehow get everyone's information? Please don't be retarded.

Anyway, no need to dox, only the phone number was incorrect. You can get information, as you got info about me indirectly

MysteriousK69 I have never done any of those things.

You did lol

MysteriousK69 You were literally a representative on Nexus, but ok

Moonhost is not Nexus, don't involve free trials here.

MysteriousK69 Not going to bother checking, but ok

The only valid reason for the thread is solved

MysteriousK69 Mate, it is not a valid reason. They were toxic only in response to your staff being toxic. I think its fair for them to use a couple of swear words if the staff is also doing it, because literally anyone would think that its allowed.

Toxic staffs get demoted, but there is no need to be toxic, and toxicity is not even the main reason, harassing users, ban evading and lying about provider is a thing too.

MysteriousK69 Do you is are have a mental illness?

No, you got?
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 

Willypro7 Well that's against our rules

I read your rules, and it said nothing about it.

Willypro7 Anyway, no need to dox, only the phone number was incorrect. You can get information, as you got info about me indirectly

ok

Willypro7 You did lol

No. Please, give me some proof &gt;_&lt;

Willypro7 Moonhost is not Nexus, don't involve free trials here.

ok

Willypro7 The only valid reason for the thread is solved

No.

Willypro7 Toxic staffs get demoted, but there is no need to be toxic, and toxicity is not even the main reason, harassing users, ban evading and lying about provider is a thing too.

Once again, we did not harass anyone, or ban evaded, or lied about our provider. Plus, even if we did, why tf would it matter for us to be in your server or not?

Willypro7 No, you got?

No, but its pretty obvious that you do. Pretty sure anyone who has read his thread of your other one can agree.
Mohamol334 - Willypro7  f bro has strong arguments
TigryPiggy - lmao I know willy and he is not 14 years old but 12.
MysteriousK69 - TigryPiggy lmfao
TigryPiggy - MysteriousK69 oh don't you believe me do I have to send you a photo? LOL
Willypro7 - Mohamol334 no tbh
TigryPiggy - TigryPiggy 
I'm kidding hahaha he's 14 but he has a mind of 12 xD
Willypro7 - MysteriousK69 I read your rules, and it said nothing about it.

false

MysteriousK69 No. Please, give me some proof &gt;_&lt;

you kicked me from the group lol

MysteriousK69 No.

yes, in this thread the reason was the tos.

MysteriousK69 Once again, we did not harass anyone, or ban evaded, or lied about our provider. Plus, even if we did, why tf would it matter for us to be in your server or not?

you did, and that's against of the rules that's why you cannot be on server

MysteriousK69 No, but its pretty obvious that you do. Pretty sure anyone who has read his thread of your other one can agree.

no
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 

Willypro7 false

Not false, I did read them and there was nothing about it there when I got banned.

Willypro7 you kicked me from the group lol

Is that literally all you have on me? We kicked you from the group that contained personal information, and now you are just trying to use it against us?

Willypro7 yes, in this thread the reason was the tos.

Read the thread, there are multiple reasons.

Willypro7 you did, and that's against of the rules that's why you cannot be on server

We did not. You are legit not giving any proof and go on bitching about us ban evading, harassing, or other shit, while ignoring any proof I give for any of your claims, then you just say "giV proOF".

Willypro7 no

One of your friends said that you are 14 but have the mind of a child (lmfaooooo), one said that you are 12. Also, just read the fucking thread you moron, anyone will agree to me.
Mohamol344 - oh ...
dxomgmyfriend - rip
mekb - if you look at their hidden channels (using bd or something) you can see how scuffed the server is
there's two channels called #closed-messageauthorid i see they accidentally put the channel name in quotes or something when writing some sort of ticket bot - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-12/1623480598-829945-image.png
babyharpseal - closedmessageauthorid is what it renames to when a ticket is closed.
