Well yeah they should look into better legal docs for sure
__SECRET__ - EmeraldMike then fo sure they are scaming
AllSafe - Hello EmeraldMike,

Seems like you are the one get in trouble, they have mentioned it's a giveaway therefore no financial remuneration is involved. Trying to threatening the host? It's a good reason they ban idiot from their server.

SirCat-Qlox - AllSafe listen im sorry, but this is drama.gg u dont have to be mr professional over here.
Sky - AllSafe REGARDLESS GIVEAWAY OR NOT.

Even attempting to resell any FiveM hosts is against their Service Agreement.
When a Giveaway happens, it's still HOSTED on their hosting equipment. Therefor it will still be counted as a "host".  They weren't a "idiot" in this situation, they saw something against their Service Agreement and proceeded to tell the staff, in a stern wording of course. And in the images itself, their staff clearly said: "sorry, i give vps servers for fivem hosting"

And LMAO you can stop with the "BeSt ReGaRdS" crap now.
AllSafe - Hello Sky,

Please provide evidence they attempt to resell FiveM host. However, the giveaway does not involve financial remuneration, self-hosting FiveM is legal and FiveM itself provide guide as well. https://docs.fivem.net/docs/server-manual/setting-up-a-server/

What TraterHost is doing is basically reselling FiveM services and making profit. Which is then against FiveM's Privacy Policy.

If you however BUY a single VPS, and install FiveM on that, that alone is different, and is considered a FiveM server. What you're saying is 2 things in 1 message. You can't just Resell them, and make profit. Then its considered stealing.

Sky Even attempting to resell any FiveM hosts is against their Service Agreement.

What I said was a fact, quoting from FiveM's Privacy Policy. Didn't even mean to include TraterHost in this, I think?

AllSafe Please provide evidence they attempt to resell FiveM host


I can easily provide evidence to this- as its clearly on their website. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-09/1639020994-338663-image.png
AllSafe - Hello Sky,

TraterHost clarify that the FiveM is provided in VPS, it's like pre-install FiveM into the VPS. The buyer can have root access of the VPS. How does that different from self-hosting? It's technically selling VPS with extra steps.

So how their hosting is working is basically the same exact thing like pterodactyl, a game panel.
Not a whole entire VPS- that'll either be dedicated hosting, or normal VPS hosting. Yes to basically bypass this rule, you could purchase a VPS through TraterHost, and then install FiveM so you aren't breaking the Privacy Policy for FiveM. 

The specs you see on the image above is what you get inside that game server.
AllSafe - Hello Sky,

Could you clarify that they are using game panel instead of VPS? Because they mentioned they are giving VPS in the chat transcription above.

Best Regards,
AllSafe
Sky - AllSafe Oh shit- I must've had a graphics error- I wasn't able to read the full convo- welp yeah its perfectly fine for them to use VPS hosting for FiveM.

Please disregard what I said.
Moderators, may close this thread as its not needed.
Entern - Dear Emerald,

I banned you because you cannot understand that we do not provide gamepanel and you threatened me that "you will have problems". 

We provide VPS Servers for fivem hosting. The customer have to install the server on the vps.
EmeraldMike - Entern  As yes so threatening. Also I never mentioned ANYTHING about how it is provided panel vps or otherwise. Also if you want to say your not breaking FiveM TOS you still have other things majory wrong.
EmeraldMike - Sky Spoiler alert ⚠️ 
Mods aren't going to close this.
EmeraldMike - Entern  If you refer to this image in the top of the post it has everything from the ticket.
Entern - EmeraldMike Tell me the other things.
EmeraldMike - Entern them "legal" policies
TheAlex - AllSafe 
thank god this motherfucker is banned
