babyharpseal - Hello there! So today I was searching through self-advertisement channels on Discord until I found this host called "FoxyNodes", I saw it as interesting, so I decided to join. I checked their main site, and it was a Freenom domain. ( https://foxynodes.ml )

I also checked their entire site, but never found something about ToS/Privacy Policy, and I knew they were operating for what I saw in their Discord server. 

When I created a ticket, some staff helped me, but he was a bit unprofessional. (Talking in Spanish in an English host, and more.)



I asked for their node IPs to check if they were abusing some type of hosting/using the free credit, but somehow, they seem to be using Hetzner dedicated servers, even though they don't seem to be able to afford a paid domain, and there are very cheap domains on sav.com or Namecheap.

Then, I proceeded to ask them where are their Privacy Policy and ToS after confirming their provider is Hetzner, and why they are operating without legal documents. Their staff said this:



Then, he sent me some Privacy Policy &amp; TOS preview, but it seems to be generated, and it's invalid.



I also asked them, if they are paying for 3 Hetzner dedicated servers, then, why don't they get a paid domain? Also, gotta be loving when they use a client ticket as a staff chat! ( lol )
