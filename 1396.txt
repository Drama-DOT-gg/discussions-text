FranXis - falixnodescool That website is from oxynodes, but the oxynodes website is very similar to mcworld website and if i remember, i think that was made by an app
falixnodescool - i dont have to say anything. just see. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-01-15/1642286905-811584-image.png
falixnodescool - Report this website to adsense. I already did that.
Ples - FranXis its made using mobirise
Ples - falixnodescool ive warned plexed and mike several times for this they dont seem to care, so why not report it im most likely gonna report it myself if they wont fucking listen
Shershah - Ples I also warned them not to post any kind of annoucements like this.
Ples - Shershah Yes they never listen i even know the ppl that reported them some of them are even one of my close friends, they dont seem to care so why not report them and show what happens when they dont give a fuck.
Ples - if someone else wants to report halex for literally breaking adsense policies here are some quick ss i got - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-01-16/1642293330-650622-image.png

Plexed - Ples We can no longer get suspended from adsense so mike doesn't care
Ples - Plexed you just sound fucking stupid doing that btw saying that wont rlly stop us from reporting it, this is against their policies after all
Plexed - falixnodescool For the email that's just hetz reporting ddos to the police lmao

Ples -  - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-01-16/1642293614-995978-image.png
Ples - Plexed what by making another adsense acc to do it or sum shit? listen plexed fucking halex or sum shit isnt fucking invinsible to fucking adsense, you are breaking their policies if u dont get punished by it why have it as a fucking policy

Shershah - Ples read again kthx
Ples - Shershah no what both of plexed and mike are doing , is just them warning/stressing their users to click ads, most ppl avoid ads its just common, and this type of stress put on kids htat hosts networks on free hosts will most likely make them spam the fuck out of the ads
Shershah - Yes alot of stress they put - https://i.imgur.com/Jw92llh.png
