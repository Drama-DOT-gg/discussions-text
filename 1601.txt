Halex - Uh so i just found this host called wavenodes bc phantom wanted help setting heliactyl up

They use oracle free trial nodes 
https://whatismyipaddress.com/hostname-ip
put in india1.wavenodes.tk lmfao

Seems like its also using .tk, phantom said they would get .xyz but never did so idk i dont like this host

I got myself an acc through phantom idk if its nulled midnight or not who knows - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-01-22/1642878686-102718-image.png
SirCat - i mean if they follow their trial in the right order their vpses will be free forever, tbh i dont see a big issue in free trials the only issue in them are datalosses, but if there is a trial which gives u a permanent free vps like oracle it should be fine tbh.
Aaron_ - Can someone invite me to their server? You can find me on the drama.gg server or just freind me on Aaron_#6969. Thanks in advance!
