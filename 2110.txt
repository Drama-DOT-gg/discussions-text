Hiii - And they lost the data of all clients. Did you use trials? - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-02-16/1676560448-329929-image.png
Sharky - I dont understand the point of this thread. Many host resell and sometimes a data corruption happens iirc plox doesnt use trials and with a markup like that its not a problem for them to renew. Seems like meaning less trash talk
ElSamuelcom - Sharky Yeah dude, Hiii is a dummy, and he have very free time.
Sydney - 1) WHO CARES? People resell other companies all the fucking time. Get over it
2) Data loss bad, backup shit

Overall, a shit post.

Well it's true that almost everyone resells, but what do you say about whmcs nulled? - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-02-23/1677162023-709821-image.png
Sydney - Hiii WHMCS is a shit software known to have a shitty license system. Not logging into the admin area/reissuing your license every month or so can cause that issue.
Hiii - Sydney Having whmcs cracked can be demandable. Or have your dedicated server suspended for copyright
Sydney - Hiii Proper english, please.
Timanttikuutio - Sharky "sometimes a data corruption happens"

no, no it does not, not to actual properly ran hosting companies at least, which this host clearly isn't.
TheAlex - noone cares. Most companies resell and that is fine. As long as no data corruption happens and they aren't using trials and what not i fail to see nay issue my man 
"Woah they upmark their prices" That's the whole point of reselling. What is your actual issue with them?
Jen - this is honestly the dumbest thread i have ever seen this year.
SoSad - Who honestly gives a shit if someone resells
LewisG - whats wrong with reselling?
