Deleted User - Yep same ol' ree
Deleted User - Alt accounts too
__SECRET__ - i see
ReeRee - Abusing azure isnt allowed.
You are going against your own words.
SRNodes doesnt have anything to do with me.
   
End of discussion.
Deleted User - ReeRee  nah not the end of discussion, you have 0 proof they abused and besides its a mc server they are using it to host their OWN mc server which is not againdt axure ToS in anyway
Catto - if we abuse them, they would be instantly know and suspend our server (they're microsoft, not a stupid scriptkid that barely knows networking)
Deleted User - And you still DDoSed which is ILLEGAL
Deleted User - Catto exactly thank you for stating that
ItsJaswant - I would like to add some more proofs about him nuking a youtuber's smp - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-01-21/1642763723-100875-image.png

ReeRee - Catto I know how they work, its pretty easy to abuse them id say.
Meong - ReeRee how exactly is that
Deleted User - ReeRee dam confessing to abusing i see
ReeRee - Zachery eh im a man of my words, im not biassed like you
Deleted User - ReeRee so be it if im biased you confessed to DDoSing a far greater crime then abusing
ReeRee - anyways i will no longger be replying to this thread as its pointless to me. Noone would be retarded enough to pay for Azure Subscriptions as its expensive as fuck. Tell them to change to something legit and they will no longger be in any problems.
Soyabn9 - ReeRee Fuck you cunt.
Deleted User - ReeRee extortion i see, and its not illegal in any way and you dont get to decide what host they use
ItsJaswant - "Exortion" - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-01-21/1642764344-835236-image.png
ReeRee - or well another way is to show me proof of payment that they pay for Azure services
Deleted User - They wont show you anything.
Soyabn9 - ReeRee Didn't you just say you weren't going to reply to this thread?
Deleted User - Do you really think i can stop your puny attack? Remember the other time when you ddosed me? I know all about the 3700+ infected computers which power your botnet
Qlox - Hold on let me get smthing clear, now of course some ppl will call me a fucking dipshit ik someone will.

But just cuz someone fail to show payment proof doesnt mean they are abusing, Some ppl do have a problem with showing payment proof, And you just gotta understand that.
Aaron_ - Catto if we abuse them, they would be instantly know and suspend our server (they're microsoft, not a stupid scriptkid that barely knows networking)

Unfortunately they are dumb, thousands of kids create new accounts to abuse them.
Qlox - Aaron_ yeah holy shit azure is so fucking ez to abuse, ppl just need to get a vcc and their good to go
Deleted User - can we focus on the part where hes actively ddosing?
Deleted User - which is a fucking federal crime?
SirCat - nah reehost is the best u defi cant find out its made by a 11 yr old just by looking at the name
Deleted User - SirCat exactly ðŸ¤£
A1ex - SirCat uh he is 15+
SirCat - A1ex dont defend the 11 yr old
CharityLexus - ReeRee Are you able to provide proof of this "abuse"
Deleted User - Are we not gonna talk about the fact that hes ddosing
