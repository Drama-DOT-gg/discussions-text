Scripted - Hey People,
1 week ago, Jaiden bought fusionhost (She took it forcefully but we decided to sell it instead of losing it)
But then today I see this, that jaiden charged us back. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-26/1629989585-79780-image.png
Scripted - If u want detailed explanation of what happened to fusionhost head over to
https://drama.gg/d/886-fusionhost-no-tos
Scripted - she also raided hosts in past
Grabstop - Additionally, she made a host called axolotl which in my opinion had a real good start with a .com domain and a .xyz domain 

We had ASIA and EU nodes however, I decided to quit the host and Jaiden went beserk and deleted the entire server and all the servers on the node.

Which also supports the fact that she is immature.
Jaiden - Scripted nice you leak my dads name
Jaiden - Scripted when and proof
Scripted - Hey, so first I want the answer, why did u charge back? I will censor ur dad's name for privacy, a second.
Scripted - m8 u do not answer to the real question and answer to the other questions.
Scripted - Also we can discuss this in dms @Jaiden , add me Scripted.#0001
Xmomoo - Jaiden luckynodes dont u remember?
Scripted - u can't just fucking chargeback from no where right?
Scripted - we did a agreement, u paid for it and u are not supposed to charge back.
Grabstop - Plus, Jaiden it was your choice to delete the server and thus means that you still need to pay Scripted and Xmomoo
Scripted - ye
Xmomoo - also, when i asked her about when she raided luckynodes she said that her bot was hacked and then when i asked her for the second time, she said that a friend leaked her token, i just wanna know, when luckynodes merged with her host, why did she invited the bot unless she did it on propose to raid the host? - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-26/1629992426-351118-img-20210826-173815.jpg
Scripted - she merges other hosts to her host
Scripted - and chargeback
Xmomoo - And thats when she was begging me to sell fusionhost - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-26/1629992787-908513-img-20210826-174552.jpg
