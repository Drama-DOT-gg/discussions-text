Jellz - Here we are drama lovers
i met this peculiar hosting by spam md which surprised me by the disaster that has management, as it is managed by children. 
the hosting is "" Spanish "" so I do not know well what they say, but i have translated some things to deduce everything i will say.

with the most basic, they use free trials of digital ocean. They dontt even know how to configure cloudflare...


then i saw that they have neither a home page, nor tos.


i am not an expert in spanish, but according to the translation, they are formatting the vps. pprobably because their month is over.... in addition to the fact that the message has spelling mistakes according to the translator, it would show that they are children who do not know how to speak.
ittt goes without adding, that they sell these free vps from digital, and also make invites for resources from their unstable dashactyl system.,,



iiit has channels in English and Spanish ? a laughable disaster.

nothing more to say, their ips have been reported and i leave the discord tags of these guys creators, ii have noted many more hosting spammers.
