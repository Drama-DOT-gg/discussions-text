Hye - Hello. There are few misconceptions I would like to address throughout this thread. 

Firstly, it seems to be widely believed N-VPS utilizes docker in order to achieve its non-virtualized state, I do truly understand why people would jump to that conclusion as Ararat is Pterodactyl-based, and utilizes Pterodactyl's frontend, however, the backend in Ararat (for N-VPS's, not Minecraft) is fully custom and does not utilize Docker in any way, shape, or form. In fact, KVM support is coming to Ararat soon.

Secondly, we do not have any official affiliation with badsk. In fact, this one's a funny story, before our Discord bot sent the welcome gifs, I would manually send them, and badsk wanted to see if I could send a ton of welcome gifs at the same time, so he tried to get a lot of people in at the same time to troll me ðŸ˜‚.

Thirdly, we do not use any of Heimsnet's software in any way, shape, or form. I'm not sure where you concluded that from but that statement is just inaccurate.

Finally, Hye Hosting does not run on older hardware which our system "makes run like on i9's". We use genuine Intel Core i9-9900K hardware.

Hope this clears up any misconceptions about our service,

KIVOX - Hye No one ever said you used docker containers, you and your staff just assume everyone means docker containers whenever the word "container" is mentioned.
KIVOX - KIVOX Correction: People did but no one did it after they were told it wasn't.
Hye - KIVOX Unfortunately I think you are mistaken. After us repeatedly coming out and stating N-VPS is not powered by docker, people continued to push, and still continue to push the false narrative which N-VPS utilizes docker.
KIVOX - Hye Can you name the people that have referred to them as "docker" containers. Because everyone in drama.gg and who I've talked to about the matter has called them containers.
Hye - KIVOX eraters, ash, and a couple of people who joined my discord randomly and left still believe to this day that it uses docker.
