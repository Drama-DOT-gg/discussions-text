candy - Good excuse Lellis.
NighMayHigh - Hi,

I apologise for all of this, RolledHost has been purchased by the System413 Group, we will be working with the two Founders to resolve these issues, both swiftly and effectively 

Kind Regards
NighMayHigh - Owner (413 Assets LTD t/a System413, Oddblox, RolledHost &amp; 413 Group)
Tomas - NighMayHigh Can you send your companies registration details
NighMayHigh - We will be working to make the business more transparent, and upfront about our offering.

We will also be moving nodes to servers owned by ourselves (Likely Ryzen 3900x), which will increase the uptime.

I will also personally be ensuring that the Founders are more professional, as honesty right now, the host is a complete and utter joke.
Tomas - NighMayHigh Can you send your companies registration details
