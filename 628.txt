Ryder - Not much to say but how on earth are these guys able to sell 200 cPanel accounts (reseller plans) for 2.5eur. It seemed sketch, with a little search on this I came to find out that their server has a solo license.

Sydney - Them: Give me smol amounts of money to run off with!
Tomas - The licence doesn't change if we pay per account, we pay the set fee (for the root account) and then per account on top of that monthly. (30c/ac)


Brixly does this too ^^

On another note, the licenses can't be edited or modified, they are encrypted and automatically generated by cPanel. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-15/1623786510-823023-image.png
Ryder - Could you please explain why the server has a solo license then?
Ryder - @Jedrik @Sloth üòÉ
Deleted User - Nade.Host also has a solo cpanel license or whatever its called
Ryder - Znilla its called editing license files to get more accounts than the license does.
Ryder - @Jedrik @Sloth at this point I feel like you are just avoiding the post. I recommend hiring more moderators and website admins if you are not able to do it.
Ryder - Tomas Thats false, you can modify the licensing file yourself to give yourself more accounts then allocated. Also if you pay 30 cents per account why dont you provide a invoice proof and moreover why did you hesitate in telling me the license provider or even the IP of the server? and any explanations for deleting all your messages from my pms? why did you have to do that if you paid 30 cents an account. It does not make any sense my man. 

For a situation lets agree that you purchase accounts at 0.30$ but you sell it at 0.01515$ an account which is 20 times less than the actual account cost. This is just not possible.
anonymous0 - Tomas this host "quack" is shit as well, another one of you motherfucking summer hosts, if somebody buys your $3 (2.50 euros) cpanel reseller which allows up to 2oo cpanel accounts, as you said you pay 30 cents per extra account, you would be paying at least $30 per month for those 200 accounts! (realistically, $60 per month when calculated, but I am being generous). it is not realistic nor possible that you can offer these solutions, and hey retard, theres something called editing cpanel licensing files, so if you pick up that 5 gram head of yours and admit "i fucked up" and dont null cpanel again, maybe i and others will have respect for you, you dirty fucking scammy retarded scumbag.
I have reported your website to the government of my country and your country, have reported it to all known hosting providers you used, and filed some piracy reports. Good luck, you'll be shitting your pants when your buyers lose access!
LordDioski - anonymous0 Wait a minute, who are you?
anonymous0 - LordDioski who are you?
Two - lorddioski asked the question first so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
imagine trying to hide yourself behind an alt account

anyways, from what i see, there's no real proof that they are cracking whm/cpanel accounts, and they could possibly lose a ton of money if someone abuses the whm, but i could be wrong
Ryder - @Two why would someone have to spend their time to delete private messages to me? I don't see a reason to unless they are trying to hide something. Its obvious to me whats happening here. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-18/1623984751-504169-image.png
