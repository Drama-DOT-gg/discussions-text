Thominek - Oh yeah this kid lmao
Ples - this kid claimed he was going to make a better host than kittennodes LOL
Thominek - lol hes using freenom
Aplimmm - The creator of the host only want to make host without budget and prob they just use sourcecode for the dashboard
Aplimmm - lest see about that - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-11-30/1638246441-642308-image.png
Chills - STFU CHILLNODES IS A TRUSTWORTHY HOST AND IAM USING FREENOM DOMAIN ONLY FOR TEMPORARY WE ARE GONNA SWITCH TO .XYZ SOON SO SHUT UR MOUTH AND I HATE YOU ARONIKTV TO RUIN MY LIFE 2ND TIME
Preon - @Chills we all saw right through that lie. You are 100% using a freenom domain because you can’t afford one, and .xyz is like 50¢ anyway.
Chills - Preon no
i can afford it
its temporary
Preon - My advice is to come back to this idea when you have money to pay for someone to make a TOS, Privacy Policy, etc, and have at least 3% more knowledge in Linux to deploy a Pterodactyl Panel and Wings correctly. Otherwise people will just continue to expose you.
Preon - @Chills You don't understand. .XYZ is the cheapest TLD and only further proves my point that you are absolutely in no fit position to be opening a hosting. Leave it to someone who actually knows what they’re doing.
FlexFancyspy - Chill nodes is legit we just need time dont make drama or we will close our free service only paid
Aplimmm - mental breakdown??? - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-11-30/1638248412-138750-image.png
Preon - Preon Not even opened yet and already begging your community for money. Typical. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-11-30/1638248402-716638-5f2a0027-01a8-44fa-8fd4-beefc45932e7.jpg
Chills - Preon now chillnodes is a paid host
Soul - FlexFancyspy very legit no scam 2021
Preon - Chills poor guy can’t financially support himself. I expected it.
Chills - Preon stfu
Preon - Chills This community exists to expose people like you trying to turn a profit from having absolutely nothing. If that displeasures you, kindly gtfo
Chills - now i will ruin drama.gg
they ruined my carrier
Soul - Chills yes drama.gg very bad!1!!111!!11!1!1! /j
Preon - Chills This 'career' of yours didn’t exist to begin with. Good luck abusing AWS, Hetzner, Azure free trials to make your unprofessional environment seem tolerable.
Valbott - what does this drama goes for?
PrakritKumar - Preon We never even abused
Chills - PrakritKumar and never gonna abouse
Aplimmm - i remember that chills asking other people that have money to run a host with him and he not even have a vps so the one guy just giving the node and doing all by him self lmfao
Preon - PrakritKumar Not yet, but it’s always a constant that people who appear on drama.gg for these exact reasons eventually get gradually worse and worse until they fake a dataloss and shut down. Badsk, anyone?
Aplimmm - Preon  well ya this happen alot on all hosting company i ever seen
Preon - PrakritKumar If that's the case, show us your DigitalOcean VPS invoice and that will hereby clear you from any wrongdoing.
PrakritKumar - Agh We never even started
Why u all want invoice
Preon - PrakritKumar because we basically already know the invoice doesn’t exist and you are abusing trials, nice to ask for them anyway to get the children butthurt
PrakritKumar - We never even started the trials
PrakritKumar - what are you even talking about
Preon - PrakritKumar What do you have for servers then? Seems highly unlikely that a community of this variety would have the physical mental capacity to order them the normal way.
Enderman - stfu its legit
Preon - Enderman Hello Chill, nice alt you've got here. Is it as money hungry as your main account?
Preon - Preon @Enderman @Chills DDoSsing will only make your reputation go down and this community will clown you even more. You could've just backed out. - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-11-30/1638250600-392897-be4ff871-8d85-446b-ad5c-9ac2b2785ddb.jpg

FlyingMane - Their owner's DMs are closed, which honestly pisses me off, like of you are gonna have a host keep your DMS open... - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-11-30/1638254920-767293-screenshot-2021-11-30-06-45-07-721-comdiscord.jpg

PrakritKumar - By u all
PrakritKumar - I am not doing anything to you, then why are you creeping me out
FlyingMane - PrakritKumar you banned me. You were offering a shit service and you think that you becoming paid is gonna change anything. Skid
Ples - rhys im not plexed but aight
AronikTV - FlyingMane i got banned too lmao
FlyingMane - AronikTV I am generally ok with resellers but this a next level of cancer
AronikTV - FlyingMane This is the best example for a kid hosting
PrakritKumar - FlyingMane No, we were trying to make a good host start. I know that it takes money to start a host, but then you all started saying that I am 10 even though I am not I am 15-16 yrs old
PrakritKumar - AronikTV FlyingMane But i didnt banned you'll
AronikTV - PrakritKumar Still a kid you cant pay bills after 1 month
PrakritKumar - AronikTV I am not a KID i am a TEEN
PrakritKumar - AronikTV I could pay, if i get some ad revenue.
__SECRET__ - Chills what u mean hell?
raid the discord server or just make 1000+ alt account to support you or just bring up ur entire staff team to help you?
SnailDOS - PrakritKumar you fukin act like a 10 year old
FlyingMane - PrakritKumar server is yours, what your staff do is under your responsibility
PrakritKumar - SnailDOS But i am not
SnailDOS - PrakritKumar ok
FlyingMane - PrakritKumar don't know, don't care. Your job is to work on your hosting, and get the money however you like. You claimed you had your computer? You didn't know it's fucking specs. 
Not to mention that you said yourself you used to give away free trial nodes
PrakritKumar - I could also say you'll are 5 yrs old but you aren't
SnailDOS - PrakritKumar No, I don't act like one xD
PrakritKumar - FlyingMane Who said
Any proof
AronikTV - PrakritKumar Lmao you are such a kid
__SECRET__ - wtf they deleted the discord or the link is invalid I wanna have a look at their  " HoStInG SeRvEr"
PrakritKumar - __SECRET__ you forced us
AronikTV - __SECRET__ hahaha
__SECRET__ - PrakritKumar  when the fuck did I forced I joined drama.gg like 2 PM IST
PrakritKumar - __SECRET__ I mean You all
FlyingMane - PrakritKumar your fucking a nnouncements channel where you showed pictures of a computer claiming it was your server
__SECRET__ - PrakritKumar dude u guys didn't even start ur host  and acting like u own a VERY BIG HOSTING and when we ask for proof u  all act like little 9 years old
__SECRET__ - that is why everyone is saying u 5 year old
PrakritKumar - FlyingMane Yes it was my computer and wanted to make a server but I was lacking port forwarding.
My isp is expensive, which means high port forwarding charges
PrakritKumar - __SECRET__ We NEVER declared Chillnodes as a very big host
__SECRET__ - PrakritKumar but u all were acting like that
PrakritKumar - __SECRET__ NEVER
__SECRET__ - PrakritKumar ur wish i just gave my opinon
FlyingMane - PrakritKumar You claimed that that was sour server, own up to it. And you deleting your host entirely was a way to prove how shitty your host was, it had no basis, nothing to stand upon
PrakritKumar - FlyingMane I know it was a shit host but we tried to get it good
__SECRET__ - PrakritKumar now any other plans for new host?
PrakritKumar - __SECRET__ No Never
PrakritKumar - __SECRET__ If chills want then he could i will not be doing anything
__SECRET__ - lol
but really opening a free host looks like to me as just giving yourself a daily dose of tension stress and random 12 year old's  rage every single day with a shit ton of discord pings
PrakritKumar - __SECRET__ Yeah

Thominek - people who say Qlox abuses nodes they dont know that he changed
