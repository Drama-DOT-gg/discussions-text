dxqt - discord? client and panel links? node ip?
PolyAnthi - Discord is on https://spiralnodes.xyz
Client panel: https://client.spiralnodes.xyz
Panel is: https://panel.spiralnodes.xyz
Node IP: 157.55.211.193
NoHaxito - Oh, you again.
If having afk page was illegal, why not say the same to the owners of CentroNodes? Why don't you say the same to the owners of other free hosts that have afk page as AlacticHost (+1500 members) SkisHost (+1400 members) ?
The so-called free trials. We acquired that node with an external provider, if he uses Azure it is not our problem.
PolyAnthi - 1: I have already reported those hosts for using arc on an afk page.
2: LMAO. Sure sure. Send the link to the external provider and we'll see if thats the truth.
Aaron_ - NoHaxito Number 2, You should be aware of who you are buying from. And why buy from external providers when you can buy a good vps from trusted hosts
HiroBeet - Hi there,

We are a small free hosting company located in Uk (United Kingdom) and today several people from EpikHost, counting the same Owner of said company. He came telling us that it broke the TOS of the peer-to-peer service, ARC.io, to which we answered no, also here is the explanation, the dash after a time of being inactive is automatically removed from the AFK page. Also, I think that the EpikHost service has something against us, since I have not seen them approach larger services like CentralNodes (Very good service), saying the same thing. If the protection of the AFK page is not enough, we are working on a game for the same page so that it stops being completely AFK.

Regarding our so-called 'free trial', we have paid for the Ares node to an external provider (35 dollars a month) that he does completely use said service (Azure) and that I do not think it is free trial. We do NOT use free trial, and we have another node on the way, but it is not from the external provider if that is the problem.

I do not know why the owners of EpikHost resent us so much if we have not done anything to any community in general, we are simply a small hosting company like any other.

The person who uploaded this post without arguments, came to our discord server breaking 3 main rules of our discord channel, and although we told him to contact us by e-mail (support@spiralnodes.xyz) he did not do so since I guess I wanted to do this post. Which I honestly do not understand why.

Please, people of EpikHost, I simply ask that you respect us as a company and that you stop treating us as less simply because we are smaller, I put the example again of CentralNodes, I invite you to make a complete report of CentralNodes. (We have nothing against anyone, including mentioned services)

Hiro, SpiralNodes.
PolyAnthi - Aaron_ And this. The provider most likely uses free trials. Make a big profit from that.
This would cause massive data losses when the VPS is terminated and the host would have a horrible reputation.
HiroBeet - HiroBeet Sorry I mentioned Â´CentralNodesÂ´ and is Â´CentroNodesÂ´ actually. My bad.
Aaron_ - PolyAnthi I don't understand what's wrong with using arc. They state that it has to be SFW (which their sites are already is). They also have organic traffic. Its not just a website that you use to earn coins like something.host - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-10-20/1634751562-425614-image.png
PolyAnthi - HiroBeet I can say that inactive time is not "automatically removed" as our host uses arc ourselves. We do not have anything against you and I have actually already reported bigger hostings.

I would not trust your provider as it clearly is a free trial.

We don't resent you but harassing one of our main management team isn't cool.

I would go by email but that would lead into me barely getting responses. I also did not break 3 main rules. You actually broke about 3+ rules.

I do not respect you as a company purely because you use: Free Trials, AFK Arc Page and other stuff.
PolyAnthi - Aaron_ the /afk page is. That is against TOS.
HiroBeet - Aaron_ That is what I would also like to understand, I don't know why they hate SpiralNodes so much being such a small company.
PolyAnthi - Can be found: https://client.spiralnodes.xyz/afk
HiroBeet - PolyAnthi I will not repeat the same thing again. Like I said, if you don't believe us in two weeks or less we will be putting up a new node for a real company. I still don't understand why I hate so much. Why don't you report to CentroNodes? I am inviting you to what you are doing. Another thing, could you know what rules I broke? I am very sure that you were the boy who entered our server. You also have no arguments or evidence to call us liars. Or could I know? Please.
Aaron_ - PolyAnthi Does arc.io even care? no. I have seen people earning and collecting the money.
PolyAnthi - HiroBeet I already have reported CentroNodes and other big hosts and other smaller hosts.
Aaron_ - PolyAnthi Any replies yet?
PolyAnthi - Aaron_ It's clearly against their TOS.
PolyAnthi - Aaron_ Yep. They've taken down 2/5 reported.
HiroBeet - PolyAnthi Now out of nowhere did you report CentroNodes? Interesting, what would happen if I send them an e-mail or contact them?
PolyAnthi - HiroBeet Yep. I normally just report hosts that I see using arc.io on an afk page. This is the exact reason why I don't like talking to server owners but because you are a smaller community, I thought you'd actually listen. Proved me wrong I guess!
Aaron_ - PolyAnthi They state "not just a page to afk on" and their site is NOT just a page to afk on. They have a few buttons which are useful for members.
PolyAnthi - Aaron_ "a few buttons" - most are related to the coins feature (afking). Shop, creating a server (can be related to coins) etc.
HiroBeet - PolyAnthi Can you just read what I wrote? Even if that the problem, we will be adding a game or something else.

I would not like them to continue staining the name of SpiralNodes without bases or arguments when they already explain the situation to us. I ask you for the last time to stop trying to taint our name as a company. Without saying anything else, I'm leaving.

Hiro, SpiralNodes.
Kowone - most of the times, arc.io doesn't give a shit about hosts using it on afk page
Aaron_ - PolyAnthi If I'm not wrong arc.io reviews them themselves and most of the people I know get approved because they don't just have an afk page.
Aaron_ - Kowone Exactly.
Aaron_ - PolyAnthi There is still the traffic and other features and not just an afk page.
PolyAnthi - Aaron_ Okay. I'll email arc and see how long it takes. Enjoy your day.
Aaron_ - PolyAnthi Alright, Have a great rest of your day. ðŸ‘‹
Aaron_ - Also when did you email arc.io about the big hosts? Did they get back to you?
PolyAnthi - Aaron_ As mentioned above, 2/5 responded to me. I sent them at different days tho (probably about 1/2 days apart from each one). Waiting on the next few responses.

Sent them about 3/4 weeks ago.
Aaron_ - Okay, what did they say about it? (arc.io)
PolyAnthi - Aaron_ I've only received the responses about 4/5 days ago but they said they would look into it and they said the evidence I provided (screenshots of the client panel) looks fairly legit but they just need to double check and figure out which account is using it on that site etc.
HiroBeet - PolyAnthi I just contacted CentroNodes, I asked them if anyone has reported to CentroNodes in the last 6 months on arc, and they replied that they haven't heard anything about it. Interesting.
PolyAnthi - HiroBeet Read the posts I've been sending. 2/5 replied. Read man read.
HiroBeet - PolyAnthi Interesting as well. Could you send a snapshot of the report email with its date?
Aaron_ - PolyAnthi Alright. Curious to see where they end up.
HiroBeet - PolyAnthi I just contacted one of the directors of CentroNodes directly, and he said no.
Aaron_ - HiroBeet I honestly doubt arc.io will take any action.
PolyAnthi - Sorry. Was grabbing a drink. Heres the screenshot - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-10-20/1634753020-44502-image.png
HiroBeet - PolyAnthi Why you don't show the whole mail? Also, I'm sure that they don't use 'The Arc.io Team' as a signature, they normally use things like 'Yours,
Ansgar, Eric, Ben, and Diego' | Also why you don't show that's it's for CentroNodes?
Aaron_ - PolyAnthi Wouldn't that be 6 days ago?
PolyAnthi - Aaron_ Its the 20th today?
PolyAnthi - HiroBeet No idea? That is the whole mail?
HiroBeet - PolyAnthi Interesting.
PolyAnthi - I'm going to do IRL stuff now. Peace.
Aaron_ - Why don't you send us screen recordings of what you sent and what they sent and keep refreshing the site multiple times to make it not look like its inspect elemented. I think that's the best way to do it or atleast that's how I would do it.
HiroBeet - Aaron_ @PolyAnthi I really love the idea.
Chirag - Aaron_ arc.io doesn't give a shit about afk pages, at most, you just won't get accepted for a payout
Chirag - NoHaxito The so-called free trials. We acquired that node with an external provider, if he uses Azure it is not our problem.

proof?
dxqt - PolyAnthi
 
From what i see, if they only having afk page and nothing else
then yes it's against their tos
but i have a lot of active users, and our dashboard are more complicated than normal dashactyl with afk page
so what's the problem here? - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-10-21/1634791877-115455-image.png
6969 - dxqt Just like what i saw lel also oi dxqt (Sharky)
Aaron_ - Aaron_ @PolyAnthi I really like my own idea. Can you do it?
Aaron_ - Guess they won't be replying back anymore ðŸ¤·
Aaron_ - Talked with one of the staffs last week and it seems like they have stopped using the VPS from azure because their provider scammed them. I don't know if they are telling the truth. I still have my doubts.
Aaron_ - Would like an update @PolyAnthi
IamKarmaBitch - huh
Razes - IamKarmaBitch u there in discord
Aaron_ - Seriously dude? tf
Aaron_ - Happy new year, Any replies from Arc.io yet good sir?
Parzial - Any replies from Arc.io yet?
Jen - NoHaxito Hello, If possible can you send me an invite to your discord . I am a known person in the drama.gg community and I am willing to propose real money in buying out your host. Please respond to me as soon as possible
luffyy - Whose Jen o.o
