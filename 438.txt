MysteriousK69 - Hello, everyone.

Today, I am here with another another post about Willypro7 aka Mr P Willy or William Mara, who used to be a really good friend of mine, I used to trust that kid.

So, as I am writing this post my server just got raided and I suffered losses of about 100 members, including customers, free customers, and regular members. Why is it related to this post you might ask? Well, that's because its awfully obvious that Willy was the person who did it.

I am not going to point fingers without any reason, so let me explain myself. So, Willy can be seen using "bed" instead of "bad" almost all the time. And, the reason why all of my members were banned was "bed af server". Proof is in the screen shots below


If that was not enough, the bot that was used Lawliet Host (our official bot) banned everyone. Guess what? The only 2 people I trusted enough to give the token to were Aypro and Willy. Aypro is still trusted by me and he has no reason to raid as we are in this business together and both are making profits. Plus, he is not dumb enough to only raid the server. If Aypro wanted to ruin the company, he has the access to panel, Discord, all the VPS's, the PayPal, and pretty much everything as an admin. So, that just leaves out Willy as the only suspect for the raid. So, I think we can conclude that Willy raided Lawliet.Host's server.

Oh, and if that proof was not good enough, he holds grudges against me for making drama.gg threads against him, and not trusting him after he scammed me and did more scummy things.

That is not even the start of all the things Willy has done yet. So, upnext we have him scamming me ~$16 ($10+3+3+ a few cents that I forgot bout) (what a broke ass) and a 16 gig RAM VPS. You did give me a VPS but it was MY VPS. Proof can be found in the screen shots below.



. 
Then, just scamming me was not enough, so he also scammed my customers. Proof can be found below.


Oh, and if I forgot to mention it before, he has owned quite a few shitty hosting companies in the past, and owns one right now named MoonHost. Some of his old ones are NexusNodes &amp; HoneyHost. All of them had terrible services and were mostly working off of free trials. Nexus &amp; Moon both have threads on them. Just search for it, I am too lazy to find it right now.

Update for those who don't want to read the entire thread: So, I recently dug up some proof of Willy being involved with activities like token logging.
 



And, his company MoonHost operates without a board of directors or a chairman. Not completely sure if this is legal or not though.

There's a ton more on MoonHost, but I will leave this thread away from that, check the MoonHost thread here.


Now, abusing Hetzner too? (I apologize for the bad screen shot, I just spammed the button to capture wht I could before he deleted.)


Asking for cracked WHMCS. It may look like he is trolling, but he really isn't.


Asking how to add swap and not knowing basic Linux,





My apologies if I mentioned this before, but he also says to my customers that I am a scammer for no apparent reason, and without proof. Mr Heroine is still hosting with us, and is happy with the services he gets.



I am sorry if I forgot to mention something, but the amount of scummy things he has done just can not be remembered by me. If I did forget something, please let me know in the replies.

I would like to end this post by saying this. You truly are the lowest scum in history, Willy.

Asking for cracked WHMCS. It may look like he is trolling, but he really isn't.


Asking how to add swap and not knowing basic Linux,





My apologies if I mentioned this before, but he also says to my customers that I am a scammer for no apparent reason, and without proof. Mr Heroine is still hosting with us, and is happy with the services he gets.



I am sorry if I forgot to mention something, but the amount of scummy things he has done just can not be remembered by me. If I did forget something, please let me know in the replies.

I would like to end this post by saying this. You truly are the lowest scum in history, Willy.

MysteriousK69 - Hello, everyone.

Today, I am here with another another post about Willypro7 aka Mr P Willy or William Mara, who used to be a really good friend of mine, I used to trust that kid.

So, as I am writing this post my server just got raided and I suffered losses of about 100 members, including customers, free customers, and regular members. Why is it related to this post you might ask? Well, that's because its awfully obvious that Willy was the person who did it.

I am not going to point fingers without any reason, so let me explain myself. So, Willy can be seen using "bed" instead of "bad" almost all the time. And, the reason why all of my members were banned was "bed af server". Proof is in the screen shots below


If that was not enough, the bot that was used Lawliet Host (our official bot) banned everyone. Guess what? The only 2 people I trusted enough to give the token to were Aypro and Willy. Aypro is still trusted by me and he has no reason to raid as we are in this business together and both are making profits. Plus, he is not dumb enough to only raid the server. If Aypro wanted to ruin the company, he has the access to panel, Discord, all the VPS's, the PayPal, and pretty much everything as an admin. So, that just leaves out Willy as the only suspect for the raid. So, I think we can conclude that Willy raided Lawliet.Host's server.

Oh, and if that proof was not good enough, he holds grudges against me for making drama.gg threads against him, and not trusting him after he scammed me and did more scummy things.

That is not even the start of all the things Willy has done yet. So, upnext we have him scamming me ~$16 ($10+3+3+ a few cents that I forgot bout) (what a broke ass) and a 16 gig RAM VPS. You did give me a VPS but it was MY VPS. Proof can be found in the screen shots below.



. 
Then, just scamming me was not enough, so he also scammed my customers. Proof can be found below.


Oh, and if I forgot to mention it before, he has owned quite a few shitty hosting companies in the past, and owns one right now named MoonHost. Some of his old ones are NexusNodes &amp; HoneyHost. All of them had terrible services and were mostly working off of free trials. Nexus &amp; Moon both have threads on them. Just search for it, I am too lazy to find it right now.

Update for those who don't want to read the entire thread: So, I recently dug up some proof of Willy being involved with activities like token logging.
 



And, his company MoonHost operates without a board of directors or a chairman. Not completely sure if this is legal or not though.

Then, just scamming me was not enough, so he also scammed my customers. Proof can be found below.


Oh, and if I forgot to mention it before, he has owned quite a few shitty hosting companies in the past, and owns one right now named MoonHost. Some of his old ones are NexusNodes &amp; HoneyHost. All of them had terrible services and were mostly working off of free trials. Nexus &amp; Moon both have threads on them. Just search for it, I am too lazy to find it right now.

Update for those who don't want to read the entire thread: So, I recently dug up some proof of Willy being involved with activities like token logging.
 



And, his company MoonHost operates without a board of directors or a chairman. Not completely sure if this is legal or not though.

There's a ton more on MoonHost, but I will leave this thread away from that, check the MoonHost thread here.


Now, abusing Hetzner too? (I apologize for the bad screen shot, I just spammed the button to capture wht I could before he deleted.)


Asking for cracked WHMCS. It may look like he is trolling, but he really isn't.


Asking how to add swap and not knowing basic Linux,





My apologies if I mentioned this before, but he also says to my customers that I am a scammer for no apparent reason, and without proof. Mr Heroine is still hosting with us, and is happy with the services he gets.



I am sorry if I forgot to mention something, but the amount of scummy things he has done just can not be remembered by me. If I did forget something, please let me know in the replies.

I would like to end this post by saying this. You truly are the lowest scum in history, Willy.

MysteriousK69 - Hello, everyone.

Today, I am here with another another post about Willypro7 aka Mr P Willy or William Mara, who used to be a really good friend of mine, I used to trust that kid.

So, as I am writing this post my server just got raided and I suffered losses of about 100 members, including customers, free customers, and regular members. Why is it related to this post you might ask? Well, that's because its awfully obvious that Willy was the person who did it.

I am not going to point fingers without any reason, so let me explain myself. So, Willy can be seen using "bed" instead of "bad" almost all the time. And, the reason why all of my members were banned was "bed af server". Proof is in the screen shots below


If that was not enough, the bot that was used Lawliet Host (our official bot) banned everyone. Guess what? The only 2 people I trusted enough to give the token to were Aypro and Willy. Aypro is still trusted by me and he has no reason to raid as we are in this business together and both are making profits. Plus, he is not dumb enough to only raid the server. If Aypro wanted to ruin the company, he has the access to panel, Discord, all the VPS's, the PayPal, and pretty much everything as an admin. So, that just leaves out Willy as the only suspect for the raid. So, I think we can conclude that Willy raided Lawliet.Host's server.

Oh, and if that proof was not good enough, he holds grudges against me for making drama.gg threads against him, and not trusting him after he scammed me and did more scummy things.

Again proof I sent the theme and was not a scam, and my host doesn't run in free trials lol.

just because I like to use bed, you need to say that I am the raider? - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-01/1619869629-849390-captura-de-pantalla-2021-05-01-a-las-134707.png

when I left Lawliet.host almost sure that u rested token or something, and why would need to raid?

Any proof of we using free trials?
Willypro7 - I need proofs of the raiding, prove it, kid
NighMayHigh - Willypro7 

you are clearly not above the age of 13, don't call other people ''kid ' when you are one yourself
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 

Willypro7 Heyyo again, first, I am 16 years old once again I am telling that.

Alright. Though, your irl friend said that you are 12.

Willypro7 Then, I was not admin in the server, and I am even banned. How tf u want me to raid?

Mate, please read the post completely.

Willypro7 Again proof I sent the theme and was not a scam

Proof of you helping him fix it?

Willypro7 and my host doesn't run in free trials lol.

Alright. Though, its hard to believe a kid who is scamming for a few dollars will buy a VPS. And, I think someone did prove that you were using free credits of Vultr in NexusNodes thread.
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 I did not reset the token. And, you would need it to raid, because you used the bot to raid it.
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 Read the NexusNodes thread.
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 Sure. - https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/837985250561884191/838022269317808128/Screenshot_295.png
MysteriousK69 - NighMayHigh Exactly. If you talked to him even for a little while, it becomes really obvious.
MysteriousK69 - @Willypro7 Also, check the other thread about your shitty hosting MoonHost if you did not give up on defending yourself.
Willypro7 - NighMayHigh Do you have a reason about that? I am 16 years old, once again.
Willypro7 - MysteriousK69 Alright. Though, your irl friend said that you are 12.

He is not my friend, and he was just angry with me in that moment.

MysteriousK69 Proof of you helping him fix it?



Worked for him after the trick

MysteriousK69 Alright. Though, its hard to believe a kid who is scamming for a few dollars will buy a VPS. And, I think someone did prove that you were using free credits of Vultr in NexusNodes thread.

Nexusnodes it's nexus nodes and moonhost is moonhost - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-01/1619872510-763591-captura-de-pantalla-2021-05-01-a-las-143507.png

Willypro7 - Bxrk what wrong lol
Toki0179 - Willypro7 Here, why don't we turn this around. Can you prove that you aren't using free trials?
Willypro7 - Toki0179 Sure

as far I know contabo has no free trials - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-01/1619901513-685075-captura-de-pantalla-2021-05-01-a-las-223807.png
DeletedUser19wxkn89s - Yeah he also tried to sell me the Midnight Dashactyl Theme. Thats reselling a theme.
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 

Willypro7 He is not my friend, and he was just angry with me in that moment.

He is your friend, and you literally said that you were in his account. And, you also know him irl.

Willypro7 Worked for him after the trick

What trick? He never said that it works.

Willypro7 Nexusnodes it's nexus nodes and moonhost is moonhost

Okay? You still own both of them.
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 And, what about your Vultr VPS?
MysteriousK69 - DeletedUser19wxkn89s He sells a lot of shit after skidding it from Nulled or BlackSpigot
Willypro7 - DeletedUser19wxkn89s whattt? Send proof lmaoo
Willypro7 - MysteriousK69 i have no any vulr vps
Willypro7 - MysteriousK69 He is your friend, and you literally said that you were in his account. And, you also know him irl.

No longer thats why he wanted to kill my rep
Willypro7 - MysteriousK69 What trick? He never said that it works.

But works
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 It was proved in the NexusNodes thread that you guys are using Vultr.
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 Pretty sure no one cares about killing your non existent rep.
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 He said that he got scmmed to me in DMs, and he never confirmed that it works in your screenies. I can't just take a scammers word for it. Also, justify you scamming me, and raiding my server.
Willypro7 - MysteriousK69 Willypro7 It was proved in the NexusNodes thread that you guys are using Vultr.

I am fucking not nexusnodes i am moonhost, why do you dont understand that?
Willypro7 - MysteriousK69 I have rep lol
Willypro7 - MysteriousK69 He said that he got scmmed to me in DMs, and he never confirmed that it works in your screenies.

He dmed u before i send the theme. And it was working, just he didn't reply, it's obvious will work
Willypro7 - MysteriousK69 Also, justify you scamming me, and raiding my server.

I want fucking proofs of me raiding. You didn't gave any proof of me having token, or any proof literally of me raiding
FatGrizzly - Willypro7 are you 9 y old? Your English sounds like 9 y old lmao
RusJS - Willypro7 are you just retarded or are you 7 years old.. you keep adding random commas and trying to be professional when you actually aren't xD. Your English is terrible
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 You were in Nexus, pretty sure about it.
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 Scammers don't get to say that.
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 Are you fucking retarded?
MysteriousK69 - RusJS I know right, the skid has no concept of grammar.
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 Eh? I think the proof I gave was good enough. And, what about you scamming me? Are you still just going to be ignoring it?
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 I apologize if it was too much for your brain to comprehend, but he never said it works. Not to me, not to you in DMs.
Willypro7 - FatGrizzly I am spanish sadly
Willypro7 - RusJS English it's not my main language
Willypro7 - MysteriousK69 Eh? I think the proof I gave was good enough. And, what about you scamming me? Are you still just going to be ignoring it?

You didn't gave any proof about me raiding
Willypro7 - MysteriousK69 
he even asked me for other themes, so of course worked for him - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-02/1619951757-16569-captura-de-pantalla-2021-05-02-a-las-123553.png
Willypro7 - MysteriousK69 I am not scammer
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 Jokes on you, English is my 3rd language.
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 Pretty sure I gave enough proof.
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 Makes sense, but he still did not confirm it.
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 You are. After you ignore me whenever I ask for money my money, or VPS, you just ignore me. When I ask you to prove that you did not scam me, you ignore me.
Willypro7 - MysteriousK69 Pretty sure I gave enough proof.

Still, just because I like to use "bed" instead of "bad", you need to acuse me for the raid? You have no proof of me having the token tbh
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 The thing is, you are not going to find anyone else who can do that. And, I do not have proof of the token since the server got raided. Also, check the other messages smh. Though, you did have the token as you asked for it when you installed Dashactyl.
Willypro7 - MysteriousK69 But I lost access to the vps, how do I keep the token then? (No, I didn't saved it.)
You have no more proof?
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 You lost access to the VPS, then gained it back when you fucked it up while "purging PHP cache" or smth. I guess that's when you saved it?
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 Donzee seems to be saying otherwise. - https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/837985250561884191/838369832901804112/unknown.png
MTGSquad - This kid needs to be banned, would someone give me his ID? I'd like to report him to discord
DeletedUser19wxkn89s - Willypro7 im on an alt but u tried
MysteriousK69 - MTGSquad Sure, here you go. 310076789164605440 I was not sure if I could get him banned as Discord literally never takes action for my reports.
Willypro7 - MTGSquad I am not a kid, i have 16 years old, if you report for begin underage I will just present the proofs lol
Willypro7 - DeletedUser19wxkn89s proofs? I need proofs
FC5570 - Willypro7 tf is that supposed to mean
Willypro7 - FC5570 That I need proofs of scamming
FC5570 - "I am not a kid, i have 16 years old, if you report for begin underage I will just present the proofs lol"
This makes absolutely no sense for something said by a 16 year old
DeletedUser19wxkn89s - send the proof here

MysteriousK69 - MysteriousK69 Also, proof of you scamming another one of my customers. - https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/828989597978591252/838377344456458250/unknown.png

Willypro7 - MysteriousK69 And no, I didn't scammed, you did, nuking your client mysql
Willypro7 - Willypro7 So he needs to pay for a reinstall, ofc
Willypro7 - MysteriousK69 When I fixed mysql, you nuked it again. And what about telling Jonax as kid?
Willypro7 - MysteriousK69 Proof of you scamming your customers, and just taking a small piece of the ss that he thanked that I was scamming - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-02/1619955778-567278-captura-de-pantalla-2021-05-02-a-las-134253.png
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 Mind telling me when exactly did I deny reselling Contabo?
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 Proof? I am not dumb enough to do that to lose a potential customer. Stop spreading rumors - https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/828989597978591252/838380645125718026/unknown.png
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 Oh, thinking of him paying for reinstalling, I always paid you 90% of the money and got you to reinstall. It just makes sense that you did it.
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 Huh? No proof of me scamming him, its just that you were saying shit about me to everyone that caused to them thikning that I am a scammer. He bought a VPS, and got EVERYTHING that he was promised.
MysteriousK69 - @Willypro7 Also, stop pretending like you did not see the message you don't want to see.
Willypro7 - MysteriousK69

MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 For fucks sake, how much of a fucking retard can you get? I resell Contabo, everyone knows about that and I openly admit it. That is not scamming. I would suggest that you lookup the definition of the word scamming.
Willypro7 - MysteriousK69 Proof I reinstalled the mysql thing. , you and your host are just scams - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-02/1619956415-176549-captura-de-pantalla-2021-05-02-a-las-135332.png

You didn't tell it in public, you even changed the contabo welcome text to Lawliet VPS
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 You knew he would come to you, that just makes proper sense as to why you would fuck up MySQL. And, give me legit proof of me scamming.
Willypro7 - MysteriousK69 NO, you fucked up mysql and told in group if you want mysql again, pay 5$ and he dmed him telling that ofc Lawliet is a scam, 5$ for reinstalling mysql?
MysteriousK69 - @Willypro7 Also, some proof of you spreading rumors about me being a scammer to my other customers. mr Heroine, even now chooses to buy more services &amp; renew his running ones because he has a great experience.

You never told him that was contabo, he even needed to do a check from ip, also, you kicked me from the group, but do u remember telling that you wanted to do a tcp mask?
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 STOP BEING A FUCKING RETARD. KID, LISTEN CAREFULLY. UNLESS YOU GIVE ME PROOF OF ME DELETING THE FUCKING MYSQL SHIT, NO ONE GIVES A FUCK. STOP BEING A RETARDED. ALSO, YES I DID ASK FOR MONEY TO REINSTALL IT. BUT, I BY NO MEANS FUCKED IT UP. I NEVER TOUCHED HIS VPS EITHER.
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 I did not tell him that it was Contabo, and he did not ask if it was Contabo. We did not even make the slightest attempt to hide it. And, no I don't remember asking for you to mask the IP.

DID YOU, BECAUSE I WOULD NEED $ 1? YOU ONLY WANT MONEY AND YOU WOULD DO WHAT IT WAS, UNTIL YOU ERASE THE VPS TO A CUSTOMER TO HAVE MORE MONEY.
MysteriousK69 - MysteriousK69 Sorry for the caps, I just got really pissed off.
Willypro7 - MysteriousK69 Not me, in the "big bois" group, you telled to make some ip masks so he don't discover was from contabo.

Willypro7 DID YOU, BECAUSE I WOULD NEED $ 1?

What do you mean?

Willypro7 YOU ONLY WANT MONEY AND YOU WOULD DO WHAT IT WAS

First of all, I am not that desperate for 50 cents. Secondly, I am not foolish enough to risk losing a $30/m customer over 50 cents.

Willypro7 UNTIL YOU ERASE THE VPS TO A CUSTOMER TO HAVE MORE MONEY.

What?
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 I don't know if Aypro asked you to do it while I was not present, but I have never asked you to do such a thing, and never will.
Willypro7 - MysteriousK69 What do you mean?

That I didn't need the 1$, I just accepted it to help him reinstall mysql smh
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 Okay?
Willypro7 - MysteriousK69 First of all, I am not that desperate for 50 cents. Secondly, I am not foolish enough to risk losing a $30/m customer over 50 cents.

50 cents? I did it for 50 cents, you wanted to do it for 5$. 5$ for reinstalling mysql? my ass lol
Willypro7 - MysteriousK69 What?

that you would do any thing even erasing a vps just to get more money
Willypro7 - MysteriousK69 NOT ME, AYPRO, what you don't understand?
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 First of all, I set my prices. Secondly, you did it for $1 and not 50 cents. What I meant by me getting 50 cents was, I was going to ask YOU to install it and give you $4.5 (90% if you can't do math), and keep $0.5.
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 Yeah, I would do freelancing for money. If someone wants me to delete something in their VPS, yeah I would do it.
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 What I don't understand is your absolutely terrible English.
Willypro7 - MysteriousK69 Then don't make a thread smh
Willypro7 - MysteriousK69 ok, but then don't say that I scammed him, I reinstalled the mysql
MysteriousK69 - Also, @Willypro7 if you failed to realise it, this thread is more about you. Please, address the issue where you scammed me, spread rumors about us, raided our server, and accused me of scamming just because I resell Contabo and admit it.
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 I will make a thread, the community deserves to know about scamers.
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 I am sorry if you failed to understand it, but he LITERALLY SAID THAT YOU SCAMMED HIM.
Willypro7 - MysteriousK69 NO ONE FUCKING RAIDED YOUR SERVER, I STILL WAITING FOR GOOD PROOFS. YOU SCAMMED HIM, YOU ALWASY SAY THAT YOUR VPS ARE WITH YOUR OWN HARDWARE, AND NO, I DON'T SPREAD RUMORS, I SPREAD TRUTH
Willypro7 - MysteriousK69 I HAVE A FUCKING CAP OF 30 MINS AGO SAYING THAT UR HOST IS SCAM, STOP TRYING TO REVERT THINGS, YOUR CAP IS FROM A LONG AGO AND I DID THE WORK
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 

Willypro7 NO ONE FUCKING RAIDED YOUR SERVER, I STILL WAITING FOR GOOD PROOFS.

Please, look above for the proof of the server being raided. I posted the audit logs, and @Chirag even had access to checkit.

Willypro7 YOU SCAMMED HIM, YOU ALWASY SAY THAT YOUR VPS ARE WITH YOUR OWN HARDWARE,

BRUHHHHHH I legit never once said that I own the hardware. We don't even offer India location

Willypro7 AND NO, I DON'T SPREAD RUMORS, I SPREAD TRUTH

If I was a scammer, why would Heroine stick with us even after you telling him that I am a "scammer"
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 What do you mean? I don't quite get what you mean by "cap" if you care to explain.
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 And, still ignoring you scamming me.
Willypro7 - MysteriousK69 Please, look above for the proof of the server being raided. I posted the audit logs, and @Chirag even had access to checkit.

I did not have the token.

MysteriousK69 BRUHHHHHH I legit never once said that I own the hardware. We don't even offer India location
  
  Yes you told to Jonax that they was original vps, NOT RESELLING
  
  

MysteriousK69 If I was a scammer, why would Heroine stick with us even after you telling him that I am a "scammer"

Cause you lie to him lol
Willypro7 - MysteriousK69 screenshot
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7

Willypro7 I did not have the token.

Mate, you had it as you installed Dashactyl smh

Willypro7 Yes you told to Jonax that they was original vps, NOT RESELLING

I never once said that I owned the hardware.

Willypro7 Cause you lie to him lol

When? I never lied to him. Please, stop being retarded.
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 Yeah, the one where we scammed because we were "reselling"? For the millionth time, that is not considered scamming.
MysteriousK69 - MysteriousK69 Refer to this for the logs @Willypro7
Willypro7 - MysteriousK69 Mate, you had it as you installed Dashactyl smh

But I had it no longer, I just used it to configure Dashactyl

MysteriousK69 I never once said that I owned the hardware.

Yes you did

MysteriousK69 When? I never lied to him. Please, stop being retarded.

You always lie to your clients, lol
laxgorian - this thread is so much fucking funny that I had to make a account just to say @Willypro7 you have not even proved that you did not do the things mentioned in the post and you are currently sounding like a 9 year old, who's desperate enough to prove himself right but failing
Willypro7 - MysteriousK69 YES I FUCKING KNOW YOUR BOT RAIDED SERVER, BUT AND? ANY LOG ABOUT ME?
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 

Willypro7 Yes you did

When? Please, give me some damn proof retard

Willypro7 You always lie to your clients, lol

WHEN THE FUCK DID I LIE TO EVEN ONE OF MY CLIENTS? STOP MAKING UP SHIT KID
MysteriousK69 - laxgorian I know right. He is a fan of humiliating himself. Kid is probably a masochist jerking off to this
Willypro7 - laxgorian my English sounds like a 9 year old, because my English is bad. and yeah, I provided all needed proofs that make mysterious the looser.
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 

MysteriousK69 I am not going to point fingers without any reason, so let me explain myself. So, Willy can be seen using "bed" instead of "bad" almost all the time. And, the reason why all of my members were banned was "bed af server". Proof is in the screen shots below


If that was not enough, the bot that was used Lawliet Host (our official bot) banned everyone. Guess what? The only 2 people I trusted enough to give the token to were Aypro and Willy. Aypro is still trusted by me and he has no reason to raid as we are in this business together and both are making profits. Plus, he is not dumb enough to only raid the server. If Aypro wanted to ruin the company, he has the access to panel, Discord, all the VPS's, the PayPal, and pretty much everything as an admin. So, that just leaves out Willy as the only suspect for the raid. So, I think we can conclude that Willy raided Lawliet.Host's server.

Oh, and if that proof was not good enough, he holds grudges against me for making drama.gg threads against him, and not trusting him after he scammed me and did more scummy things.

Oh, and literally no one else had the token. So, who else could do it? - https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/828989597978591252/837988253519839292/unknown.png

MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 You did not give a single piece of proof till now. And, your English is not the only reason you look 9.
laxgorian - Willypro7 no you did not prove anything after reading this thread all I saw was just you accusing random people in the comments without any proof
Willypro7 - MysteriousK69 When? Please, give me some damn proof retard - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-02/1619957918-528195-captura-de-pantalla-2021-05-02-a-las-141836.png
MysteriousK69 - laxgorian Exactly. Finally, someone who actually has some brain cells
Willypro7 - laxgorian another proof for you
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 Proof of me saying it. If this would be considered proof, I can have one of your customers say that you promised them a god tier dedi for a dollar.
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 Where? I would love to see it
laxgorian - Willypro7 ok but I didn't asked for proof by the comment that I made earlier I meant that this thread is about you not about other people who you have been accusing, if you wanna talk about other people I think you should make another thread for it
MysteriousK69 - laxgorian ^

Willypro7 - Willypro7 (Your customer proving that you told him that you own hardware)
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 You uploaded this before too. This is no proof of me scamming, just give me proof of ME saying that I own the hardware, and I will admit that I am a scammer.
Willypro7 - MysteriousK69 That's the damn ss, me asking Jonax if you told him if you own ur own hardware and he responding yes
once again - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-02/1619961852-120379-1619960697-157671-captura-de-pantalla-2021-05-02-a-las-150454.png
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 Bruh, as I said earlier, I can have one of your customers say something like "he promised me an i9 9900k VPS at $1/10 GB", and would you be a scammer for not giving it then? Of course not, you need to give me actual proof of ME saying it.
Willypro7 - MysteriousK69 that's not the ip, ;-; ping ge2.moonhost.xyz that's our Germany ip
Willypro7 - MysteriousK69 I never said that, I said that you tell first that its own hardware and it's contabo reselling lol, but I never said that the hardware is fake
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 You made a typo, Germany is DE. And, okay.
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 No one said that the hardware is fake, and no one accused anyone of doing that. Are you hallucinating, or perhaps you are drunk? Underage drinking is illegal if you did not know. Anyways, I am asking for proof of me saying that I own the hardware.

Willypro7 - MysteriousK69 what? I never used token grabbers I am nice with my account
Willypro7 - MysteriousK69 No one said that the hardware is fake, and no one accused anyone of doing that. Are you hallucinating, or perhaps you are drunk? Underage drinking is illegal if you did not know. Anyways, I am asking for proof of me saying that I own the hardware.
  
I am not underage, proofs? The guy who told that already deleted the msg as it is fake. I am fucking giving you the damn picture that says that u told one of ur clients that you own hardware
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 Look at the screenies?
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 

Willypro7 I am not underage, proofs? The guy who told that already deleted the msg as it is fake.

The legal age for drinking is 21.

Willypro7 I am fucking giving you the damn picture that says that u told one of ur clients that you own hardware

Read the message I wrote.
Willypro7 - MysteriousK69 The legal age for drinking is 21.

;-; In spain is 18, and I don't drink, I am 16 stfu

MysteriousK69 Anyways, I am asking for proof of me saying that I own the hardware.


do you know how to read? lol - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-02/1619964472-407785-captura-de-pantalla-2021-05-02-a-las-160750.png
MysteriousK69 - Willypro7 ;-; In spain is 18, and I don't drink, I am 16 stfu

Oh, thanks for the information, I appreciate it.

Willypro7 do you know how to read? lol

I do, but I think you don't. I am asking for proof of ME saying that I own the hardware. Not my customer saying that I said I own the hardware.
MysteriousK69 - And, they don't even have a board of directors or a chairman. 

Edit: Ignore Michael in the background, please.
Another edit: Please correct me if I am wrong about it being illegal to operate without a chairman or a board. - https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/828989597978591252/838783013911396402/unknown.png
Bxrk - MysteriousK69 what a bitch
MysteriousK69 - Bxrk That's just scummy, to steal someones Discord account.
Daftscientist - RumGuru hes stupid, thats why i left, i joined the host before he was in the host.
PugRug - MysteriousK69 I agree with this statement.
z_t0ht - MysteriousK69 Well we did buy servers for nodes and we were not using the free trial as I signed up way before they even had the offer.
MysteriousK69 - z_t0ht Ok. Though, why bother replying to this thread after it has died and Willy has just decided to ignore it &amp; given up?
Mohamol334 - Willypro7 

only I have proof
xd
MysteriousK69 - Updated the thread if it even matters anymore.
Spoony - Idk how people protect this retard, try to prove that he is above the age of 9  @Willypro7 The kid has pro in his name, doesn't know how to spell, idk how it isn't obvious smh
MysteriousK69 - Spoony ikr lmfao
Mohamol334 - I don’t know what Willypro7 has done, but I got mad at him once, and lied about him being 12 years old. When we became friends again, I deleted the message, thinking it would work out, but now everyone thinks it's true. Willy is 14 years old. It is the only truth
NotAypro - Mohamol334 Willy told that his age is 16 then you said that he was 12 now you are saying that his age is 14 smh, idk why but I feel like you are being forced by willy to say this
