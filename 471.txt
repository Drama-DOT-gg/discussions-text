BxdrLOL - Ryan himself knows that what he has done isn't fair or cool of him. After telling him that he has stolen my idea since he has dmed me about it then started to use it, i have blocked him in the hope of him understanding what he is doing which he did by pinging me in a server and telling me that he is sorry about what he did and it was all because he wanted money. When i confront him about it he sends me a question mark and deletes all his messages from the server but i had luckily taken a screenshot before deletion and here it is. - https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/780764473119604766/841000345529745458/unknown.png

BaconHead - omg bxdr is so fcking toxic he uses some special hacks to get more live widgets on arc.io
Here's proof: 
Also he even said that he "started using arc.io yesterday" 2 times: The first time, he said it in the screenshot above. A few days later he said it again. For the second time he said that he "started using arc.io yesterday", I couldn't find any proof, because he deleted his message.
Him being toxic after I exposed him for saying that he "started using arc.io yesterday" 2 times: - https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-24/1621846272-323205-4ff21495-4746-48bb-80fa-c944a8091d27.jpg
